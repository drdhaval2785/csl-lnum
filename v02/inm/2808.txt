{@Śukakṛti(ḥ)@}¦ (“the works of Śuka”). § 713 (Mokṣadh.):
<div n="lb">XII, {@326—7@} (12215—12311) (continuation of {%Śukotpatti%}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira: Vyāsa%} desired {%Śuka%} to study
<div n="lb">the {%Mokṣadharma; Śuka%} mastered all the treatises on {%yoga,%}
<div n="lb">as also the science promulgated by {%Kapila.%} Then {%Vyāsa%} caused
<div n="lb">him to go to {%Janaka,%} the king of {%Mithilā,%} and not to the skies
<div n="lb">(by his {%yoga%} power); nor should he think himself superior to
<div n="lb">{%Janaka,%} though he was only his {%yājya.%} Crossing the Varṣas
<div n="lb">of {%Meru%} and {%Hari%} and {%Himavat (Meror Hareś ca dve varṣe%}
<div n="lb">{%varṣaṃ Haimavatan tataḥ), Śuka%} came to {%Bhāratavarṣa.%}
<div n="lb">Having seen many countries inhabited by {%Cīnas%} and {%Hūṇas,%}
<div n="lb">he reached {%Āryāvarta,%} and at last the country of the {%Videhas,%}
<div n="lb">protected by {%Janaka,%} and then {%Mithilā.%} He had not been
<div n="lb">fatigued on the way. He obtained permission to enter the
<div n="lb">city, but was at first roughly forbidden to enter the palace.
<div n="lb">At last he was admitted into the first chamber; thence he was
<div n="lb">led into the second chamber by the minister, and thence into
<div n="lb">a garden that was like a second {%Caitraratha,%} with damsels
<div n="lb">equal to the Aps., who entertained {%Śuka%} and gave him to
<div n="lb">eat; he, however, went unaffected through his rites, and in
<div n="lb">the first part of the night he devoted himself to {%yoga%} (XII,
<div n="lb">{@326@}). The next morning he was received by {%Janaka,%} and
<div n="lb">was instructed by him about {%mokṣa%} and the duties of
<div n="lb">a brahman; “ordinarily the purified understanding necessary
<div n="lb">for attaining {%mokṣa%} cannot be obtained without passing
<div n="lb">through all four stages of religious life; but he who in the
<div n="lb">course of many births has obtained a pure mind, may attain
<div n="lb">to {%mokṣa%} even in the very first stage (i.e. brahmacarya), and
<div n="lb">then there is no need for the three other stages,” quoting
<div n="lb">a saying of king {%Yayāti;%} “through the favour of thy father
<div n="lb">I have acquired to omniscience; thy knowledge is much
<div n="lb">greater than what you think it to be” (XII, {@327@}). (For
<div n="lb">continuation v. {%Śukakṛtya.%})
