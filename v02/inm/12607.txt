[Page774-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the {%Maruts,%} and the {%Vasus,%} wandering about in {%Devaloka%} and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmaloka.%} One day {%Indra%} asked him what he had said to
<div n="lb">{%Pūru%} when he bestowed the kingdom upon him. {%Y.%} answered
<div n="lb">that he had said: “The whole country between the {%Gaṅgā%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Yamunā%} is thine, this is the central region of the earth,
<div n="lb">the outlying regions will be the dominions of thy brothers.
<div n="lb">Those without anger are ever superior to those under its

<div n="lb">equal in ascetic austerities among men, gods, {%Gandharvas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%maharṣis, Indra%} declared that, owing to this haughtiness,
<div n="lb">he should fall from heaven, yet he should fall among the
<div n="lb">virtuous. When falling, he was beheld by the {%rājarṣi%}
<div n="lb">{%Aṣṭaka%} (I, {@88@}), of whom he was the maternal grandfather;
<div n="lb">{%Y.%} spoke disapprovingly of haughtiness, etc., and told that,
<div n="lb">leaving earth, he had obtained many high regions for 1,000
<div n="lb">years, then he had dwelt in the town of {%Indra%} (having 1,000
<div n="lb">gates and extending 1,000 yojanas all around) for 1,000 years,
<div n="lb">then for 1,000 years in the world of {%Prajāpati,%} then in the
<div n="lb">abode of {%Devadeva%} (i.e. Viṣṇu); he had also dwelt in
<div n="lb">{%Nandana%} for 100 ayutas of years, assuming any form at will,
<div n="lb">sporting with the Apsarases; then there had come a messenger
<div n="lb">of the gods with a grim visage, who thrice had shouted to
<div n="lb">him “fall”; then he had fallen from {%Nandana,%} hearing,
<div n="lb">while falling, the compassionate exclamations of the gods,
<div n="lb">who had directed him to fall to the sacrificial place of
<div n="lb">{%Aṣṭaka%} and his companions (I, {@89@}). {%Y.%} continued: Those
<div n="lb">who speak of their own merits after having dwelt for 60,000
<div n="lb">or 80,000 years in heaven, are doomed to suffer the pains of
<div n="lb">the hell called {%bhauma%} (i.e. existence on the earth), and are
<div n="lb">attacked by certain {%Rākṣasas%} with sharp teeth. {%Y.%} then
<div n="lb">taught the lore of transmigration and emancipation (I, {@90@}).
<div n="lb">{%Y.%} explained the duties of {%gṛhasthas, bhikṣus, brahmacārins,%}
<div n="lb">and {%vānaprasthas,%} and the different kinds of {%munis%} and {%mauna%}
<div n="lb">(vows of silence) (I, {@91@}). {%Y.%} then said: “I now shall fall
