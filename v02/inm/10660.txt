{@Svargārohaṇika(ṃ) parva(n)@}¦ (“Bhīṣma's ascension
<div n="lb">to Heaven”), the 92nd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
<div n="lb">§ 10 (Pārvas.): I, {@2,@} 353.—§ 777. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said:
<div n="lb">When {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had taken leave of the citizens, etc., he
<div n="lb">comforted the widows, whose husbands had been slain, with
[Page670-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">abundant gifts, and being duly installed on the throne, he
<div n="lb">reassured all his subjects [by acts of goodwill], etc. After
<div n="lb">fifty days, seeing that the sun had begun its northern course,
<div n="lb">he set out to see {%Bhīṣma,%} taking with him what was necessary
<div n="lb">for the latter's cremation, accompanied by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī, Kuntī,%} his brothers, {%Kṛṣṇa, Vidura, Yuyutsu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yuyudhāna,%} and his other relatives and a great retinue, and
<div n="lb">his priests. He beheld {%Bhīṣma%} surrounded by Ṛ {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Nārada, Asita Devala,%} and by the remnant of unslain kings
<div n="lb">from various parts of the country, guarded by the warriors
<div n="lb">appointed for that duty; all the inhabitants of {%Kurujāṅgala%}
<div n="lb">were also there. When {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had told his errand,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} opened his eyes and saw all the {%Bharatas%} assembled.
<div n="lb">He seized the hand of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and welcomed him; he
<div n="lb">had now been lying there for fifty-eight nights, which he had
<div n="lb">felt to be as long as a century; now it was the bright fort-
<div n="lb">night of {%Māgha,%} and of this one-fourth had passed away.
<div n="lb">Then he reminded {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of the instructions he had
<div n="lb">received from {%Vyāsa,%} and that he should regard the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">and especially {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} as his own sons. Then he praised
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} as the Supreme God, and asked him to grant him
<div n="lb">leave to die, and that he should ever protect the {%Pāṇḍavas;%}
<div n="lb">he complained that {%Duryodhana%} had never been willing to
<div n="lb">follow his counsels; he said that he knew from {%Nārada%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa,%} that {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} were Ṛ {%Nārāyaṇa%} and {%Nara,%}
<div n="lb">who had lived for a long time in {%Badarī. Kṛṣṇa%} then gave
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} leave to die and come to the {%Vasus,%} comparing him
<div n="lb">to {%Mārkaṇḍeya.%} Having given some few admonitions to
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (XIII, {@168@}), {%Bhīṣma%} successively caused
<div n="lb">his life-breaths to leave his body, and the parts of his body
<div n="lb">became successively free from wounds and arrows, at which
<div n="lb">the bystanders became filled with wonder. His soul passed
<div n="lb">through the crown of his head, ascended to heaven like a
<div n="lb">meteor, and soon became invisible, while the celestial kettle-
<div n="lb">drums began to play, a rain of flowers fell down, and Si.
<div n="lb">and B-ṛ. applauded. Then the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) cremated
<div n="lb">the corpse. Then, accompanied by Ṛ., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), they pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded to {%Bhāgīrathī%} (Gaṅgā), where they offered oblations
<div n="lb">of water to {%Bhīṣma.%} Then {%Bhāgīrathī%} appeared and, weeping,
<div n="lb">praised {%Bhīṣma%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%} comforted her, mentioning the
<div n="lb">present felicity of {%Bhīṣma%} as one of the {%Vasus,%} and declared
<div n="lb">that he had not been slain by {%Śikhaṇḍin,%} but by {%Arjuna.%}
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%} gave up her grief; all the kings, headed by {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">obtained her permission to depart, and all returned [to the
<div n="lb">city] (XIII, {@169@}).
