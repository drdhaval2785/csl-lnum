[{@Nahuṣopākhyāna@}]¦ (“the episode relating to Nahuṣa”).
<div n="lb">§ 755{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Nahuṣa,%} having acquired the
<div n="lb">sovereignty of heaven, performed both human and celestial
<div n="lb">acts, for instance {%bali%} and offering of incense and of light, etc.;
<div n="lb">and although he had become the chief of the gods, he yet
<div n="lb">worshipped the gods as in days of yore. But then he was
<div n="lb">filled with pride in consequence of the boon he had received
<div n="lb">from all the gods, and he ceased to perform religious actions;
<div n="lb">for a very long time he used to employ the Ṛ. by turns as the
<div n="lb">bearers of his vehicles; but in consequence of his abstention
<div n="lb">from religious acts his energy began to diminish; when it was
<div n="lb">{%Agastya's%} turn to carry the vehicle, {%Bhṛgu%} came to the hermitage
<div n="lb">of {%Agastya (Maitrāvaruṇi),%} and when the latter, mentioning
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán's%} boon to {%Nahuṣa%} (that whoever would come within
<div n="lb">the range of his eyesight would, deprived of all energy, be
<div n="lb">within his sway), and that {%Brahmán%} had given him {%aṃṛta%}
[Page495-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">to drink, despaired of being able to curse him, {%Bhṛgu%} said
<div n="lb">that he had come at the command of {%Brahmán,%} and that he
<div n="lb">would curse {%Nahuṣa%} to be a snake, when he insulted {%Agastya%}
<div n="lb">by a kick, and this very day he would hurl him down and
<div n="lb">re-establish {%Indra. Agastya%} became highly gratified (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@99@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} continued [referring
<div n="lb">to and developing the beginning of XIII, {@99:@} {%Nahuṣa's%}
<div n="lb">sacrificial rites and presents were obstructed by Rā.]: {%Nahuṣa%}
<div n="lb">ordered Ṛ. {%Agastya%} to carry the vehicle from the banks of
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī. Bhṛgu,%} telling {%Agastya%} to close his eyes, had
<div n="lb">entered the matted locks of {%Agastya,%} taking care not to cast
<div n="lb">his eyes upon {%Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa%} urged {%Agastya%} on with
<div n="lb">his goad and then struck him on the head with his left foot.
<div n="lb">Then {%Nahuṣa%} was cursed by {%Bhṛgu%} and transformed into
<div n="lb">a snake, but, in consequence of his gifts, etc., he retained his
<div n="lb">memory, and, assisted by {%Agastya,%} pacified {%Bhṛgu,%} who said
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would rescue him, and then went to the
<div n="lb">abode of {%Brahmán%} and informed him, while {%Agastya%} returned
<div n="lb">to his own hermitage. {%Brahmán%} once more installed (caused
<div n="lb">the gods to instal) {%Indra%} in the sovereignty of heaven. “Thou
<div n="lb">hast, O king, rescued {%Nahuṣa%} from {%Bhṛgu's%} curse; he ascended
<div n="lb">to the abode of {%Brahmán%} before thy eyes; in consequence of
<div n="lb">the merits he had acquired through acts of the kind I have
<div n="lb">mentioned, he succeeded in once more regaining his lost
<div n="lb">position. Hence, when evening comes, persons leading the
<div n="lb">domestic mode of life, should give lamps” (XIII, {@100@}).
