<div n="lb">§ 773{%c%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: [Formerly] I put up in
<div n="lb">my house the brahman {%Durvāsas,%} who was green and tawny,
<div n="lb">clad in rags {%(cīravāsāḥ),%} who had a stick of {%Bilva (Ægle%}
<div n="lb">{%marmelos,%} Linn.), a long beard, who was emaciated, taller
<div n="lb">than the tallest men; he wandered over all the celestial and
<div n="lb">human worlds, singing this verse at congregations and in public
<div n="lb">squares: “Who would cause the brahman {%D.%} to dwell in his
<div n="lb">house? He becomes enraged with everyone even at the
<div n="lb">slightest transgression; he that would give me shelter should
<div n="lb">not anger me.” As no one took notice of him (read with B.
<div n="lb">{%°n nādriyate%}), I invited him. Sometimes he would eat food
<div n="lb">sufficient for many thousand persons, sometimes very little,
<div n="lb">and [sometimes] he would not return home; he would laugh
<div n="lb">and weep without any visible reason; no one at that time was
<div n="lb">equal to him in years; [one day] he burnt all the beds and
<div n="lb">coverlets and all the well-adorned damsels, and then went
<div n="lb">out; then he asked for rice-milk {%(pāyasa);%} having previously
<div n="lb">caused every kind of food and drink to be kept ready,
<div n="lb">I caused hot rice-milk to be brought; having eaten some, he
<div n="lb">ordered me to smear my limbs with the remnant, which I did;
<div n="lb">then he smeared {%Rukmiṇī,%} and causing her to be yoked to
<div n="lb">a chariot, he, ascending that chariot, set out of my house,
<div n="lb">striking her with the hook, and proceeded along the high
<div n="lb">road; the {%Dāśarhas%} became angry; as {%Rukmiṇī%} tottered, he
<div n="lb">struck her [with the whip]; then he leapt down from the
<div n="lb">chariot and fled towards the south on foot, followed by us.
<div n="lb">Then he became gratified because I had subdued my anger,
<div n="lb">and said: “As long as gods and men will continue to
<div n="lb">entertain a liking for food, so long will everyone among
<div n="lb">them cherish the same liking for thee; so long as there
<div n="lb">will be righteous [men] {%(puṇyāḥ)%} in the worlds, so long
<div n="lb">will thy fame last; agreeable thou shalt be to all persons;
<div n="lb">whatever articles of thine have been broken or burnt or
<div n="lb">destroyed, thou shalt see restored or even better; thou
<div n="lb">wilt have no fear of death through such parts of thy body
<div n="lb">as have been smeared [with the rice-milk]; thou ought
<div n="lb">to have smeared also the soles of thy feet.” I saw my body
<div n="lb">endued with great beauty and splendour. He also blessed
<div n="lb">{%Rukmiṇī,%} saying: “Thou shalt be the foremost of women in
<div n="lb">fame, etc., free from decrepitude or diseases or loss of
<div n="lb">complexion, possessed of a fragrant odour, the foremost of
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa's%} 60,000 wives, and [after death] thou shalt dwell in
<div n="lb">the same world as {%Kṛṣṇa.%}” Having recommended me to be
<div n="lb">always thus disposed towards the brahmans, he disappeared.
<div n="lb">I and {%Rukmiṇī%} took the vow of always satisfying the brahmans.
<div n="lb">Having entered our house, I saw that everything which {%D.%} had
<div n="lb">broken or burnt had become renewed. From that day forth
<div n="lb">I have always worshipped the brahmans: XIII, {@160,@} 7416,
