{@[Nārāyaṇāstramokṣaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the section
<div n="lb">including the hurling of the Nārāyaṇa weapon”), the 78th of
<div n="lb">the minor parvans of the Mhbhr. § 603. THE LAST PART OF
<div n="lb">THE 15TH DAY. After the fall of {%Droṇa,%} the {%Kurus,%} even
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), fled away, {%Kṛtavarman%} with the
<div n="lb">remnant of his {%Bhoja%} troops, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Suśarman%} with the
<div n="lb">remnant of the {%Saṃśaptakas.%} Only {%Aśvatthāman%} did not flee:
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} & {%Śikhaṇḍin,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Aśvatthāman%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} why the troops were fleeing away, even {%Karṇa's%}
<div n="lb">troops; {%Duryodhana%} caused {%Kṛpa%} to inform {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">of the truth (<lang n="greek"></lang>), at which {%Aśvatthāman%} was filled with
<div n="lb">rage (VII, {@193@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} what
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} said (<lang n="greek"></lang>), he who knew the weapons of
<div n="lb">men and {%Vāruṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VII, {@194@}). {%Sañjaya%} related:
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} complained before {%Duryodhana%} that his father
<div n="lb">has been killed (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and vowed to destroy the {%Pāñcālas%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} neither D., nor G., As., U., Rā., etc., were
<div n="lb">able to vanquish him; there were none equal to him and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} in knowledge of weapons; he had a weapon (the
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon) that neither {%Arjuna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) knew, given
<div n="lb">by {%Nārāyaṇa%} to his father as a boon, with the promise that
<div n="lb">no man should ever be his equal in battle; only, this
<div n="lb">weapon must never be used in haste, etc., and never be
<div n="lb">hurled upon persons that abandon their chariots or weapons in
<div n="lb">battle, etc.; with this he would rout and slay the {%Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The {%Kuru%} army rallied; many blew their conches,
<div n="lb">etc.; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} took counsel of one another; {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">touched water and invoked the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon (VII,
<div n="lb">{@195@}). Fierce omens in nature appeared. D., Dā., and G.
<div n="lb">became inspired with fear. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">what counsel was adopted by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in order to protect
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} on seeing the retreating {%Kauravas%} once more
<div n="lb">advance to battle, rallied by {%Aśvatthāman. Sañjaya%} related:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke about the matter to {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), fearing
<div n="lb">that it was {%Indra%} himself who was approaching for the sake
<div n="lb">of the {%Kauravas. Arjuna%} in reply described the prowess of
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} and the unrighteousness of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in
<div n="lb">slaying {%Droṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “all of us have passed the greater part
<div n="lb">of our lives; the days that remain to us are few; this
<div n="lb">exceedingly unrighteous act has stained that remnant”;
<div n="lb">“I did not interfere, as he was about to be slain; for this
<div n="lb">fault I have already sunk into hell, overcome with shame”
[Page511-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">(VII, {@196@}). {%Bhīmasena,%} reproaching {%Arjuna,%} vindicated the
<div n="lb">deed (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “I can, with my arrows, rout the united D. with
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} at their head, and As., U., and men.” Then
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} spoke in justification of his conduct (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(VII, {@197@}). Asked by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Sañjaya%} related:
<div n="lb">All the other persons present remained silent; {%Arjuna,%} glancing
<div n="lb">obliquely towards {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} seemed to reproach him
<div n="lb">with tears and sighs; {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) stood ashamed;
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki%} wrathfully rebuked {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna%} in reply taunted {%Sātyaki%} with the slaughter of
<div n="lb">{%Bhūriśrasas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Sātyaki%} rushed towards {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">in order to slay him; {%Bhīma,%} urged by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} held him
<div n="lb">back; {%Sahadeva%} endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} asked {%Bhīma%} to let him slay {%Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); then he or {%Arjuna%} would slay the enemies. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} restored peace with great difficulty, and all
<div n="lb">the warriors proceeded to battle (VII, {@198@}). {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">caused a great carnage among the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops (description);
<div n="lb">before {%Duryodhana%} he repeated his vow (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">rallied his troops. {%Aśvatthāman%} invoked the {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">weapon (description). The {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), became
<div n="lb">exceedingly agitated. {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} relying on {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">advised {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to flee away with his {%Pāñcālas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sātyaki%} with the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas;%} he and his
<div n="lb">brothers would ascend a funeral pile (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%} prevailed
<div n="lb">upon the troops to lay down their weapons and alight from
<div n="lb">their chariots. {%Bhīmasena%} alone refused to do so, and dissuaded
<div n="lb">the others (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Arjuna%} said that his vow was that the
<div n="lb">{%Gāṇḍīva%} should not be used against the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon,
<div n="lb">kine, and brahmans. {%Bhīma%} attacked {%Aśvatthāman,%} but was
<div n="lb">overwhelmed by the energy of the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon
<div n="lb">(VII, {@199@}). {%Arjuna%} covered {%Bhīmasena%} with the {%Vāruṇa%}
<div n="lb">weapon, {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} alighting from their chariot,
<div n="lb">proceeded on foot towards {%Bhīma%} and forcibly brought him
<div n="lb">down from his chariot, making him abandon his weapons.
<div n="lb">Then the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon became neutralized; all the
<div n="lb">quarters became clear, etc. The {%Pāṇḍava%} host stood arrayed
<div n="lb">once more. {%Duryodhana%} urged {%Aśvatthāman%} to use the
<div n="lb">same weapon once more; {%Aśvatthāman%} said that it could
<div n="lb">not be used twice; if brought back it would without doubt
<div n="lb">slay himself. {%Duryodhana%} then urged him to slay the
<div n="lb">enemies with other weapons. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked, what then
<div n="lb">came to pass (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sañjaya%} related: {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} &
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman,%} who deprived {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} of his steeds,
<div n="lb">driver, and chariot; the {%Pāñcālas%} fled away. {%Sātyaki%} &
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman,%} who was worsted by him. {%Duryodhana,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), & {%Sātyaki,%} who made them flee away deprived of their
<div n="lb">chariots. {%Aśvatthāman%} (upon another chariot) & {%Sātyaki,%}
<div n="lb">who once more deprived him of his chariot and caused him
<div n="lb">to retreat; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} blew their conches, and {%Sātyaki%} slew
<div n="lb">300 of {%Vṛṣasena's%} division, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Aśvatthāman%} (upon
<div n="lb">another chariot) & {%Sātyaki; Aśvatthāman%} repeated his vow
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sātyaki%} was carried away by his driver. {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">& {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} who was much afflicted; {%Arjuna,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), & {%Aśvatthāman,%} who slew {%Sudarśana%} (the {%Mālava%}
<div n="lb">king), {%Paurava (Bṛhatkṣattra),%} and the young {%Cedi%} prince.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} & {%Aśvatthāman; Bhīma%} was carried away by his
<div n="lb">steeds; the {%Pāñcālas%} fled away (VII, {@200@}). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">{%(+ Kṛṣṇa)%} (rallying his troops) & {%Aśvatthāman%} (+ the
<div n="lb">{%Kauravas%}); {%Arjuna%} addressed {%Aśvatthāman%} in harsh words
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} about the cause of this, as
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} and {%Aśvatthāman%} loved each other. {%Sañjaya%} said
<div n="lb">that it was in consequence of his grief (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Aśvatthāman%}
[Page512-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">became angry with {%Arjuna%} and especially with {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">touched water, and made use of the {%Āgneya%} weapon, from
<div n="lb">which dire omens in nature appeared, and a great slaughter
<div n="lb">in the {%Pāṇḍava%} army resulted; Rā. and Pś. uttered fierce
<div n="lb">cries, etc. (description). {%Arjuna%} invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon:
<div n="lb">the darkness was dispelled, etc.; a full {%akṣauhiṇī%} of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍava%} troops had been killed; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} were
<div n="lb">unwounded; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} rejoiced, the {%Kauravas%} wondered,
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} was disconsolate, and ran away from the fight;
<div n="lb">he met {%Vyāsa,%} and asked him the reason; “neither As., nor
<div n="lb">G., Pś., Rā., U., Y., and birds, nor men can baffle this
<div n="lb">weapon.” {%Vyāsa%} told him the story of {%Nārāyaṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>);%}
<div n="lb">{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} are {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa;%} even {%Aśvatthā—%}
<div n="lb">{%man%} has been born as a portion of {%Rudra,%} and was [in a former
<div n="lb">birth] endued with great wisdom, regarding the universe to
<div n="lb">consist only of {%Mahādeva,%} etc., and {%Śiva%} had granted him
<div n="lb">numerous boons, and he had, in every {%Yuga,%} adored the
<div n="lb">great god in his {%Phallic%} form. {%Kṛṣṇa%} had sprung from
<div n="lb">{%Rudra%} himself, and always worshipped him, regarding his
<div n="lb">{%Phallic%} emblem as the origin of the universe, and he viewed
<div n="lb">the identity of {%Bráhman%} with the universe; D., Si., and
<div n="lb">M.-ṛ. adore {%Kṛṣṇa%} in order to attain to {%Mahādeva; Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">is the Creator of everything; the eternal {%Kṛṣṇa%} should be
<div n="lb">adored with sacrifices, etc. {%Aśvatthāman%} bowed unto {%Rudra,%}
<div n="lb">regarded {%Kṛṣṇa%} as worthy of the highest regards, and
<div n="lb">became filled with delight, the marks whereof appeared on
<div n="lb">his body. Bowing to {%Vyāsa,%} he caused the army to be
<div n="lb">withdrawn, and so did also the {%Pāṇḍavas.%} Having fought
<div n="lb">for five days…,{%Droṇa%} repaired to {%Brahmaloka%} (VII, {@201@}).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} met with {%Vyāsa%} and inquired of him about the
<div n="lb">invisible person who aided him in the battle; {%Vyāsa%} said
<div n="lb">that it was {%Mahādeva%} himself, and recited a long enumeration
<div n="lb">of his attributes (<lang n="greek"></lang>); if {%Mahādeva%} becomes angry, neither
<div n="lb">D., nor As., G., Rā., even if they hide themselves in deep
<div n="lb">caves, can have peace. In days of yore {%Mahādeva%} destroyed
<div n="lb">the sacrifice of {%Dakṣa;%} the {%Sacrifice%} fled away, and D. and
<div n="lb">As. fell down and submitted to {%Mahādeva,%} the {%Nāgas%} and Ṛ.
<div n="lb">became agitated, etc.; {%Pūṣan%} was eating the {%puroḍāśa:%}
<div n="lb">{%Śiva%} tore out his teeth; the gods assigned to {%Rudra%} a
<div n="lb">substantial share in sacrifices; he then re-established the
<div n="lb">sacrifice. Then {%Vyāsa%} related the destruction of {%Tripura (d).%}
<div n="lb">He [{%Śiva%}] is {%Rudra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Explanation of some of the
<div n="lb">names of {%Mahādeva%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Blessings upon the reader,
<div n="lb">especially the readers of the {%Śatarudriya%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VII, {@202@}).
