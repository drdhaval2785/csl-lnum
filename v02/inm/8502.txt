{@[Prajāgaraparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“section relating to the
<div n="lb">sleeplessness of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,” the 59th of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mhbhr.; cf. Prajāgara). § 557: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} after
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} had left him, requested {%Vidura%} to tell him what
<div n="lb">may be good for a person that is sleepless and burning.
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} said that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was worthy of being the
<div n="lb">sovereign over the three worlds, while the qualities of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} were the very reverse of those; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">had no right to a share in the kingdom owing to his being
[Page556-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">blind; {%Vidura%} blamed him for having bestowed on {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni, Karṇa,%} and {%Duḥśāsana%} the management of the
<div n="lb">empire. Then he explained the marks of a wise man and
<div n="lb">of a fool, quoting {%Bṛhaspati's%} answer to {%Indra,%} and alluding
<div n="lb">to the conversation between {%Sudhanvan%} and {%Asurendra%}
<div n="lb">[i.e. {%Prahlāda%}] in relation to the son of the latter (V, {@33@}).
<div n="lb">Continuation of {%Vidura's%} discourse (V, {@34@}).—§ 558: {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">said that as long as a man's good deeds are spoken of in this
<div n="lb">world, so long he is glorified in heaven, and cited the old
<div n="lb">story about the conversation between {%Virocana%} (q.v.) and
<div n="lb">{%Sudhanvan,%} both suitors for {%Keśinī's%} hand. “Entrusting the
<div n="lb">cares of thy kingdom to {%Duryodhana, Śakuni,%} the foolish
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana,%} and to {%Karṇa,%} how canst thou hope for prosperity?
<div n="lb">Possessed of every virtue, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} depend on thee as
<div n="lb">their father; oh, confide thou in them as thy sons” (V, {@35@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 559: {%Vidura%} related the old history of the discourse
<div n="lb">between {%Ātreya%} and the {%Sādhyas,%} who received instruction
<div n="lb">from {%Ātreya%} when he was wandering as a beggar (“…
<div n="lb">One should not return the slanders or reproaches of others,
<div n="lb">for the pain that is felt by him who suffers silently, consumes
<div n="lb">the slanderer; and he that endures, succeeds also in
<div n="lb">appropriating the virtues of the slanderer—the slanderer's
<div n="lb">merits become his…The very gods desire company of
<div n="lb">that man who, when abused, does not himself return the
<div n="lb">abuse nor cause others to return it, or who, when beaten,
<div n="lb">does not himself return the blow nor cause others to do it,
<div n="lb">and who wishes not the slightest injury to him that injures
<div n="lb">him…”). Then he explained what are those families
<div n="lb">that are called high (“…let none in our race serve
<div n="lb">a king as minister”) (V, {@36@}). {%Vidura%} spoke of the seven
<div n="lb">and ten kinds of foolish men according to {%Manu Svāyam-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhuva;%} of the reasons why not all men attain the allotted
<div n="lb">period of life (100 years according to the {%Veda%}), etc. But
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} could not abandon his son (V, {@37—40@}).
