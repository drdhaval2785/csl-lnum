[{@Vaivāhikaparvan@}<sup>1</sup>]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">marriage of Draupadī with the Pāṇḍavas”, the 13th of the
<div n="lb">minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Vaivāhika.) § 237.
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} related what had happened: ({%Arjuna%} had
<div n="lb">large red eyes, v. 7175, and {%Kṛṣṇā%} had followed him, catching
<div n="lb">hold of his deerskin. v. 7177); from their conversation on
[Page704-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">military subjects, he concluded that they were the {%Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb">of whom it had been heard that they had all escaped from
<div n="lb">the lac-house. {%Drupada%} (= {%Saumaki,%} v. 7198) sent his
<div n="lb">{%purohita%} to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who said that there was no occasion
<div n="lb">for {%Drupada%} to grieve for his daughter. While {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">was saying this, another messenger from {%Drupada%} announced
<div n="lb">that the feast was ready (I, {@193@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas,%} with
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī%} and {%Kṛṣṇā%} were conveyed to {%Drupada's%} palace.
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} wished to ascertain to which caste they belonged,
<div n="lb">and had for that purpose made ready a large collection of
<div n="lb">various articles appertaining to different human occupations;
<div n="lb">after dinner they began to observe, with interest, the imple-
<div n="lb">ments of war, wherefore {%Drupada%} and his son thought that
<div n="lb">they were of royal blood (I, {@194@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} who they were. {%Drupada%} vowed to restore {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} to his kingdom. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told him that they
<div n="lb">would all marry {%Kṛṣṇā,%} which {%Drupada%} considered to be
<div n="lb">contrary to morality. While they discoursed on this matter
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} arrived (I, {@195@}). {%Drupada%} consulted {%Vyāsa%} about
<div n="lb">the wedding of his daughter. {%Vyāsa%} desired to hear the
<div n="lb">opinion of each of them. {%Drupada%} regarded the practice
<div n="lb">of marrying one wife to five men as sinful, and so did
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Yudhiṣṭhira%} thought it not to be sinful,
<div n="lb">because his heart, that never inclined to what was sinful,
<div n="lb">approved of it; “it is recorded in the {%Purāṇa%} that {%Jaṭilā%}
<div n="lb">{%Gautamī%} had married seven {%ṛṣis,%} and a {%muni's%} daughter, born
<div n="lb">of a tree ({%Vārkṣī%} [= {%Māriṣā,%} BR.], see Hariv., v. 96 foll.)
<div n="lb">married the ten {%Pracetases%}”; moreover, their mother {%Kuntī%}
<div n="lb">had told them to enjoy her all. {%Kuntī%} was afraid that she
<div n="lb">would be guilty of a lie. {%Vyāsa%} said that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was
<div n="lb">right, and took {%Drupada%} apart (I, {@196@}) and related to him
<div n="lb">{%Pañcendropākhyāna%} (§§ 238—239).—§ 240. {%Drupada%} then
<div n="lb">consented, as it had been ordained by the gods. {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">declared that very day to be auspicious as the moon entered
<div n="lb">in conjunction with {%Puṣya (Pauṣyaṃ yogam upaiti).%}
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} and his son made preparations for the wedding, and
<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya,%} performing the usual rites, married {%Kṛṣṇā%} to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and then to his brothers on successive
<div n="lb">days. {%Draupadī%} regained her virginity every day after
<div n="lb">her previous marriage. Then {%Drupada%} gave to them various
<div n="lb">kinds of excellent wealth (I, {@198@}). {%Drupada,%} after his
<div n="lb">alliance with the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} had all his fears dispelled. His
<div n="lb">ladies worshipped the feet of {%Kunitī. Kuntī%} pronounced a
<div n="lb">blessing upon {%Kṛṣṇā. Kṛṣṇa%} sent them costly presents
<div n="lb">(I, {@199@}).
