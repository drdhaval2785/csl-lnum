{@Mṛtyu@}<sup>4</sup>¦ (“Death”), fem. § 594 (Akampana): Nārada said
<div n="lb">to Akampana: In the beginning the Grandsire {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">created all creatures. As the creation bore no sign of
<div n="lb">decay, he began to think about the destruction of the
<div n="lb">universe. Failing to find any means of destruction, he
<div n="lb">became angry, and in consequence of his anger a fire sprang
<div n="lb">from the apertures of his body {%(khebhyaḥ)%} and destroyed
<div n="lb">all creatures. Then {%Śiva%} (the lord of all the wanderers
<div n="lb">at night) appealed to {%Brahmán%} (the greatest of ascetics),
<div n="lb">who said, “Thou hast been born out of our wish” {%(kāmāt)%}
<div n="lb">(VII, {@52@}), and that the Earth, afflicted with the heavy
<div n="lb">weight of creatures, had asked him to destroy them. {%Śiva,%}
<div n="lb">saying that he had been appointed by {%Brahmán%} the protector
<div n="lb">of creatures, prevailed upon {%Brahmán%} to keep his wrath
<div n="lb">within his own inner self and extinguish the fire. Then
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} expounded the doctrine of {%pravṛtti%} and {%nivṛtti.%}
<div n="lb">From his organs of sense ({%gobhyaḥ,%} cf. {%khebhyaḥ%} in a parallel
<div n="lb">passage, XII, 9179) then issued a female who was dark, etc.,
<div n="lb">and set out for the southern quarter; {%Brahmán%} called her
<div n="lb">Death {%(Mṛtyu)%} and told her to slay the creatures. She wept,
<div n="lb">but {%Brahmán%} caught her tears with his two hands and
<div n="lb">implored her (VII, {@53@})—who wished to go to the hermitage
<div n="lb">of {%Dhenuka%} to perform austerities—to slay the creatures.
<div n="lb">Soon {%Brahmán%} smiled, the creatures continued to live as
<div n="lb">before, and {%Mṛtyu%} proceeded to {%Dhenuka,%} where she practised
<div n="lb">austere vows during twenty-one times ten billions of years,
<div n="lb">and then she wandered 10,000 billions of years with the
<div n="lb">creatures. Next she repaired to {%Nandā%} and there passed
<div n="lb">8,000 years, and became purified from all her sins. Then she
<div n="lb">went to {%Kauśikī,%} where she lived upon air and water only.
<div n="lb">Then she repaired to {%Pañcagaṅgā%} and next to {%Vetasaka%} (C. {%Ce°%}),
<div n="lb">then to the {%Gaṅgā%} and thence to {%Meru,%} motionless and
<div n="lb">suspending her life-breaths. Thence to the top of {%Himavat%}
<div n="lb">(where the gods had performed sacrifices) for a billion of
<div n="lb">years standing on the toe only of her feet. Then to
<div n="lb">{%Puṣkara,%} and {%Gokarṇa,%} and {%Naimiṣa,%} and {%Malaya,%} with
<div n="lb">steady devotion to the Grandsire without acknowledging any
<div n="lb">other god. {%Brahmán%} was gratified with her and said that
<div n="lb">in slaying the creatures she should be without sin; {%Yama%} and
<div n="lb">the diseases should become her helpmates. She prevailed
<div n="lb">upon him that the passions, covetousness, etc., should tear
<div n="lb">the bodies of the creatures before she slew them. Her
<div n="lb">tears which were in his hands should become diseases
<div n="lb">springing from the creatures themselves and kill men; she
<div n="lb">should be the virtue of living creatures and the goddess of
<div n="lb">this virtue. Sin would slay those who were of wicked
<div n="lb">behaviour; “it will be thy work to sink them in their sins that
<div n="lb">are wicked.” Nārada further expounded the nature of death
<div n="lb">and told Akampana not to grieve for his dead son: VII,
