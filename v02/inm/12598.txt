[{@Yavakrītopākhyana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Yavakrīta”). § 414 (Tīrthay.). The learned {%Raibhya%} and
<div n="lb">the Ṛṣi {%Bharadvāja%} were friends. {%Raibhya%} had two learned
<div n="lb">sons, {%Arvāvasu%} and {%Parāvasu; Bharadvāja%} only one son,
<div n="lb">{%Yavakrīta.%} As {%Yavakrīta%} saw that {%Raibhya%} and his sons
<div n="lb">were esteemed by the {%brahmans,%} while {%Bharadvāja%} was
<div n="lb">slighted, he practised austerities (exposing himself to a
<div n="lb">blazing fire) in order to acquire Vedic knowledge for himself
<div n="lb">and his father (cf. v. 10817) instead of acquiring it from a
<div n="lb">teacher during a long time. {%Indra%} was alarmed, and twice
<div n="lb">he in vain attempted to make {%Yavakrīta%} desist from his
<div n="lb">penances, saying that they never could be successful. As
<div n="lb">{%Yavakrīta%} declared that he would cut off his limbs and
<div n="lb">sacrifice them in the fire, {%Indra%} assumed the guise of an old
<div n="lb">decrepit brahman, and began to throw up a dam of sand at
<div n="lb">that spot of the {%Bhāgīrathī%} where {%Yavakrīta%} used to bathe,
<div n="lb">and declared that {%Yavakrīta's%} intentions were equally im-
<div n="lb">possible. Then {%Yavakrīta%} desisted from his plan, and {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">granted him that the {%Vedas%} should be revealed to him and
<div n="lb">his father, and that he should excel other men. {%Bharadvāja%}
<div n="lb">said that {%Yavakrīta%} would become proud and uncharitable
<div n="lb">and thence destruction would soon overtake him (§ 415), and
<div n="lb">told him some gāthās, narrated by the gods, about {%Medhāvin%}
<div n="lb">(q.v.).—§ 416. {%Bharadvāja%} made {%Yavakrīta%} promise to shun
<div n="lb">the irritable {%Raibhya%} and his sons, and {%Yavakrīta%} began to
<div n="lb">offend other {%ṛṣis%} (III, {@135@}). Once, in the month of
<div n="lb">{%Mādhava,%} he came to the hermitage of {%Raibhya%} and seduced (?)
<div n="lb">(cf. {%sajjayām āsa,%} var. lect. Nīl., instead of {%majjayām āsa%}) the
<div n="lb">wife of {%Parāvasu.%} When {%Raibhya%} came home and saw what
<div n="lb">had happened, he offered in the fire two matted locks of his
<div n="lb">hair, whence sprang out a woman resembling his daughter-
<div n="lb">in-law, who robbed {%Yavakrīta%} of his water-pot, and a {%Rakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">who flew at him with his uplifted spear, as he had been
<div n="lb">deprived of his water-pot and rendered unclean {%(ucchiṣṭa).%}
<div n="lb">{%Yavakrīta%} fled to a tank and then to all the rivers, and,
<div n="lb">finding them all devoid of water, he attempted to enter into
<div n="lb">the {%agnihotra%} room of his father, but was stopped at the door
<div n="lb">by a blind {%śūdra%} warder, and killed by the {%rakṣas.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Rakṣas,%} with the permission of {%Raibhya,%} began to live with
<div n="lb">the female (III, {@136@}). When {%Bharadvāja%} returned home,
<div n="lb">the sacrificial fires, which used to welcome him every day,
<div n="lb">did not come forward to welcome him. Having heard from
<div n="lb">the {%śūdra%} what had happened, he cursed {%Raibhya,%} saying
<div n="lb">that he should be killed by his eldest son. He cremated
<div n="lb">{%Yavakrīta,%} and then himself entered the fire (III, {@137@}).
<div n="lb">At that time king {%Bṛhaddyumna,%} the {%yājya%} of {%Raibhya,%}
<div n="lb">employed {%Arvāvasu%} and {%Parāvasu%} at a sacrifice, while
<div n="lb">{%Raibhya%} stayed at home with the wife of {%Parāvasu.%} One
<div n="lb">day {%Parāvasu,%} returning home to see his wife, met in the
[Page773-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">darkness his father in the wood wrapped in the skin of a
<div n="lb">black antelope, and, mistaking him for a deer, killed him.
<div n="lb">Then, after having performed the funeral rites of his father,
<div n="lb">he prevailed upon {%Arvāvasu%} to observe the vow prescribed in
<div n="lb">the case of killing a brahman, while he himself conducted
<div n="lb">the sacrifice alone. When {%Arvāvasu%} came back, having
<div n="lb">observed the vow, {%Parāvasu%} caused him to be driven away
<div n="lb">from the sacrifice as a slayer of a brahman. The {%brahmarṣi%}
<div n="lb">{%Arvāvasu%} went to the wood, and, applying to the Sun, he
<div n="lb">practised austerities and mastered the {%Rahasyaveda%} of the
<div n="lb">Sun. The Sun appeared to him in his embodied form, and
<div n="lb">said the gods were pleased by him. They elected {%Arvāvasu%}
<div n="lb">and rejected {%Parāvasu.%} The gods {%Agni,%} etc., granted him the
<div n="lb">boon that {%Raibhya, Bharadvāja,%} and {%Yavakrīta%} revived, that
<div n="lb">{%Parāvasu%} was absolved from his sin, that {%Raibhya%} did not
<div n="lb">recollect his having been slain, and that the {%Saura Veda%}
<div n="lb">should attain celebrity {%(pratiṣṭhāṃ).%} The gods explained to
<div n="lb">{%Yavakrīta%} that {%Raibhya%} had been able to kill him because he
<div n="lb">had acquired his knowledge with great exertion and in the
<div n="lb">course of a long time, while {%Yavakrīta%} had learnt the {%Vedas%}
<div n="lb">without exertion and without a {%guru.%} Then {%Indra%} and the
<div n="lb">gods returned to heaven (III, {@138@}).
