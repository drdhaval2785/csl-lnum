{@Mudgala,@}¦ a ṛṣi. § 391 (Ṛṣyaśṛṅga): III, {@113,@} 10093
<div n="lb">({%Nārāyaṇīvendrasenā,%} i.e. the wife of {%M., babhūva vaśyā nityaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%M°sya%}).—§ 520 (Vrīhidrauṇikap.): III, {@260,@} 15404.—
<div n="lb">§ 520 (cf. Vrīhidrauṇikap.): Vyāsa said: There lived in
<div n="lb">{%Kurukṣetra%} a virtuous sage named {%Mudgala,%} who lived by
<div n="lb">picking up ears of corn and grain, collecting a {%droṇa%} of corn
<div n="lb">during one fortnight and eating it together with his son and
<div n="lb">wife the other fortnight; yet he celebrated the {%sattra%} called
<div n="lb">{%iṣṭīkṛta%} and the {%darśa-%} and {%paurṇamāsa-%}sacrifices, where
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} himself and the gods partook of the food offered, and
<div n="lb">entertained his guests with food, for the remainder of the
<div n="lb">{%droṇa%} of corn increased as soon as a guest appeared, so that
<div n="lb">hundreds of brahmans were fed with it; he lived himself on
<div n="lb">the food that remained after the gods and the guests had
[Page490-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">eaten. Having heard of {%M. Durvāsas,%} naked and frantic,
<div n="lb">came to him uttering insulting words, and during six seasons
<div n="lb">ate up all his food, without perceiving any agitation in {%M.'s%}
<div n="lb">heart. {%Durvāsas%} then told {%M.%} that in reward he should
<div n="lb">go to heaven even in his own body. Immediately a celestial
<div n="lb">messenger {%(devadūta)%} appeared upon a chariot yoked with
<div n="lb">swans and cranes, etc., and invited {%M.%} to ascend it. {%M.%} first
<div n="lb">asked the {%devadūta%} to tell him about the advantages and
<div n="lb">disadvantages of heaven (III, {@260@}). The {%devadūta%} then
<div n="lb">described heaven {%(Svarga)%} (atheists and untruthful persons
<div n="lb">and those who have not practised ascetic austerities and
<div n="lb">those who have not performed great sacrifices cannot repair
<div n="lb">thither), with its advantages: myriads of beautiful worlds
<div n="lb">owned by the gods, the {%Sādhyas,%} the {%Viśve,%} the {%maharṣis,%}
<div n="lb">the {%Yāmas,%} the {%Dhāmas,%} the {%Gandharvas,%} and the {%Apsarases;%}
<div n="lb">{%Meru%} extending over 33,000 yojanas; the gardens of the
<div n="lb">celestials; {%Nandana,%} etc.; no grief, etc., no sweat, stench,
<div n="lb">excreta, nor urine, nor dust; the foremost regions are the
<div n="lb">regions of Brahmán {%(Brāhmaṇāḥ…lokāḥ);%} thither repair
<div n="lb">sanctified {%ṛṣis%} and there dwell the {%Ṛbhus,%} the gods of the
<div n="lb">gods themselves, who suffer no pangs from women, do not
<div n="lb">possess wealth, etc., do not subsist on oblations nor
<div n="lb">{%amṛta,%} and cannot be perceived by the senses, nor do they
<div n="lb">change at the revolution of a {%kalpa;%} for them there is neither
<div n="lb">ecstasy, nor joy, nor happiness, nor misery, etc.; they are
<div n="lb">thirty-three in number, to their regions repair wise men
<div n="lb">after having observed excellent vows, and also {%M.%} had
<div n="lb">acquired that success by his charity. Its disadvantages:
<div n="lb">while reaping the fruit of his acts a person cannot be
<div n="lb">engaged in any others, for this world is one of acts, the
<div n="lb">other one of fruition; after one has entirely exhausted his
<div n="lb">merit, he is subject to fall; he is then stupefied and
<div n="lb">agitated by emotions, and when the garlands of those who
<div n="lb">are to fall fade away, fear invades their hearts; but by reason
<div n="lb">of their merits they take birth among men, and then they
<div n="lb">attain to high fortune and happiness, while, if one cannot
<div n="lb">acquire knowledge here, he comes by an inferior birth. As
<div n="lb">{%M.%} did not desire to go to heaven, but asked a region where
<div n="lb">people have not to lament nor to be pained nor agitated, the
<div n="lb">{%devadūta%} described to him the supreme seat of Viṣṇu, which
<div n="lb">is called the highest {%Bráhman%} and lies above the abode of
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán;%} thither only those who are free from selfishness,
<div n="lb">etc., and those who are given to contemplation and {%yoga,%} can
<div n="lb">repair. Then {%M.%} bade farewell to the {%devadūta,%} and being
<div n="lb">always engaged in meditation, etc., he at last attained to
<div n="lb">that supreme state of perfection {%(jagāma śāśvatāṃ siddhiṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%parāṃ nirvāṇalakṣaṇām).%} “Therefore,” {%Vyāsa%} continued,
<div n="lb">“you also, O son of {%Kuntī,%} ought not to grieve; after the
<div n="lb">thirteenth year you will get back your kingdom.” Having
<div n="lb">said this {%Vyāsa%} returned to his hermitage to practise
<div n="lb">austerities (III, {@261@}): III, {@260,@} 15407, 15415, 15418,
<div n="lb">15420, 15427, 15434; {@261,@} 15443, 15448, 15469, 15476,
<div n="lb">(15481).—§ 677 (Mokṣadh.): XII, {@235,@} 8606 (Śata-
<div n="lb">dyumna went to heaven after having given a mansion to
<div n="lb">{%M.%}).—§ 721{%b%} (Viśvāmitrop.): XIII, {@4<lang n="greek"></lang>,@} 250 (the same?,
<div n="lb">son of Viśvāmitra). Cf. Maudgalya.
