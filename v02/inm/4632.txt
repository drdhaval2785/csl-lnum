[{@Indrajidvadha(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the slaughter of Indrajit”).
<div n="lb">§ 541: Indrajit tied Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in a network of
<div n="lb">those arrows of his which he had obtained as boons. Sugrīva
<div n="lb">and the monkeys Suṣeṇa, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), surrounded them. Vibhī-
<div n="lb">ṣaṇa came and roused them with the Prajñāstra; Sugrīva
<div n="lb">extracted the arrows and applied the medicine {%viśalyā;%} from
<div n="lb">the mountain Śveta a Guhyaka of Kubera's brought water,
<div n="lb">by rubbing one's eyes with which all invisible creatures
<div n="lb">became visible. Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), rubbed
<div n="lb">their eyes. Having informed Rāvaṇa, Indrajit returned
<div n="lb">without having completed his daily sacrifice; receiving a
<div n="lb">hint from Vibhīṣaṇa, Lakṣmaṇa killed Indrajit. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb">would kill Sītā, but was dissuaded by Avindhya (III, {@289@}).
