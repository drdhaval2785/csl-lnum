{@Kaca,@}¦ a brahman, the son of Bṛhaspati. § 145 (Sambhavap.):
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} said: How did {%Yayāti%} get {%Devayānī? Vaiśampā-%}
<div n="lb">{%yana%} related: In the many battles between the gods and the
<div n="lb">{%Asuras,%} the gods had for their purohita {%Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa,%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Asuras Uśanas Kāvya%} (i.e. {%Śukra%}). As {%Uśanas,%} by
<div n="lb">his science {%Sañjīvinī,%} restored the fallen {%Dānavas%} to life, and
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} was unable to revive the fallen gods, the gods
<div n="lb">prevailed upon {%Bṛhaspati's%} son {%Kaca%} to repair to {%Uśanas%}
<div n="lb">and conciliate him and his daughter {%Devayānī%} and learn the
<div n="lb">{%Sañjīvinī. K.%} then repaired to the capital of {%Vṛṣaparvan,%}
<div n="lb">the king of the {%Dānavas,%} and promising to practise {%brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%carya%} for 1,000 years he was accepted by {%Uśanas%} as his
[Page365-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">pupil. Young as he was he, by singing and dancing and
<div n="lb">playing on instruments, etc., soon gratified {%Devayānī.%} After
<div n="lb">500 years the {%Dānavas,%} having discovered who he was, slew
<div n="lb">him, and one time hacked his body to pieces and gave it to
<div n="lb">wolves and jackals, another time they pounded it into paste
<div n="lb">and mixed it with the waters of the ocean, but both times
<div n="lb">{%Devayānī%} prevailed upon {%Uśanas%} to restore {%K.%} to life
<div n="lb">by the {%Sañjīvinī,%} summoning him and saying, “Come.”
<div n="lb">Then slaying him for the third time they burned the body
<div n="lb">and mixed the ashes with the wine {%(surā)%} which {%Uśanas%}
<div n="lb">drank. As {%Devayānī%} again asked her father to revive {%K.,%}
<div n="lb">{%Uśanas%} said: “It is of no use, as he is always killed again;
<div n="lb">thou art always worshipped by the Bráhman (i.e. the Veda,
<div n="lb">Nīl.), the brahmans, the gods including {%Indra,%} the {%Vasus,%}
<div n="lb">the {%Aśvins,%} the enemies of the gods and the whole world,
<div n="lb">therefore do not grieve for a mortal.” As {%Devayānī%} said she
<div n="lb">would starve, {%Śukra%} imparted the {%Sañjīvinī%} to {%K.,%} who, though
<div n="lb">reduced to powder, remembered everything. {%K.%} then came
<div n="lb">out, ripping open the stomach of {%Śukra%} and then revived
<div n="lb">{%Śukra%} by the {%Sañjīvinī. Uśanas%} declared that henceforth that
<div n="lb">brahman who would drink wine should be reckoned to have
<div n="lb">committed the sin of slaying a brahman. {%K.%} stayed with
<div n="lb">{%Śukra%} for 1,000 years (I, {@76@}). When {%K.%} was about to return
<div n="lb">to the gods {%Devayānī%} asked him to become her husband, and
<div n="lb">as he refused (saying that she was a sister to him) she cursed
<div n="lb">him, saying that his science should bear no fruit. {%K.%} again
<div n="lb">cursed {%Devayānī,%} saying that no ṛṣi's son should take her
<div n="lb">hand, and that his science should bear fruit, if not to himself,
<div n="lb">at least to him to whom he might impart it. Then he went to
<div n="lb">the abode of {%Indra,%} and the gods declared that he should become
<div n="lb">a sharer with them in sacrificial offerings (I, {@77@}): I, {@76,@}
