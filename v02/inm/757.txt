[{@Āraṇeyaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the wood for
<div n="lb">producing fire by friction,” the 51st of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr. = ch. III, {@311—315@}). § 548: Asked by Janamejaya,
<div n="lb">Vaiśampāyana related what the Pāṇḍavas did after having
<div n="lb">rescued Kṛṣṇā (from Jayadratha). The Pāṇḍavas left
<div n="lb">Kāmyaka and returned to Dvaitavana with Kṛṣṇā. Once
<div n="lb">a deer carried off a brahman's araṇī and mantha, was pursued
<div n="lb">by the Pāṇḍavas, and suddenly became invisible. Bhīma
<div n="lb">repented that he had not slain the prātikāmin, Arjuna that he
<div n="lb">had not slain Karṇa, and Sahadeva that he had not slain
<div n="lb">Śakuni. Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, and Bhīma were suc-
<div n="lb">cessively sent to fetch water, but caused to drop down dead
<div n="lb">by a Yakṣa. At last Yudhiṣṭhira himself went, answered
<div n="lb">thirty-four questions put by the Yakṣa, chose that Nakula
<div n="lb">should be revived, rescued all his brothers, learnt that the
<div n="lb">Yakṣa was his father Dharma {%(c),%} was granted the boon that
<div n="lb">the brahman would recover his araṇī and mantha, that the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas would manage to live the thirteenth year un-
<div n="lb">recognized in Virāṭa's kingdom, and that Yudhiṣṭhira (who
<div n="lb">was born of Dharma, as Vidura of a portion of Dharma)
<div n="lb">should overcome covetousness, etc. The Pāṇḍavas asked
<div n="lb">permission of the brahmans to live the thirteenth year in
<div n="lb">concealment from the Dhārtarāṣṭras, Duryodhana, etc., and
<div n="lb">Karṇa and Saubala. Dhaumya, etc., consoled Yudhiṣṭhira:
<div n="lb">“Even the gods (Indra, {%d;%} Viṣṇu, {%e;%} Agni, {%f;%} Aurva, {%g;%}
<div n="lb">Vivasvat, {%h%}) have wandered in disguise for the purpose of
<div n="lb">overcoming foes.” The brahmans (yatis, munis) went back
<div n="lb">to their homes, and the Pāṇḍavas and Dhaumya set out with
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇā, and the next day proceeded for a krośa, and then sat
<div n="lb">down in order to take counsel of each other.
