{@[Draupadī-Satyabhāmā-saṃvādaparvan]@}¦ (“con-
<div n="lb">versation between Draupadī and Satyabhāmā,” the 42nd
<div n="lb">of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 510: After the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} had taken their seats, {%Draupadī%} and
<div n="lb">{%Satyabhāmā Sātrājitī,%} the favourite wife of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} entered
<div n="lb">the hermitage. {%Satyabhāmā%} asked {%Draupadī%} how she made
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} obedient to her, in order that she herself
<div n="lb">might by the same means secure the affection of {%Kṛṣṇa.%}
[Page262-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} warned her against using drugs, incantations, etc.,
<div n="lb">which were used by wicked women, and said that she
<div n="lb">kept aloof from vanity and served the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
<div n="lb">devotion, etc. Formerly, in the palace of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at
<div n="lb">{%Indraprastha,%} food was daily given to 8,000 {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">80,000 {%snātakas%} with thirty serving-maids assigned to each,
<div n="lb">10,000 {%yatis;%} he had 100,000 well-dressed serving-maids
<div n="lb">with bracelets, etc., all skilled in singing and dancing;
<div n="lb">100,000 maidservants who day and night used to feed
<div n="lb">guests; 100,000 horses, and 100,000 elephants. And it
<div n="lb">was {%Draupadī%} who had the supervision of all this; she knew
<div n="lb">the names and features of all the girls, and knew everything
<div n="lb">about them, and even about the cowherds and shepherds. She
<div n="lb">alone knew the income and expenditure of the king and what
<div n="lb">their whole wealth was, bearing hunger and thirst, and
<div n="lb">being the first to wake up and the last to go to bed (III,
<div n="lb">{@233@}). {%Draupadī%} said that for women there is no god equal
<div n="lb">to the husband, as it is from him the wife obtains offspring,
<div n="lb">articles of enjoyment, fame, and heaven itself hereafter. In
<div n="lb">order to attract the heart of {%Kṛṣṇa, Satyabhāmā%} ought to
<div n="lb">let him understand that she adored him with all her heart
<div n="lb">by promptly, when she saw him enter her chamber, offering
<div n="lb">him a seat and water to wash his feet; and even if he ordered
<div n="lb">a maidservant to do anything, she ought to get up and do it
<div n="lb">herself; not to blab of whatever he should speak before her;
<div n="lb">feed those that were dear to him, and keep herself aloof from
<div n="lb">those that were hostile to him; not to stay or converse in
<div n="lb">private even with her sons {%Pradyumna%} and {%Śāmba;%} and
<div n="lb">shun wicked women (III, {@234@}).—§ 511: Then {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">bade farewell to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and to {%Mārkaṇḍeya,%} etc., and
<div n="lb">called for {%Satyabhāmā. Satyabhāmā%} comforted {%Draupadī,%}
<div n="lb">saying that she would soon recover her ancient happiness,
<div n="lb">and relating of {%Prativindhya, Śrutasoma,%} and {%Śrutakarman%}
<div n="lb">(her son by {%Arjuna%}), and {%Śatānīka%} (her son by {%Nakula%}), and
<div n="lb">{%Śrutasena%} (her son by {%Sahadeva%}), that they were well and
<div n="lb">skilled in weapons and, like {%Abhimanyu,%} delighted with
<div n="lb">staying at {%Dvāravatī,%} and were loved by {%Subhadrā, Pradyumna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} with his son {%Bhānu,%} etc., and her mother-in-law,
<div n="lb">and all the {%Andhakas%} and {%Vṛṣṇis,%} with {%Rāma,%} etc. Then
<div n="lb">{%Satyabhāmā%} mounted the chariot of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and they set out
<div n="lb">for his city (III, {@235@}).
