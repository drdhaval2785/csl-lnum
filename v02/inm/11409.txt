[{@Vaivāhikaparvan@}<sup>2</sup>]¦ (“the section containing the mar-
<div n="lb">riage of Abhimanyu and Uttarā”; the 56th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr.). § 553. On the third day the five
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} attired in white robes after a bath, etc., entered
<div n="lb">the palace of {%Virāṭa%} and took their seats on the thrones
<div n="lb">reserved for kings. {%Virāṭa%} rebuked {%Kaṅka (Yudhiṣṭhira)%}
<div n="lb">for this insolence; {%Arjuna%} praised {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} saying that
<div n="lb">there was none like him, even amongst D., As., men, Rā., G.,
<div n="lb">Y., Ku., or M.-U., and disclosed that he was {%Yudhiṣṭhira (b)%}
<div n="lb">(IV, {@70@}). Asked by {%Virāṭa%} which of them then was {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">etc., {%Arjuna%} pointed out {%Bhīma%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Nakula,%} and {%Sahadeva%}
<div n="lb">(both beautiful and great warriors), {%Draupadī,%} and himself.
<div n="lb">{%Uttara%} spoke of {%Arjuna's%} prowess, and described each of them,
<div n="lb">especially {%Arjuna%} (“it was by him that {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} were vanquished”). {%Virāṭa,%} thinking he had
<div n="lb">offended {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} offered to bestow his daughter {%Uttarā%}
<div n="lb">on {%Arjuna,%} which was applauded by {%Uttara,%} and offered his
<div n="lb">whole kingdom, etc., to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna%} accepted
[Page704-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Uttarā%} as his daughter-in-law, saying that such an alliance
<div n="lb">between the {%Matsyas%} and the {%Bharatas%} was desirable (IV, {@71@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Virāṭa%} why he himself did not wish to accept his
<div n="lb">daughter as wife, {%Arjuna%} alleged that she had confided in
<div n="lb">him as her father, and people might entertain suspicions
<div n="lb">against her or him; by accepting her for {%Abhimanyu%} he
<div n="lb">attested her purity. {%Virāṭa%} approved of it, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">gave his assent; the latter sent invitations to {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">and so did {%Virāṭa.%} The {%Pāṇḍavas%} took up their abode at
<div n="lb">{%Upaplavya. Arjuna%} brought over {%Abhimanyu%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">and many {%Daśārhas%} from the {%Ānartta%} country. The {%Kāśi%}-
<div n="lb">king and {%Śaibya%} (friendly to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}) came, each accom-
<div n="lb">panied by an {%akṣauhiṇī%} of troops; {%Yajñasena%} came there
<div n="lb">with the sons of {%Draupadī%} and {%Śikhaṇḍin,%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">came with an {%akṣauhiṇī.%} All the kings that came there
<div n="lb">were lords of {%akṣauhiṇīs%} and performers of sacrifices, etc.
<div n="lb">Then came {%Kṛṣṇa%} (decked with garlands), {%Balarāma,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">with {%Abhimanyu%} and his mother. And {%Indrasena,%} etc., having
<div n="lb">lived at {%Dvārakā%} for a whole year, came with the chariots of
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas.%} In the train of {%Kṛṣṇa%} came also 10,000
<div n="lb">elephants, 100 thousands of horses, 100 millions of chariots,
<div n="lb">100 milliards of foot soldiers, and innumerable {%Vṛṣṇi,%}
<div n="lb">{%Andhaka,%} and {%Bhoja%} warriors. {%Kṛṣṇa%} gave to each of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} numerous female slaves, etc. Then the nuptial
<div n="lb">festival set in (description). The matrons of the {%Matsyas%}
<div n="lb">were headed by {%Sudeṣṇā;%} but {%Kṛṣṇā%} was the foremost in
<div n="lb">beauty, etc. {%Virāṭa%} gave [as dowry] 7,000 horses and 200
<div n="lb">elephants, and much wealth, and offered his kingdom, etc.,
<div n="lb">to the {%Pāṇḍavas. Yudhiṣṭhira%} gave all the wealth that
<div n="lb">had been brought by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc., to the brahmans (IV, {@72@}).
