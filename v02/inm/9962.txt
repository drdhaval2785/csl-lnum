[{@Skandayuddha(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the combat of Skanda”). § 503
<div n="lb">(cf. Manuṣyagr.). Then {%Svāhā,%} the daughter of {%Dakṣa,%}
<div n="lb">who had in vain loved {%Agni%} from her childhood, prevailed
<div n="lb">upon {%Skanda%} that she should live for ever with {%Agni,%} in so far
<div n="lb">as offerings with {%mantras%} to the gods and {%pitṛs (havyaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%kavyañ ca)%} should always be coupled with the name of {%Svāhā.%}
<div n="lb">—§ 504. Then {%Skanda%} was sent by {%Brahmán%} to his father
<div n="lb">{%Rudra;%} for {%Rudra%} and {%Umā%} had entered {%Agni%} and {%Svāhā,%}
<div n="lb">and from this combination {%Skanda%} had sprung; {%Rudra's%}
<div n="lb">semen had been thrown back upon the hill, whence sprang
<div n="lb">forth {%Miñjikā%} and {%Miñjika,%} and portions of it fell into the
<div n="lb">Blood Sea, into the rays of the sun, upon the earth, and upon
<div n="lb">the trees, whence sprang forth the various troops of his
<div n="lb">{%pāriṣadas,%} living on flesh. These five classes of spirits
<div n="lb">should be honoured with sun-flowers ({%arkapuṣpaiḥ:%} Calotropis
<div n="lb">gigantea) for the sake of wealth and healing of diseases;
<div n="lb">{%Miñjikā%} and {%Miñjika%} must be honoured for the welfare of
<div n="lb">children; the females, named {%Vṛddhikās,%} who were produced
<div n="lb">in the trees and live on human flesh, must be worshipped by
<div n="lb">persons who desire to have children. These are the innu-
<div n="lb">merable {%gaṇas%} of {%Piśācas.%}—§ 505. {%Airāvata%} had two bells
<div n="lb">named {%Vaijayantī; Indra%} gave one of them to {%Viśākha%} and
<div n="lb">the other one to {%Skanda;%} the standards of {%Skanda%} and {%Viśākha%}
<div n="lb">were red. {%Skanda,%} surrounded by troops of {%Piśācas%} and gods,
<div n="lb">sat on the golden mountain with the toys that had been given
<div n="lb">to him by the gods. Description of the {%Śveta%} mountain.—
<div n="lb">§ 506. Then {%Śiva,%} with {%Pārvatī,%} rode in their shining
<div n="lb">chariot, yoked with 1,000 lions and managed by {%Kāla,%} to
<div n="lb">{%Bhadravaṭa;%} they were preceded by {%Kubera%} (riding in
<div n="lb">{%Puṣpaka%}) with the {%Guhyakas,%} and followed by {%Indra%} (riding
<div n="lb">on {%Airāvata%}) and the gods; in the right wing of his army
<div n="lb">was the great {%Yakṣa Amogha,%} with the {%Jṛmbhakas, Yakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Rakṣases, Vasus, Rudras,%} etc.; there was also {%Yama,%} with
<div n="lb">{%Mṛtyu,%} surrounded by hundreds of terrible diseases; behind
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} the trident of {%Śiva,%} named {%Vijaya,%} surrounded by
<div n="lb">{%Varuṇa,%} with various aquatic animals; the {%paṭṭiśa%} of {%Rudra%}
<div n="lb">surrounded by clubs, etc., and followed by the umbrella of
<div n="lb">{%Rudra,%} and after this the water-vessel, worshipped by the
<div n="lb">troops and maharṣis, and on the right side of this the
<div n="lb">sceptre {%(daṇḍaḥ),%} with {%Bhṛgus, Aṅgirases,%} and gods. Behind
<div n="lb">these rode {%Rudra%} in his white chariot, followed by rivers, etc.;
<div n="lb">{%Apsarases, nakṣatras,%} planets, the children of the gods, etc.,
<div n="lb">and {%Parjanya. Soma%} held a white umbrella over his head,
<div n="lb">and {%Agni%} and {%Vāyu%} held the two fans. Behind him came
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} and the {%rājarṣis,%} and {%Gaurī, Vidyā,%} etc., and the
[Page643-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">sciences {%(vidyāgaṇāḥ).%} In the front the {%Rākṣasa graha%}
<div n="lb">advanced, holding the standard. The foremost of {%Yakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Piṅgala,%} the friend of {%Rudra,%} who is always busy in places
<div n="lb">where corpses are burned, at one time was ahead of the army
<div n="lb">and at another behind it. {%Rudra%} is worshipped by mortals
<div n="lb">with virtuous actions in various forms. At the request of
<div n="lb">{%Śiva, Skanda%} took the command of the seventh army corps
<div n="lb">{%(skandhasya)%} and was advised always to look up to {%Śiva,%} then
<div n="lb">he should attain great welfare.—§ 507. Omens frightened
<div n="lb">{%Śiva, Pārvatī,%} the gods, and the {%Dānavas (Asuras, Daityas);%}
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} encouraged the gods when about to flee; the {%Dānava%}
<div n="lb">{%Mahiṣa%} crushed 10,000 of the gods with a mountain, put
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} and the gods to flight, and seized the pole of {%Rudra's%}
<div n="lb">chariot, while heaven and earth groaned, etc., and the
<div n="lb">{%maharṣis%} lost their senses, but (as {%Rudra%} did not choose to
<div n="lb">kill him himself) {%Skanda%} killed him, cutting off his head that
<div n="lb">barred the entrance of sixteen {%yojanas%} [to the {%Uttara-Kurus,%}
<div n="lb">Nīl.], though the {%Uttara-Kurus%} at present pass easily by that
<div n="lb">gate. The {%Dānavas%} fell in large numbers from the lance and
<div n="lb">arrows of {%Skanda;%} the lance always returned to his hand
<div n="lb">again after killing thousands of enemies; the {%pāriṣadas%} of
<div n="lb">{%Skanda%} devoured them and drank their blood. When the
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas%} were defeated, {%Skanda%} went to {%Śiva%} and was embraced
<div n="lb">and praised by {%Indra.%} Then {%Indra,%} with the gods, took
<div n="lb">leave from {%Śiva%} and left the place, and {%Rudra%} returned to
<div n="lb">{%Bhadravaṭa,%} after having recommended to the gods to render
<div n="lb">allegiance to {%Skanda%} just as to himself. In one day {%Skanda%}
<div n="lb">had killed the {%Dānavas%} and conqucred the three worlds*
