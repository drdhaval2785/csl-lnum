[{@Haraṇāharaṇaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">handing over the gift of honour,” the 17th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of the Mhbhr.). § 253: {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">had not insulted their family, but had rather enhanced their
<div n="lb">respect, and prevailed upon them that they, by conciliation,
<div n="lb">brought {%Arjuna%} back to {%Dvārakā,%} where he was united in
<div n="lb">marriage with {%Subhadrā%} and passed a whole year. The last
<div n="lb">time of his exile he passed in {%Puṣkara.%} After the twelve
<div n="lb">years were complete he came back to {%Khāṇḍavaprastha.%}
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} at first was jealous, but then embraced {%Subhadrā.%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} visited them at {%Indraprastha%} with {%Rāma, Akrūra%}
<div n="lb">{%Dānapati%} (the {%senāpati%} of the {%Vṛṣṇis%}), {%Anādhṛṣṭi, Uddhava%}
<div n="lb">(a disciple of {%Bṛhaspati%} himself), {%Satyaka%} and {%Sātyaki,%} and

<div n="lb">{%Cārudeṣṇa, Jhillin, Vipṛthu, Sāraṇa, Gada,%} etc., bringing
<div n="lb">with them many nuptial presents. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent the
<div n="lb">twins out to receive them. {%Kṛṣṇa%} gave them 10,000 kine
<div n="lb">from the country of {%Mathurā,%} and {%Bālhika%} horses as {%kanyādhana,%}
<div n="lb">etc. {%Rāma%} gave {%Arjuna%} as a wedding present {%(pāṇigrahaṇika)%}
<div n="lb">1,000 elephants. Having spent many days in sports and
<div n="lb">merriment there, the {%Vṛṣṇis%} returned to {%Dvāravatī%} with
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} in the van, carrying with them the gems that had been
<div n="lb">given them by {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} But {%Kṛṣṇa%} remained with
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} at {%Indrapraṣtha,%} and they went a-hunting over the
<div n="lb">borders of the {%Yamunā. Subhadrā%} brought forth {%Abhimanyu,%} so
<div n="lb">called because he was fearless {%(abhī)%} and wrathful ({%manyumat,%}
<div n="lb">v. 8027). Upon his birth {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} gave away 10,000
<div n="lb">kine and {%niṣkas%} to the {%brahmans.%} The child became the
<div n="lb">favourite of {%Vāsudeva,%} etc., and acquired from his father the
<div n="lb">{%Dhanurveda (b).—Pāñcalī%} ({%Kṛṣṇā,%} v. 8045) also obtained
<div n="lb">five sons (see § 159): {%Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Śrutakarman,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śatānīka, Śrutasena.%} They were born each at the interval of
<div n="lb">one year. Their {%jātakarman, cūḍa,%} and {%upanayana%} were
<div n="lb">performed by {%Dhaumya.%} After having studied the {%Vedas%} they
<div n="lb">acquired from {%Arjuna%} knowledge of all weapons celestial and
<div n="lb">human (I, {@221@}).
