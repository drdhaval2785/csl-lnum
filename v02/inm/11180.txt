<div n="lb">§ 717{%c%} (Nārāyaṇīya): {%Bhīṣma%} said: There was, in times
<div n="lb">past, a king named {%U.,%} the friend of {%Indra,%} and devoted to
<div n="lb">{%Hari Nārāyaṇa;%} he won the sovereignty of the world in
<div n="lb">consequence of a boon he had obtained from {%Nārāyaṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">used to worship him with the {%Sātvata%} ritual ({%Sāttvatānāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcarātrāṇāṃ hitaṃ,%} Nīl.), revealed in days of yore by {%Sūrya%}
<div n="lb">himself, etc. {%Indra%} gave him a share in his own seat and
<div n="lb">bed. The foremost of those conversant with the {%Pāñcarātra%}
<div n="lb">{%(Pāñcarātravidaḥ)%} dwelled in his palaces. The seven ṛṣis
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), named the {%Citraśikhaṇḍins,%} uniting together, had on
<div n="lb">{%Meru%} promulgated an excellent treatise on duties; they were
<div n="lb">the seven {%prakṛtis%} (i.e. {%mahat, ahaṅkāra,%} etc., Nīl.), and
<div n="lb">{%[Manu] Svāyambhuva%} was the eighth (i.e. original Prakṛti,
<div n="lb">Nīl.); they composed that treatise after having worshipped
<div n="lb">with penances {%Hari Nārāyaṇa%} for 1,000 celestial years,
<div n="lb">together with many other ṛṣis; {%Nārāyaṇa%} ordered {%Sarasvatī%}
<div n="lb">to enter into the persons of these ṛṣis and became highly
<div n="lb">pleased with the treatise, which was in accordance with the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Nārāyaṇa%} said: “According to the authority
<div n="lb">of the scriptures I have created {%Brahmán%} from grace, {%Rudra%}
<div n="lb">from my wrath, and yourselves as representing the {%prakṛti-%}
<div n="lb">elements. {%Sūrya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) live and act in their respective
<div n="lb">spheres; guided by your treatise {%Manu Svāyambhuva%} will
<div n="lb">declare the duties to the world, and so will {%Uśanas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati,%} when they will arise; then this science will be
<div n="lb">acquired by king {%Vasu [Uparicara]%} from {%Bṛhaspati;%} upon
<div n="lb">the death of that king this eternal treatise will disappear from
<div n="lb">the world.” Then {%Nārāyaṇa%} disappeared. Subsequently,
<div n="lb">when {%Bṛhaspati%} was born in the {%Aṅgiras%} race in the {%Kṛta%} age,
<div n="lb">those seven ṛṣis charged him with the task of promulgating
<div n="lb">their treatise, which was consistent with the {%Upaniṣads%} and
<div n="lb">the branches of the {%Vedas.%} Then they proceeded to the place
<div n="lb">they chose for practising penances (XII, {@336@}). Etymology of
<div n="lb">the name {%Bṛhaspati.%} King {%Vasu Uparicara%} became the fore-
<div n="lb">most of {%Bṛhaspati's%} disciples, and studied at his feet that
<div n="lb">science of the {%Citraśikhaṇḍins.%} In his horse-sacrifice {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">became the {%hotṛ,%} the sons of {%Prajāpati,%} viz. {%Ekata, Dvita,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Trita,%} the {%sadasyas,%} together with {%Dhanuṣa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); no
<div n="lb">animals were slain in it; {%Hari%} became gratified and came and
<div n="lb">took his share, visible to {%Vasu,%} but invisible to the others. At
<div n="lb">this {%Bṛhaspati%} became angry and hurled the sacrificial ladle
<div n="lb">with violence into the skies, saying: “Here I place this as
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa's%} share, he shall take it before my eyes.” {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} asked why {%Hari%} only took his share invisibly. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">answered: King {%Vasu%} and his {%sadasyas%} sought to pacify {%Bṛhas-%}
<div n="lb">{%pati,%} saying that none should feel anger in this {%Kṛta%} age, as
<div n="lb">{%Hari%} himself did not feel anger, and none could see him save
<div n="lb">he to whom he became gracious. Then the ṛṣis, {%Ekata, Dvita,%}
[Page693-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and {%Trita%} (the mindborn sons of Brahmán) narrated that
<div n="lb">they had once undergone penances for thousands of years,
<div n="lb">to the north of Meru and on the shores of the milky
<div n="lb">ocean in order to behold {%Nārāyaṇa%} in his own form, then
<div n="lb">an incorporeal voice directed them to {%Śvetadvīpa%} on the
<div n="lb">northern shore of the milky ocean; the inhabitants there
<div n="lb">are devoted to {%Nārāyaṇa,%} etc. (description) and adore only
<div n="lb">one god: Arrived there they could see nothing, blinded
<div n="lb">by the splendour of the deity; they then, once more, set
<div n="lb">themselves to practise austerities for 100 years, then they
<div n="lb">beheld the inhabitants (description, they are conversant with
<div n="lb">the ordinances of the {%Pāñcarātra%}). An incorporeal being
<div n="lb">addressed them from the sky, saying that the god could only
<div n="lb">be seen by these white men, etc.: “do ye return, after the
<div n="lb">expiration of this {%Kṛta%} age when the {%Tretā%} age comes (in the
<div n="lb">{%Vaivasvata manvantara%}) a great calamity will overtake the
<div n="lb">worlds, you shall then have to become the allies of the gods.”
<div n="lb">Then {%Ekata,%} etc., returned. Hearing this {%Bṛhaspati%} brought
<div n="lb">the sacrifice to completion. King {%U.%} ruled his subjects
<div n="lb">righteously, and at last, giving up his body, ascended to
<div n="lb">heaven. After some time he, through the curse of the
<div n="lb">brahmans, fell down and sank deep into the earth; but even
<div n="lb">then he, by reciting sacred mantras having {%Nārāyaṇa%} for
<div n="lb">their deity, once more ascended to heaven through the grace
<div n="lb">of {%Nārāyaṇa%} (XII, {@337@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked why king
<div n="lb">{%Vasu,%} who was so devoted to {%Nārāyaṇa,%} did fall from heaven
<div n="lb">and sink beneath the surface of the earth. {%Bhīṣma%} cited
<div n="lb">the old narrative of a discourse between the ṛṣis and the
<div n="lb">gods. The gods once said to some brahmans that sacrifices
<div n="lb">should be performed by offering goats {%(aja).%} The ṛṣis
<div n="lb">declared that, according to a {%Vedic śruti,%} by {%aja%} was to be
<div n="lb">understood seeds; “how can animals be slain in the {%Kṛta%}
<div n="lb">age?” {%Vasu%} was coming through the skies with his troops,
<div n="lb">etc., and was asked to be their judge. Having first ascer-
<div n="lb">tained what opinion was entertained by each of them, {%Vasu,%}
<div n="lb">moved by partiality for the gods, said that sacrifices should be
<div n="lb">performed with animals. The {%ṛṣis%} became very angry, and
<div n="lb">cursed him to fall down from heaven and sink below the
<div n="lb">surface of the earth. He immediately fell, but at the
<div n="lb">command of {%Nārāyaṇa, Vasu's%} memory did not leave him.
<div n="lb">The gods came to his hole and said that he should have the
<div n="lb">{%vasor-dhārā%} (v. the note of PCR., p. 758) for his sustenance
<div n="lb">as long as he remained there. Then the gods and the {%ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">went away. {%Vasu%} began to adore {%Hari%} and to recite in
<div n="lb">silence those sacred mantras which had come out of {%Nārāyaṇa's%}
<div n="lb">mouth in days of yore, and worshipped him in the five sacrifices
<div n="lb">which are performed five times every day. {%Hari Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%(Viṣṇu)%} then let {%Garuḍa%} take {%Vasu%} to {%Brahmaloka%} (XII,
<div n="lb">{@338@}): XII, {@336,@} 12712 {%(rājo°ḥ);%} {@337,@} 12754 {%(rājo°o%}
<div n="lb">{%Vasuḥ),%} 12766; {@338,@} 12834 {%(rājo°ḥ),%} 12838 {%(rājo°ṃ(!)),%}
