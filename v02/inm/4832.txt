{@[Jaṭāsuravadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the section treating of the
<div n="lb">killing of Jaṭāsura,” being the 37th of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.). (Cf. Jaṭāsuravadha.) § 435: One day, after the
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas%} with {%Ghaṭotkaca%} had departed, while {%Bhīma%} was
[Page356-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">a-hunting, and {%Lomaśa%} and the other ṛṣis had gone away to
<div n="lb">bathe and collect flowers, the {%Rākṣasa Jaṭāsura,%} who had
<div n="lb">followed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in the guise of a brahman versed in all
<div n="lb">the {%śāstras,%} with the object of possessing himself of the arms
<div n="lb">of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and of {%Draupadī,%} began to flee away with
<div n="lb">the arms and {%Draupadī%} and the three {%Pāṇḍavas. Sahadeva%}
<div n="lb">extricated himself, and snatching the sword {%Kauśika,%} he
<div n="lb">began to call {%Bhīmasena. Yudhiṣṭhira%} reproached him,
<div n="lb">saying that the {%Rākṣasas%} are the root of virtue and know
<div n="lb">virtue {%(dharmaṃ)%} best, and that the {%Rākṣasas,%} gods, {%Pitṛs,%}
<div n="lb">{%Siddhas, Ṛṣis, Gandharvas,%} etc., depend for their lives on
<div n="lb">men, etc. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then made himself ponderous.
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva%} was about to attack the {%Rākṣasa,%} when {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">appeared mace in hand. The {%Rākṣasa%} set them down, and
<div n="lb">he and {%Bhīma%} began to fight with trees, like {%Vālin%} and
<div n="lb">{%Sugrīva,%} and then with rocks, and at last by wrestling, till
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma,%} having dealt a blow on the neck of the {%Rākṣasa,%}
<div n="lb">lifted him up, and dashed him on the ground and severed
<div n="lb">his head from his body, and then presented himself before
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (III, {@157@}).
