{@Ṛṣyaśṛṅga@}¦ (B. {%Ṛśya°%}), a muni, son of Vibhāṇḍaka. § 11
<div n="lb">(Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2,@} 443 ({%°sya caritraṃ,%} cf. § 391).—§ 270
<div n="lb">(Brahmasabhāv.): II, {@11,@} 440 (in the palace of Brahmán).—
<div n="lb">§ 390{%d%} (Tīrthayātrāp.): {%Ṛ.,%} the son of {%Kāśyapa%} (i.e. Vibhāṇ-
<div n="lb">ḍaka) born by a hind, caused {%Indra%} to rain during a drought
<div n="lb">in the territory of Lomapāda, who gave him his daughter
<div n="lb">Śāntā: III, {@110,@} 9991.—§ 391 (do.): III, {@110,@} 9994.—§ 391
<div n="lb">(cf. do.). The {%viprarṣi Vibhāṇḍaka Kāśyapa%} practising
<div n="lb">austerities near a great lake saw the {%Apsaras Urvaśī,%} whence
<div n="lb">his semen fell into the water and was lapped up by a hind, that
<div n="lb">was drinking. That hind was a daughter of the gods {%(deva-%}
<div n="lb">{%kanyā).%} Brahmán had transformed her into a hind, and when
<div n="lb">she had given birth to a {%muni%} she would be freed. She now
<div n="lb">gave birth to a son, who was named {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga,%} because there
<div n="lb">was a horn on his head. He passed his days in the forest,
<div n="lb">devoted to brahmacarya, and he had never seen any human
<div n="lb">being except his father. At that time the king of the {%Aṅgas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Lomāpāda,%} a friend of {%Daśaratha,%} had been shunned by the
<div n="lb">brahmans and was without a {%purohita,%} because he had been
[Page601-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">guilty of falsehood towards a brahman and therefore {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">did not give rain in his territory. At the advice of a wise
<div n="lb">brahman he did atonement for his sins and appeased the
<div n="lb">brahmans. Thereafter he assembled his ministers in order to
<div n="lb">discuss means for bringing {%Ṛ.%} to his land. According to
<div n="lb">their counsel a courtezan with a number of women, etc.,
<div n="lb">was sent to {%Ṛ.%} (III, {@110@}). She had constructed a floating
<div n="lb">hermitage which she moored at a short distance from {%Vibhāṇ-%}
<div n="lb">{%ḍaka's%} hermitage, and then sent her daughter, a courtezan, to
<div n="lb">Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. She refused the fruits, foot-washing, etc.,
<div n="lb">saying that her religious vows consisted in not receiving such
<div n="lb">things, but implied that she might embrace him. By giving
<div n="lb">him unsuitable food, garlands, beautiful garments, and
<div n="lb">drinks, and by playing and clasping him in her arms, she
<div n="lb">made him overpowered with love, and as she went away under
<div n="lb">the pretext of performing the {%agnihotra,%} he became sad.
<div n="lb">When Vibhāṇḍaka {%(b)%} returned he wondered that {%Ṛ.%} was not
<div n="lb">splitting the logs for fuel, etc., and asked who had been there
<div n="lb">(III, {@111@}). {%Ṛ.%} said that a religious student {%(brahmacārin)%}
<div n="lb">had come to him; he had a mass of hair {%(jaṭilaḥ)%} and a pair
<div n="lb">of ornaments upon his wrist like his rosary {%(akṣamālā);%} his
<div n="lb">matted hair {%(jaṭāḥ)%} was neatly tied up and adhered to the
<div n="lb">forehead and was divided in two, etc. He {%(Ṛ.)%} wished to
<div n="lb">go to him and see him every day (III, {@112@}). {%Vibhāṇḍaka%}
<div n="lb">declared that it was a {%Rākṣasa,%} and in vain spent three days
<div n="lb">in searching for this one. When Vibhāṇḍaka had gone out
<div n="lb">to collect fruits the courtezans allured {%Ṛ.%} to enter the
<div n="lb">bark, which they unmoored, and in this way they brought
<div n="lb">him to {%Lomapāda,%} who prepared a beautiful forest named
<div n="lb">{%Nāvyāśrama%} (“Floating hermitage”) and kept {%Ṛ.%} in the
<div n="lb">female apartments. Suddenly rain poured down. Lomapāda
<div n="lb">gave his daughter {%Śāntā%} to {%Ṛ.%} When {%Vibhāṇḍaka%} was
<div n="lb">going to {%Campā%} in order to burn the king, the city, and his
<div n="lb">whole territory, the king let kine be placed and fields ploughed
<div n="lb">along the road, and ordered the cowherds to honour {%Vibhāṇ-%}
<div n="lb">{%ḍaka%} with hospitality when he was fatigued and hungry, and
<div n="lb">to say that all this belonged to his son and that they were his
<div n="lb">slaves. Thus {%Vibhāṇḍaka%} was appeased. According to the
<div n="lb">command of his father {%Ṛ.,%} as soon as a son had been born to
<div n="lb">him, returned to his father in the wood, and {%Śāntā%} followed
<div n="lb">and obeyed him, as {%Indrasenā Nārāyaṇī%} was ever obedient to
<div n="lb">{%Mudgala,%} etc. (III, {@113@}): III, {@110,@} 9999, 10000, 10006,
