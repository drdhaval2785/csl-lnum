[{@Jāpakopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode about the reciter
<div n="lb">of sacred mantras”). § 662{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): A brahman, who
<div n="lb">was a reciter, conversant with the six {%Aṅgas,%} of the {%Kuśika%}
<div n="lb">race and son of {%Pippalāda,%} acquired spiritual insight into the
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgas;%} at the foot of {%Himavat%} he was devoted to the {%Vedas;%}
<div n="lb">silently reciting {%Gāyatrī,%} he practised austerities for 1,000
<div n="lb">years in order to attain to {%Bráhman.%} Then {%Gāyatrī (Sāvitrī)%}
<div n="lb">appeared and granted him the boon that his wish for recitation
<div n="lb">should go on increasing, and his absorption into meditation
<div n="lb">{%(samādhi)%} be more complete. She added that he should not
<div n="lb">have to go to hell, thither where great brahmans go, but to
<div n="lb">the region of {%Brahmán,%} and that {%Dharma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would come
<div n="lb">to him in person. He continued engaged in recitation for
<div n="lb">1,000 celestial years. Then {%Dharma%} came to him and told
<div n="lb">him to cast off his body in order to win regions of bliss;
<div n="lb">but he did not wish to reside in heaven except with his
<div n="lb">body, but only took pleasure in recitation. {%Time, Mṛtyu,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} came and told him the same. The brahman gave them
<div n="lb">{%arghya%} and {%pādya. Ikṣvāku,%} who had set out on a {%tīrtha-%}
<div n="lb">{%yātrā,%} came and was given {%arghya%} and {%pādya.%} The brahman
<div n="lb">wished to give him something; {%Ikṣvāku,%} as a kṣatriya, would
<div n="lb">not take anything except battle, but only himself give; at last,
<div n="lb">however, he asked to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the
<div n="lb">brahman's recitations, but when the brahman consented he
<div n="lb">would not take them, and asked the brahman what those fruits
<div n="lb">were. The brahman did not know, as his recitations had
<div n="lb">never been connected with any special purpose; he told the
<div n="lb">king that Truth required that he should take them as he
<div n="lb">had asked for them (the signification of Truth). {%Dharma%}
<div n="lb">and Heaven {%(Svargaḥ)%} seconded the brahman. {%Ikṣvāku%}
<div n="lb">wished to give his own merits instead, but in vain then
<div n="lb">{%Ikṣvāku%} agreed to accept half the brahman's merit on the
<div n="lb">condition that the brahman should take half of his own,
<div n="lb">but he was refused. At this time two ungainly individuals
<div n="lb">came there, {%Virūpa%} and {%Vikṛta%} (afterwards disclosed to be
<div n="lb">{%Desire%} and {%Wrath%}) {%Virūpa%} said that he owed {%Vikṛta%} the
<div n="lb">merits of the gift of a cow, but that {%Vikṛta%} refused to take
<div n="lb">repayment (in the form of the merit of having given two
<div n="lb">{%kapilā%} cows with calves to an {%uñchavṛtti%}); {%Vikṛta%} declared
<div n="lb">that {%Virūpa%} owed him nothing; they asked {%Ikṣvāku%} to decide
<div n="lb">the question. {%Ikṣvāku%} hesitated; the brahman threatened to
<div n="lb">curse him. {%Ikṣvāku%} would give him some drops of water
<div n="lb">that had fallen upon his hand. {%Virūpa%} approved of this
<div n="lb">arrangement, and said that {%Vikṛta%} really did not owe him
<div n="lb">anything; “we appealed to thee for thy own sake.” {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said that a reciter goes to {%Brahmán,%} or {%Agni,%} or {%Sūrya.%} whose
<div n="lb">attributes he catches stupefied by attachment {%(rāgeṇa);%} and
<div n="lb">so also if he goes to {%Soma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); if, however, he goes to,
<div n="lb">those regions after having freed himself from attachment, he
<div n="lb">enters the Supreme and Imperishable, and becomes {%Bráhman%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@199@}). The brahman accepted, worshipped {%Dharma,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and set himself to his recitations again. Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Ikṣvāku,%} he agreed that he should go half and half with the
<div n="lb">king. {%Indra%} came there with D., Lp., Sā., Vi., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and
<div n="lb">said to the brahman and the king that they had attained to
<div n="lb">success {%([saṃ]siddhaḥ).%} Those two withdrew their senses
<div n="lb">from the objects of the world; fixing {%Praṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the
[Page354-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">heart, they concentrated the mind in {%Prāṇa%} and {%Apāna%}
<div n="lb">united together, etc. (description). {%Brahmán%} welcomed the
<div n="lb">fiery flame that had issued from the head of the brahman,
<div n="lb">saying: “Reciters attain to the same end as the {%yogins;%}
<div n="lb">but as regards reciters, the honour is ordained for them that
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} himself shall advance to receive them”; then he
<div n="lb">once more imparted consciousness into that splendour; the
<div n="lb">brahman then entered the mouth of {%Brahmán,%} and so did the
<div n="lb">king. The deities rejoiced. {%Brahmán%} said that so also would
<div n="lb">he that reads “the great {%Smṛti%}” and “the {%Anusmṛti%}”
<div n="lb">(i.e. resp. “the six {%Aṅgas%} and {%Manu,%} etc.,” Nīl.) in this
<div n="lb">way attain to the same region with {%Brahmán;%} and so also he
<div n="lb">who is devoted to {%Yoga.%} Then {%Brahmán%} disappeared, and
<div n="lb">the deities, having honoured {%Dharma,%} returned to their
<div n="lb">respective abodes (XII, {@200@}).
