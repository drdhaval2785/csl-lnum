{@Laṅkāpraveśa@}¦ (“the entry into Laṅkā”). § 536 (cf.
<div n="lb">Rāmopākhyānap.). Rāvaṇa made Laṅkā yet more strong
<div n="lb">and armed his warriors. Rāma sent the monkey Aṅgada as
<div n="lb">messenger to Rāvaṇa. Aṅgada delivered the message of
<div n="lb">Rāma: “Release Sītā.” Rāvaṇa became furious. Aṅgada
<div n="lb">leaped up with four Rākṣasas and then let them fall; then
<div n="lb">he leaped over the walls of Laṅkā and informed Rāma.
<div n="lb">Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, and Jāmbavat with monkeys
<div n="lb">and bears attacked Laṅkā and pulled down the fortifications.
<div n="lb">Then the host of the Rākṣasas set out at the command of
<div n="lb">Rāvaṇa. A great battle ensued; at last Rāma withdrew his
<div n="lb">troops (III, {@284@}).
