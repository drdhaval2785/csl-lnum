[{@Bhaṅgāsvanopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
<div n="lb">to Bhaṅgāsvana”). § 728{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: In
<div n="lb">days of yore lived R.-ṛ. {%Bhaṅgāsvana,%} who, being childless, from
<div n="lb">desire of obtaining issue performed the {%Agniṣṭuta,%} that is
<div n="lb">disliked by {%Indra,%} but is approved of by men desirous of
<div n="lb">offspring, in order to purge themselves of their sins
<div n="lb">({%prāyaścitteṣu,%} v. the note of PCR., p. 44). He had 100
<div n="lb">sons. {%Indra%} began to look for an occasion against him.
<div n="lb">Once, on a hunting expedition, he was bewildered by {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">and, afflicted with thirst, he plunged into a lake after having
<div n="lb">caused his horse to drink, and found himself changed into
<div n="lb">a woman. He took leave of his wives and children and
<div n="lb">retired to the woods, joined an ascetic and bore him 100 sons,
<div n="lb">whom he took to his former children, and made them all enjoy
<div n="lb">the kingdom as their joint property. Filled with rage, {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">in the form of a brahman, repaired to {%Bhaṅgāsvana's%} capital,
<div n="lb">and, referring them to the example of the gods and the {%Asuras%}
<div n="lb">(the children of {%Kaśyapa%}), caused the half-brothers to slay
<div n="lb">each other. Then, in the form of a brahman, he came to
<div n="lb">the spot where {%Bhaṅgāsvana%} lived as an ascetic lady, afflicted
<div n="lb">with grief, and told him that he was {%Indra,%} and why he was
[Page119-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">angry, but was gratified and granted him a boon. He asked
<div n="lb">that those sons of his should revive that were born by him
<div n="lb">as a woman, because the affection entertained by a woman
<div n="lb">is much greater than that which is entertained by a man.
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} revived all his children, and told him to choose which-
<div n="lb">ever sex he liked, that of woman or that of man. He chose
<div n="lb">to remain a woman, because in sexual intercourse the pleasure
<div n="lb">that women enjoy is always much greater than what is
<div n="lb">enjoyed by men. {%Indra%} proceeded to heaven (XIII, {@12@}).
