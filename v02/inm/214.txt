{@Agastya@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ a ṛṣi, brother of Vasiṣṭha and son of Mitra and
<div n="lb">Varuṇa;
<sup>*</sup> he is called Maitrāvaruṇi (“son of Mitra and
<div n="lb">Varuṇa”) and Kumbhayoni (“born in a jar”) (see below);
<div n="lb">he once saw his ancestors hanging in a cave, and was urged
<div n="lb">by them to procure progeny; he then from the most beautiful
<div n="lb">parts of all animals created Lopāmudrā and let her become
<div n="lb">the daughter of the king of Vidarbha; when he had married
<div n="lb">her he, in order to procure riches for her, applied successively
<div n="lb">to three kings, and then to the Dānava Ilvala, who shaped
<div n="lb">his own younger brother into a he-goat that was digested by
<div n="lb">Agastya. Agastya had a son by Lopāmudrā named Dṛḍhasyu
<div n="lb">or Idhmavāha. {%A.%} prevailed upon the Vindhya mountain
<div n="lb">to cease to increase in height “till he had returned from
<div n="lb">the South,” and drunk up the Sea (and digested it), in
<div n="lb">order that the gods might overcome the Kālakeyas. § 382
