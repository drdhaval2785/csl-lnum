{@[Kāmyakavanapraveśa(ḥ)]@}¦ (“proceeding to the Kām-
<div n="lb">yaka-wood,” cf. Arjunābhigamanap.). § 328: As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">declared that {%Bhūriśravas, Śala, Jalasandha,%} etc., and {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">(master of all weapons, etc.), and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} together
<div n="lb">with the kings who had been injured by the {%Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb">could not now be vanquished, that all the {%Kaurava%} soldiers
<div n="lb">and their families had been honoured with wealth and
<div n="lb">luxuries by {%Duryodhana,%} and would sacrifice their lives for
<div n="lb">him, and that, although {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and {%Kṛpa,%} all
<div n="lb">knowing celestial weapons and being invincible, behaved
<div n="lb">equally towards both parties, they would certainly, to pay off
<div n="lb">the royal favours they enjoyed, lay down their very lives
<div n="lb">in battle, {%Bhīma%} remained silent.—§ 329: While they were
<div n="lb">conversing thus {%Vyāsa%} appeared, and, taking {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} into
<div n="lb">a corner, taught him, after he had purified himself {%(śuddhaye),%}
<div n="lb">the science of {%Pratismṛti,%} by means of which {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) should
[Page380-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">proceed to {%Mahendra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Kubera,%} and {%Yama,%} to receive
<div n="lb">weapons from them. He also advised him to go to some other
<div n="lb">forest in order not to cause uneasiness to the ascetics and
<div n="lb">exterminate the deer and destroy the plants. Then {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">disappeared. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} went to the forest of {%Kāmyaka%}
<div n="lb">on the banks of the {%Sarasvatī,%} followed by numerous brahmans
<div n="lb">versed in {%śikṣā%} and {%akṣara%} (see § 322), and lived there
<div n="lb">devoted to the {%Dhanurveda,%} and sacrificing to the {%Pitṛs,%} the
<div n="lb">gods, and the brahmans (III, {@36@}).
