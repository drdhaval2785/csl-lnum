{@[Nivātakavacayuddhaparvan(°va).]@}¦ (“Arjuna's
<div n="lb">combat with the Nivātakavacas,” the 39th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr.) § 441: One day, when the Pārthas
<div n="lb">were thinking of {%Arjuna,%} they saw {%Indra's%} chariot (in which
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} had slain seven phalanxes of {%Diti's%} sons), driven
<div n="lb">by {%Mātali,%} illuminating the sky, and {%Arjuna%} descended
<div n="lb">and saluted each of them; {%Mātali%} also greeted and instructed
<div n="lb">them, and then returned in the chariot to {%Indra. Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">then gave to {%Draupadī%} precious gems, etc., presented to him
<div n="lb">by {%Indra.%} Then he related all as it had happened, and slept
<div n="lb">that night with the two sons of {%Mādrī%} (III, {@165@}). The
<div n="lb">next morning {%Indra%} visited them under the sound of musical
<div n="lb">instruments, etc., and blessed {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and advised
<div n="lb">him to repair to {%Kāmyaka.%} Blessing upon the reader
<div n="lb">(III, {@166@}).—§ 442: When {%Indra%} had gone, {%Arjuna%} related
<div n="lb">his journey from {%Kāmyaka%} (see §§ 330—3), etc. (of mountains
<div n="lb">he mentioned only {%Bhṛgutuṅga,%} where he spent one night
<div n="lb">and subsequently saw the brahman; then {%Himavat,%} where the
<div n="lb">meeting with the {%Kirāta%} took place on the first day of the
<div n="lb">fifth month after the beginning of his penances; the {%Kirāta%}
<div n="lb">multiplied a hundredfold and a thousandfold, and was
<div n="lb">transformed in various manners; {%Arjuna%} in vain employed
<div n="lb">the {%Vāyavya, Sthūṇākarṇa%} (see Nīl.), {%Jāla%} (i.e. {%Vāruṇa,%} Nīl.),
<div n="lb">and the {%Śalabhāstra,%} and showers of shafts and stones, as the
<div n="lb">{%Kirāta%} swallowed them up all; {%Arjuna%} in vain discharged
<div n="lb">the {%Brahmāstra%}) (III, {@167@}).—§ 443: {%Arjuna%} continued his
<div n="lb">narrative (see §§ 334—7): he passed the night after the
<div n="lb">meeting with the {%Kirāta%} at that place, and in the morning
<div n="lb">he saw again the same brahman (= {%Indra%}), and in the
<div n="lb">evening he had the visit of the {%Lokapālas;%} the weapons
<div n="lb">that {%Indra%} promised to teach him were: those of {%Vāyu, Agni,%}
<div n="lb">the {%Vasus, Varuṇa,%} the {%Maruts,%} the {%Sādhya%} and {%Paitāmaha%}
<div n="lb">weapons, those of the {%Gandharvas, Uragas%} (i.e. Snakes), and
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas,%} and all the {%Vaiṣṇava%} and {%Nairṛta%} weapons [v. 12020
<div n="lb">foll.]; in the chariot of {%Indra, Mātali%} wondered that {%Arjuna%}
[Page521-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">was not jerked, though {%Indra%} always himself gets jerked at
<div n="lb">the first pull by the steeds [v. 12030]; when he had learnt
<div n="lb">the weapons, {%Indra%} said that now even the gods could not
<div n="lb">conquer him (v. 12054); he had received knowledge of
<div n="lb">fifteen weapons with five modes of using them, viz. {%Prayoga%}
<div n="lb">[discharge], {%upasaṃhāra%} [withdrawal], {%āvṛtti%} [redischarge],
<div n="lb">{%prāyaścitta%} [revival of harmless beings slain by any weapon,
<div n="lb">PCR., Nīl.], and {%pratighāta%} [revival of weapons baffled by
<div n="lb">those of the enemies, PCR., Nīl.] (vv. 12058—9); {%Indra%} asked
<div n="lb">him, as his fee, to slay the {%Nivātakavacas,%} who were
<div n="lb">thirty millions {%(tisraḥ koṭyaḥ)%} in number and dwelt in the
<div n="lb">ocean, and gave him the chariot (conducted by {%Mātali%}),
<div n="lb">upon which he {%(Indra)%} had vanquished {%Bali%} ({%Baliṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%Vairocaniṃ,%} v. 12068), {%Śambara, Bala, Vṛtra, Prahlāda,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Naraka,%} and millions of {%Daityas,%} and “this” diadem,
<div n="lb">and ornaments like his own, and the impenetrable mail, and
<div n="lb">fastened “this” durable {%(ajarāṃ)%} string to the {%Gāṇḍīva,%}
<div n="lb">and the gods gave him the shell {%Devadatta,%} through which
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} had conquered the worlds (cf. § 446) (III, {@168@}).—§ 444:
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} continued: When he came to the ocean, he saw at
<div n="lb">a short distance the {%Daitya%} city filled with {%Dānavas. Mātali%}
<div n="lb">drove the chariot with force, and the {%Dānavas%} shut the gates.
<div n="lb">Then {%Arjuna%} blew the {%Devadatta,%} and the {%Nivātakavacas%}
<div n="lb">appeared with iron javelins, maces, clubs, hatchets, sabres,
<div n="lb">discs, {%śataghnīs, bhuśuṇḍīs,%} and swords, and sounded dissonant
<div n="lb">musical instruments. The {%Devarṣis,%} the {%Dānavarṣis,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Brahmarṣis,%} and the {%Siddhas%} came to the battle (III, {@169@}).
<div n="lb">With arrows inspired with {%mantras%} relating to the {%Brahman-%}
<div n="lb">weapon {%(Brahmāstraparimantritaiḥ),%} then with the {%Mādhava%}
<div n="lb">(PCR. Māghava) weapon and the {%Gāṇḍīva Arjuna%} killed
<div n="lb">innumerable {%Nivātakavacas,%} and the 10,000 horses yoked at
<div n="lb">the chariot conducted by {%Mātali%} trampled upon them
<div n="lb">(III, {@170@}). {%Arjuna%} reduced a shower of crags to powder
<div n="lb">by the {%Mahendra%} weapon, then dried up showers of water by
<div n="lb">the weapon {%Viśoṣana,%} that he had acquired from {%Indra;%} then
<div n="lb">he annihilated fire by the water weapon {%(salilāstra),%} and
<div n="lb">by the stone weapon {%(śailena mahāstreṇa)%} he repeatedly
<div n="lb">resisted the wind. Then darkness enveloped the world; the
<div n="lb">steeds turned away, {%Mātali%} fell off, and the golden lash
<div n="lb">fell from his hand; as {%Mātali%} was stupefied, a terrible
<div n="lb">fear seized {%Arjuna; Mātali%} said that he had conducted
<div n="lb">{%Indra's%} chariot in the battle for the sake of nectar, and in
<div n="lb">the battles with {%Śambara, Vṛtra, Vairocani,%} etc., but never
<div n="lb">had he lost his senses before. {%Arjuna%} comforted {%Mātali%}
<div n="lb">and repeatedly frustrated the magic of the enemy, and
<div n="lb">{%Mātali%} again conducted the chariot. Then on a sudden
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} did not see the {%Dānavas,%} who had become hidden
<div n="lb">by illusion {%(māyā)%} (III, {@171@}). {%Arjuna%} then fought with
<div n="lb">invisible weapons. Then they withdrew the illusion and
<div n="lb">entered their city. The fallen and their weapons covered
<div n="lb">the ground so that the horses had to proceed in the
<div n="lb">sky. The {%Nivātakavacas%} remaining invisible, covered the
<div n="lb">welkin with crags; others, entering into the earth, seized
<div n="lb">the legs of the horses and the wheels of the chariot.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} became distressed, but being advised by {%Mātali,%}
<div n="lb">he applied the thunderbolt, inspiring the {%Gāṇḍīva%} with
<div n="lb">{%mantras,%} so that the arrows sent by the thunderbolt,
<div n="lb">becoming thunderbolts, penetrated the illusions and killed
<div n="lb">the {%Nivātakavacas.%} While the wives of {%Dānavas%} were
<div n="lb">bewailing and at last fled to their palaces, {%Arjuna%} and
<div n="lb">{%Mātali%} entered the city, that was superior to that of the
<div n="lb">gods (to that of {%Indra,%} v. 12188). {%Mātali%} told him that
<div n="lb">this was originally the city of {%Indra,%} but the gods had
[Page521-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">been driven away from it by the {%Nivātakavacas,%} who
<div n="lb">had through austerities gratified {%Pitāmaha%} and obtained
<div n="lb">from him the boons, that they might reside here and
<div n="lb">be free from danger from the gods. When {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">applied to {%Svayambhū,%} he was told that he himself
<div n="lb">in another body should destroy them. As the gods
<div n="lb">were unable to slay them, {%Indra%} had given those weapons
<div n="lb">to {%Arjuna,%} so that he might destroy them, Then {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">and {%Mātali%} again went to the abode of the gods (III, {@172@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 445: While returning he beheld a celestial city,
<div n="lb">moving at will, with trees of gems, etc., with four gates, etc.,
<div n="lb">and {%Mātali%} told him it was {%Hiraṇyapura,%} made by {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">himself for the great {%Asuras,%} the {%Paulomas,%} and {%Kālakañjas,%}
<div n="lb">as the {%Daiteyī Pulomā%} and the {%Mahāsurī Kālakā%} had by
<div n="lb">practising austerities for 1,000 celestial years obtained from
<div n="lb">{%Svayambhū%} that their offspring should suffer little misfortune,
<div n="lb">be incapable of being killed by gods, and obtain an aërial,
<div n="lb">etc., city, invincible even by the gods, {%Maharṣis, Yakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas, Pannagas, Asuras,%} and {%Rākṣasas. Brahmán%} had
<div n="lb">destined that {%Arjuna,%} a mortal, should kill them. “Therefore
<div n="lb">destroy them with the thunderbolt.” A battle ensued; the
<div n="lb">{%Asuras%} resorted to illusion; the city now entered into the
<div n="lb">earth, and now it rose upwards, etc. Shot with the iron
<div n="lb">shafts of {%Arjuna%} the city fell down. Then they environed
<div n="lb">him in 60,000 chariots, etc. {%Arjuna%} applied to {%Rudra,%} and
<div n="lb">seeing a man with three heads, nine eyes, etc., he applied
<div n="lb">the {%Raudra%} weapon to the {%Gāṇḍīva;%} when it had been
<div n="lb">hurled, there appeared forms of deer, lions, tigers, {%Garuḍas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Asuras, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas, Yātudhānas,%}
<div n="lb">etc., by thousands. The {%Dānavas,%} some of whom had three
<div n="lb">heads, some four tusks, etc., were destroyed. {%Arjuna%} again
<div n="lb">worshipped {%Tripuraghna%} (i.e. Śiva). {%Mātali%} rejoiced and
<div n="lb">praised {%Arjuna.%} The wives of the {%Dānavas%} came out of the
<div n="lb">city bewailing the slain. {%Mātali%} took {%Arjuna%} to the abode
<div n="lb">of {%Indra,%} and related in detail to {%Indra Arjuna's%} achievement,
<div n="lb">and {%Indra%} with the {%Maruts%} (v. 12269: the gods) praised
<div n="lb">him, and said that gods, {%Dānavas, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas, Asuras,%}
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas,%} birds, and serpents should not be able to resist
<div n="lb">him in fight, etc. (III, {@173@}).—§ 446: {%Indra%} said that on the
<div n="lb">battlefield {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa, Śakuni,%} etc., should
<div n="lb">not amount to (1/16) part of {%Arjuna.%} Then {%Indra%} gave him
<div n="lb">“this” golden garland, the shell {%Devadatta,%} etc. (see § 443).
<div n="lb">Then {%Indra%} told him to depart, “and thus after five years
<div n="lb">I come to you on the summit of this lower range of
<div n="lb">{%Gandhamādana (Gandhamādanapādasya).%}” Having promised
<div n="lb">that he should in the next morning show {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} all the
<div n="lb">celestial weapons, {%Arjuna%} passed that night there with all his
<div n="lb">brothers (III, {@174@}).—§ 447: The next morning, when {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">was about to show the celestial weapons to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} the
<div n="lb">earth trembled, etc. The {%Brahmarṣis, Siddhas, Maharṣis,%}
<div n="lb">{%Devarṣis,%} gods, {%Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">{%Pitāmaha,%} the {%Lokāpālas,%} and {%Mahādeva%} with his {%gaṇas%}
<div n="lb">appeared; {%Vāyu%} threw celestial garlands, sent by the gods,
<div n="lb">on {%Arjuna,%} the {%Gandharvas%} chanted ballads, and {%Apsarases%}
<div n="lb">danced; and sent by the gods {%Nārada%} came and prevailed
<div n="lb">upon {%Arjuna%} not to use the celestial weapons without
<div n="lb">necessity, as they would destroy the three worlds. Then
<div n="lb">the gods, etc., went whence they had come, and the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} pleasantly dwelt in that same forest with {%Kṛṣṇā%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@175@}).
