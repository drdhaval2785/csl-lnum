{@[Kīṭopākhyāna]@}¦ (“the episode relating to the worm”).
<div n="lb">§ 762{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of old, when
<div n="lb">the emancipated {%(Brahmabhūtaḥ)%} brahman {%Vyāsa%} roamed over
<div n="lb">the world, he saw a worm speedily moving on a chariot-road.
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Vyāsa,%} who was omniscient and knew the language
<div n="lb">of every animal, the worm said that it was running away
<div n="lb">from a large cart, lest it should be killed; every creature, in
<div n="lb">whatever situation it may be placed, becomes attached to it;
<div n="lb">“in even this order of being I am happy, I think, and wish
<div n="lb">to live”; in his former life he was a cruel {%Śūdra,%} a usurer,
<div n="lb">etc., never dedicating food to D. and P., etc. (description);
<div n="lb">he now was filled with repentance and grief; he had, however,
<div n="lb">worshipped his old mother, and once showed hospitality to
<div n="lb">a brahman; in consequence thereof the memory had not
<div n="lb">forsaken him, and he thought he should once more regain
<div n="lb">happiness (XIII, {@117@}). {%Vyāsa%} said: “It is the consequence
<div n="lb">of a meritorious act of mine that thou art not stupefied; in
<div n="lb">consequence of my penances I am able to rescue a being of
<div n="lb">demerit by the simply granting him sight of my person; there
<div n="lb">is no stronger power than that of penances. Thou mayst
<div n="lb">again attain to righteousness and merit; the state of a worm
<div n="lb">is really fraught with great misery. The superior brahman
[Page409-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">worships the Sun and the Moon uttering {%mantras;%} when thou
<div n="lb">hast attained to that state, I shall impart to thee {%Bráhman.%}”
<div n="lb">The worm remained and was killed by the cart. He was
<div n="lb">reborn in diverse orders of being, such as a porcupine, Iguana,
<div n="lb">boar, deer, bird, {%Cāṇḍāla, Śūdra,%} and {%Vaiśya.%} Born at last as
<div n="lb">a {%Kṣatriya%} (with {%Kāmboja%} steeds, {%Sūtas%} and {%Māgadhas,%} etc.;
<div n="lb">description) through the grace of {%Vyāsa,%} he came and
<div n="lb">worshipped him. {%Vyāsa%} said that the sin of his former life
<div n="lb">had yet not been destroyed; he should become a brahman by
<div n="lb">giving up his life on the field of battle for the sake of cows
<div n="lb">or brahmans; performing many sacrifices he should attain to
<div n="lb">heaven, and after emancipation {%(Brahma-bhūtaḥ)%} he should
<div n="lb">enjoy eternal happiness. The ascending order of transmigration
<div n="lb">is: († v. 5774) animal {%> Śūdra > Vaiśya > Kṣatriya >%}
<div n="lb">{%Brahman > Svarga%} (XIII, {@118@}). He betook himself to severe
<div n="lb">austerities; {%Vyāsa%} went to him and said that the penances of
<div n="lb">the {%Kṣatriyas%} consist in the protection of all creatures;
<div n="lb">thereby he should attain to the state of a brahman. Then he
<div n="lb">protected his subjects righteously, and after death became
<div n="lb">a brahman. {%Vyāsa%} came and told him not to fear death, but
<div n="lb">only the loss of righteousness. He caused the earth to be
<div n="lb">marked with 100 sacrificial stakes, and then obtained a
<div n="lb">residence in the region of {%Brahmán%} himself, and obtained the
<div n="lb">eternal {%Bráhman%} by his own acts, according to the words
<div n="lb">of {%Vyāsa.%} Also the {%Kṣatriyas,%} who have been slain [on the
<div n="lb">field of Kurukṣetra], have attained to a meritorious end
<div n="lb">{%(gatiṃ puṇyāṃ);%} therefore, do not mourn on their account”
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@119@}).
