{@Śākadvīpa,@}¦ a dvīpa named after the Śāka-tree. § 575
<div n="lb">(Bhūmip.): VI, {@11<lang n="greek"></lang>,@} 402.—§ 575{%b%} (do.): {%Ś.%} is of twice the
<div n="lb">extent of {%Jambudvīpa,%} and the ocean also is of twice the
<div n="lb">extent of that island. {%Ś.%} is surrounded on all sides by the
<div n="lb">ocean. The kingdoms there are full of righteousness, and
<div n="lb">the men never die; there is no famine; the people are
[Page183-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">all full of forbearance and great energy. There are
<div n="lb">seven mountains decked with jewels, etc., and many rivers.
<div n="lb">The mountains are: (1) {%Meru,%} the abode of D., Ṛ., and G.;
<div n="lb">(2) {%Malaya,%} to the east; there the clouds are generated, and
<div n="lb">thence they disperse on all sides; (3) {%Jaladhāra,%} whence
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} daily takes water, and from that we get showers of
<div n="lb">rain; (4) {%Raivataka,%} over which the constellation {%Revati%} is
<div n="lb">placed by {%Brahmán%} himself; (5) on the north of this is
<div n="lb">{%Śyāma.%} Because the hue of these mountains is dark, the
<div n="lb">people residing there are all dark in complexion; (6) {%Durga-%}
<div n="lb">{%śaila;%} (7) {%Keśarin%} (B. {%Kesara%}). The measure of each of these
<div n="lb">mountains is double that of the one mentioned immediately
<div n="lb">before. There are seven {%Varṣas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>,) one for each mountain.
<div n="lb">In the midst is a large tree called {%Śāka,%} in height and breadth
<div n="lb">equal to the {%Jambu%}-tree in {%Jambudvīpa,%} and it is always adored
<div n="lb">by the people. There are many delightful provinces where
<div n="lb">{%Śiva%} is worshipped, and thither repair D., Si., and Cā. The
<div n="lb">people are virtuous, and all the four orders are devoted to their
<div n="lb">respective occupations. There is no instance of theft. They
<div n="lb">are free from decrepitude and death, and gifted with long life.
<div n="lb">The rivers (<lang n="greek"></lang>) are full of sacred water whence {%Indra%} draws
<div n="lb">water to shower it as rain. {%Gaṅgā%} herself is among them. They
<div n="lb">are all sin-cleansing. There are four sacred provinces (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">There is no king and no punishment, and no person that
<div n="lb">deserves to be punished: VI, {@11,@} 408, 411, 413, 441.—
<div n="lb">§ 623 (Rājadh.): XII, {@14<lang n="greek"></lang>,@} 406 (east of Meru, swayed
<div n="lb">by Yudhiṣṭhira), 407.
