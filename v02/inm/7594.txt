{@[Nāradāgamanaparvan]@}¦ (“the section containing the
<div n="lb">arrival of Nārada,” the ninety-seventh of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mahābhārata; cf. Nāradāgamana).—§ 792: {%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">said: Two years after their return from the retreat of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were visited by D.-ṛ. {%Nārada.%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired after {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. {%Nārada%} said:
<div n="lb">After thy return from {%Kurukṣetra, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} proceeded
<div n="lb">towards {%Gaṅgādvāra%} with the sacrificial fire and {%Gāndhārī,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī, Sañjaya,%} and all the {%yājakas.%} They themselves took to
<div n="lb">severe austerities (description), while the sacred fire was duly
<div n="lb">worshipped by the {%yājakas.%} They wandered about, {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">acting as a guide, {%Pṛthā%} becoming the eye of {%Gāndhārī.%}
<div n="lb">Once Dhṛtarāṣṭra bathed in the {%Gaṅgā,%} and was returning to
<div n="lb">his retreat. A violent forest conflagration set in; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">dismissed {%Sañjaya%} and sat down, facing the east, with
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī;%} they concentrated their soul, and were
<div n="lb">burnt by the conflagration. {%Sañjaya%} escaped and was seen
<div n="lb">by me {%(Nārada)%} on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā%} in the midst of
<div n="lb">ascetics; he bade them farewell and started for {%Himavat.%}
<div n="lb">In the course of my wanderings I saw the three bodies. The
<div n="lb">ascetics, from whom I heard all the details, did not at all
<div n="lb">grieve for them. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">the citizens felt great grief (XV, {@37@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">lamented (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XV, {@38@}). {%Nārada%} comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">by informing him of the sacred character of the fire that had
<div n="lb">burnt {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and the two queens. When {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">entered the woods he caused his sacrificial fires to be duly
<div n="lb">ignited; having performed his sacred rites with them
<div n="lb">he abandoned them all; then the {%Yājakas%} had left them
<div n="lb">in a solitary part of the wood and gone away; the fires
<div n="lb">thus left to themselves produced a general conflagration;
<div n="lb">“this is what I have heard from the ascetics on the {%Gaṅgā.%}”
[Page507-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Headed by {%Yuyutsu%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">the citizens all proceeded to the {%Gaṅgā%} in order to offer
<div n="lb">oblations of water to the deceased king and queens. Then
<div n="lb">they came back, taking up their residence outside the city.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent, a number of men to the retreat to cremate
<div n="lb">the remains of his uncle, aunt, and mother in due form.
<div n="lb">On the twelfth day he performed the {%śrāddhas%} with gifts in
<div n="lb">abundance (description). Then all returned to {%Hāstinapura.%}
<div n="lb">The great Ṛ. {%Nārada,%} having comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} went
<div n="lb">away. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had passed three years in the forest
<div n="lb">and fifteen years in the city. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was plunged in
<div n="lb">grief [*; not in B.] (XV, {@39@}).
