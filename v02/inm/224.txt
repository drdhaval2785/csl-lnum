[{@Agastyopākhyāna.@}]¦ § 382 (Tīrthay.): In the city of
<div n="lb">{%Maṇimatī%} there lived formerly a {%Daiteya Ilvala,%} whose
<div n="lb">younger brother was {%Vātāpi%} ({%Prāhrādi,%} v. 8645). {%Ilvala,%}
<div n="lb">inflamed with wrath against all brahmans, because a brahman
<div n="lb">had refused to grant him a son equal to {%Indra,%} used to
<div n="lb">transform {%Vātāpi%} into a ram and offer his flesh to brahmans
<div n="lb">as food, and then to recall him to life (whomsoever {%Ilvala%}
<div n="lb">summoned with his voice would come back even from the
<div n="lb">abode of {%Yama%}), and {%Vātāpi,%} ripping the flanks of the
<div n="lb">brahmans, would come out laughing. Thus they killed many
<div n="lb">brahmans. Meanwhile {%Agastya%} saw his ancestors hanging in
<div n="lb">a hole with the heads downwards, and was asked by them to
<div n="lb">procure offspring to them. As he did not see any wife
<div n="lb">worthy of himself, he selected the most beautiful parts from
<div n="lb">various creatures and created an excellent woman, whom he
<div n="lb">caused to be born as the daughter of the {%Vidarbha%} king, who
<div n="lb">was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining offspring.
<div n="lb">She was named {%Lopāmudrā,%} and was very beautiful. When she
<div n="lb">attained to puberty no one dared to ask for her hand (III, {@96@}).
<div n="lb">When {%Agastya%} asked the {%Vidarbha%} king to bestow her upon him,
<div n="lb">the king and his queen became much afflicted, but at her own
<div n="lb">request {%Lopāmudrā%} was bestowed upon {%Agastya,%} who im-
<div n="lb">mediately asked her to discard her ornaments and dress herself
<div n="lb">in rags and barks and deer-skins and partake of his vows, and
<div n="lb">proceeding to {%Gaṅgādvāra%} they practised the severest penances.
<div n="lb">When at last he summoned her for marital intercourse she
<div n="lb">made it a condition that he should approach her on a bed like
<div n="lb">to that which she had in the palace of her father, and that
[Page018-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">both should be adorned with costly ornaments, and she told
<div n="lb">him to procure these things without impairing his ascetic
<div n="lb">merit (III, {@97@}). {%Agastya%} then went to King {%Śrutarvan%} and
<div n="lb">asked him for wealth, but seeing that his expenditure was
<div n="lb">equal to his income, he took nothing, but, together with
<div n="lb">{%Śrutarvan,%} went to King {%Bradhnaśva,%} with the same result;
<div n="lb">then all three went to King {%Trasadasyu Paurukutsa%} of the line
<div n="lb">of {%Ikṣvāku,%} with the same result. At the suggestion of the
<div n="lb">three kings they all four went to {%Ilvala%} (III, {@98@}). {%Ilvala%} went
<div n="lb">out with his ministers to receive them on the confines of his
<div n="lb">domain. He prepared the flesh of {%Vātāpi%} in order to entertain
<div n="lb">them, at which the kings became sad, but {%Agastya%} ate it all,
<div n="lb">and when {%Ilvala%} summoned {%Vātāpi%} there came only air out
<div n="lb">of {%Agastya's%} stomach, {%Vātāpi%} having already been digested.
<div n="lb">Then {%Ilvala,%} becoming sad, promised to give them wealth if
<div n="lb">{%Agastya%} could tell him what he intended to give, and {%Agastya%}
<div n="lb">rightly said that he intended to give each of the kings 10,000
<div n="lb">cows and as many gold coins, and to {%Agastya%} twice as much,
<div n="lb">and a car that would be found to be a golden one, with two
<div n="lb">steeds ({%Virāva%} and {%Surāva%}). The car brought {%Agastya%} and the
<div n="lb">kings to {%Agastya's%} hermitage within the twinkling of an eye.
<div n="lb">Then the {%rājarṣis%} went away to their cities. When {%Agastya%}
<div n="lb">proposed to {%Lopāmudrā%} to choose between 1000 sons, or 100
<div n="lb">each equal to 10, or 10 each equal to 100, or 1 equal to 1000,
<div n="lb">she chose the last alternative. After she had conceived he
<div n="lb">retired into the forest. After seven years she gave birth to
<div n="lb">{%Drḍhasyu,%} who came out as if repeating the {%Vedas%} with the
<div n="lb">{%Upaniṣads%} and {%Aṅgas;%} and from carrying, while yet a child,
<div n="lb">loads of sacrificial fuel to the hermitage of his father, he was
<div n="lb">called {%Idhmavāha. Agastya%} was highly pleased, and his
<div n="lb">ancestors obtained the {%lokas%} they desired.—§ 384: In the
<div n="lb">kṛta age the {%Dānava%} tribes named {%Kālakeyas%} under {%Vṛtra%}
<div n="lb">pursued the gods under {%Indra.%} The gods, on the suggestion
<div n="lb">of Brahmán, with {%Nārāyaṇa%} at their head, proceeded to the
<div n="lb">hermitage of the ṛṣi {%Dadhīca%} on the other bank of {%Sarasvatī,%}
<div n="lb">and having prevailed upon him to leave his body, they caused
<div n="lb">{%Tvaṣṭṛ%} to construct of his bones the six-sided {%(ṣaḍaśri) vajra%}
<div n="lb">which {%Tvaṣṭṛ%} handed to {%Indra%} that he might slay {%Vṛtra%}
<div n="lb">with it (III, {@100@}). In the encounter that ensued between
<div n="lb">the gods and the {%Kālakeyas%} the gods were defeated, until
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa,%} the gods, and the {%brahmarṣis%} had transferred
<div n="lb">their own vigour to {%Indra.%} He then hurled the {%vajra%}
<div n="lb">against {%Vṛtra%} and slew him so that he fell headlong like the
<div n="lb">{%Mandara%} mountain hurled of yore from {%Viṣṇu's%} hand; but
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} fled in fear, desiring to take shelter in a lake, thinking
<div n="lb">that the {%vajra%} had not been hurled from his hand and that
<div n="lb">{%Vṛtra%} was still alive, while the gods defeated the {%Dānavas,%}
<div n="lb">who fled to the depths of the sea. Here they conspired for
<div n="lb">the destruction of the three worlds, and resolved upon
<div n="lb">destroying all who were possessed of ascetic virtues {%(tapas),%}
<div n="lb">for so the universe would itself be destroyed, as it is supported
<div n="lb">by asceticism (III, {@101@}). Remaining in the depths of the
<div n="lb">sea by day, the {%Kāleyas%} during the night slew the {%munis%} in
<div n="lb">the hermitages and sacred spots {%(puṇyeṣvāyataneṣu);%} in the
<div n="lb">hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha,%} 197 ascetics; in that of {%Cyavana,%} 100;
<div n="lb">in that of {%Bharadvāja,%} 20, without being seen; every morning
<div n="lb">people saw the dead bodies and mutilated limbs of the {%munis%}
<div n="lb">and the disturbed {%agnihotras%} scattered on the ground. Men
<div n="lb">fled for their lives into all directions or killed themselves from
<div n="lb">fear. Some brave bowmen searched in vain for the evildoers.
<div n="lb">The gods with {%Indra%} repaired to {%Nārāyaṇa (c)%} (III, {@102@}).
<div n="lb">They did not know by whom the {%brahmans%} were being killed
<div n="lb">during the night. {%Viṣṇu%} explained the whole affair to them,
[Page018-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and told them to apply to {%Agastya (Maitrāvaruṇi)%} that he
<div n="lb">might dry up the sea, as no one else was capable of so doing.
<div n="lb">They then went to the hermitage of {%Agastya,%} and mentioned
<div n="lb">to him that he had delivered the gods from {%Nahuṣa%} and
<div n="lb">caused {%Vindhya%} to cease to increase in height (in competition
<div n="lb">with the Sun), the world having been covered with darkness
<div n="lb">(III, {@103@}).—§ 385: {%Vindhya%} (q.v.).—§ 386: At the request
<div n="lb">of the gods {%Agastya,%} accompanied by {%ṛṣis,%} gods, men, {%Uragas%}
<div n="lb">(snakes), {%Gandharvas, Yakṣas,%} and {%Kimpuruṣas,%} approached
<div n="lb">the ocean (III, {@104@}) and drank it up, to the amazement of
<div n="lb">the gods, who called him {%Vidhātṛ%} and the creator of the
<div n="lb">worlds, while the musical instruments of {%Gandharvas%} were
<div n="lb">playing, and celestial blossoms were showered upon him.
<div n="lb">The {%Kāleyas,%} who had previously been burnt by the {%tapas%} of
<div n="lb">the {%munis,%} were now destroyed by the gods, except some few
<div n="lb">who, rending asunder the goddess Earth, sought refuge in
<div n="lb">{%Pātāla.%} The gods now asked {%Agastya%} to fill up the ocean
<div n="lb">again, but he had already digested the water. The gods
<div n="lb">with {%Viṣṇu%} came to {%Brahmán%} and spoke to him about
<div n="lb">replenishing the sea (III, {@105@}). {%Brahmán%} dismissed them,
<div n="lb">saying that only after a long course of time the ocean would
<div n="lb">be brought to resume its wonted state by the agnates of king
<div n="lb">{%Bhagīratha.%}
