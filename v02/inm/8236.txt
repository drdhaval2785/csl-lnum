[{@Pativratāmāhātmyaparvan@}]¦ (“the section about the
<div n="lb">greatness of the faithful wife”) (cf. Pativratāyā māhātmyaṃ
<div n="lb">Sāvitryāḥ). § 545: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%}
<div n="lb">related, on account of {%Kṛṣṇā:%} The {%Madra%} king {%Aśvapati,%}
<div n="lb">the husband of {%Mālavī,%} was old and childless. After eighteen
<div n="lb">years of vows and offerings to {%Sāvitrī, Sāvitrī%} granted him
<div n="lb">a boon; he asked for many sons, but was promised a daughter.
<div n="lb">She was called {%Sāvitrī.%} As nobody asked her in marriage, she
<div n="lb">was sent to look for a husband herself (III, {@293@}). She chose
<div n="lb">{%Satyavat,%} the son of the {%Śālva%} king {%Dyumatsena%} (the husband
<div n="lb">of {%Śaibyā%}), who had been blinded and deprived of his kingdom
<div n="lb">and lived as an ascetic in the forest. {%Satyavat%} equalled
<div n="lb">{%Rantideva Sāṅkrti, Śibi Auśīnara, Yayāti,%} etc., but {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">said: “Within a year of this day he will die”; then {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">went to heaven (III, {@294@}). After her marriage {%Sāvitrī%} dressed
<div n="lb">in bark garments, etc. (III, {@295@}). She counted the days, and
<div n="lb">having ascertained that her husband would die on the fourth
<div n="lb">day following, she observed a {%trirātra%} vow; on the fourth day
<div n="lb">all the ascetics uttered benedictions that she should never
<div n="lb">suffer widowhood; she would not eat before the sun set. She
<div n="lb">followed {%Satyavat%} as he, taking his axe, set out for the woods
<div n="lb">(III, {@296@}). He fell ill and slept with his head on her lap.
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} himself—and not his emissary—came with a noose in
<div n="lb">his hand and pulled out of the body of {%Satyavat%} a person of
<div n="lb">the size of a thumb, bound it in the noose and proceeded
<div n="lb">in a southern direction. {%Sāvitrī%} followed him and was granted
<div n="lb">five boons: (1) that her father-in-law should attain his eye-
<div n="lb">sight and be strong; (2) that her father-in-law should regain
<div n="lb">his kingdom and never fall off from his duties; (3) that her
<div n="lb">father should have 100 sons; (4) that she and {%Satyavat%} should
<div n="lb">have 100 sons “begotten from both of us”; (5) that {%Satyavat%}
<div n="lb">should be restored to life and live 400 years. {%Yama%} untied
<div n="lb">the noose; she went back to the corpse and placed his head
<div n="lb">on her lap. {%Satyavat%} regained his consciousness. He was
[Page545-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">anxious about his parents, and they returned to the hermitage
<div n="lb">(III, {@297@}). Meanwhile {%Dyumatsena%} had regained his sight,
<div n="lb">but was anxious at not finding {%Satyavat.%} He was comforted
<div n="lb">by the brahmans {%Suvarcas, Gautama, Bharadvāja, Dālbhya,%}
<div n="lb">{%Apastamba,%} and {%Dhaumya.%} A little while afterwards {%Satyavat%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sāvitrī%} reached the hermitage. {%Sāvitrī%} narrated every-
<div n="lb">thing that had happened and was praised by the ṛṣis (III,
<div n="lb">{@298@}). Meanwhile the enemy of {%Dyumatsena%} had been slain
<div n="lb">by his minister, and {%Dyumatsena%} then again became king of
<div n="lb">the {%Śālvas. Sāvitrī%} after a long time gave birth to 100 sons,
<div n="lb">and her father also got 100 sons by {%Mālavī.%} “So also {%Kṛṣṇā%}
<div n="lb">will rescue ye all.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brothers continued
<div n="lb">to live in the {%Kāmyaka%} forest (III, {@299@}).
