{@Kairātaparvan@}¦ (“the section treating of the Kirāta”),
<div n="lb">the 33rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr., forming an episode
<div n="lb">to Arjuna's journey to the abode of Indra (cf. Kairāta).
<div n="lb">§ 331. It is anew related how {%Arjuna%} set out from the
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka%} wood towards the north; he entered a terrible
<div n="lb">forest (description), resorted to by {%Siddhas%} and {%Cāraṇas,%} and
<div n="lb">then proceeded to the {%Himavat%} (description). For four months
<div n="lb">he practised austerities (specified), until the {%ṛṣis%} made
<div n="lb">representations about it to {%Śiva,%} who dismissed them after
<div n="lb">having removed their fears (III, {@38@}). Then {%Śiva%} with his
<div n="lb">bow and arrows, in the guise of a {%Kirāta,%} accompanied by
<div n="lb">{%Umā%} in the guise of a {%Kirāta%} woman, by merry spirits
<div n="lb">{%(bhūtaiḥ),%} and thousands of women, approached {%Arjuna%} as he
<div n="lb">was about to kill {%Mūka,%} a son of {%Danu,%} who in the form of
<div n="lb">a boar would have killed {%Arjuna. Arjuna%} and {%Śiva%} at the
<div n="lb">same time pierced {%Mūka%} with their arrows, and killed him;
<div n="lb">when dying he again assumed his {%rākṣasa%} form; then they
<div n="lb">fought against each other, first with arrows, then with the
<div n="lb">very bows, then with swords, then with trees and stones,
<div n="lb">then with the fists, and then by clasping each other; at last
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} lost his senses, and was almost reduced to a ball of
<div n="lb">flesh; when he regained consciousness he made a clay image
<div n="lb">of {%Śiva,%} which he worshipped with a garland, which then
<div n="lb">appeared on the head of the {%Kirāta;%} he thus learned that
<div n="lb">it was {%Śiva,%} and prostrated himself at his feet. {%Śiva%} declared
<div n="lb">that {%Arjuna's%} prowess was equal to his own, promised to give
<div n="lb">him his weapon, and gave him ‘eye’ {%(cakṣus),%} so that he
<div n="lb">beheld him in his true form, together with {%Umā.%}—§ 332:
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} then fell on his knees and worshipped him, saying:
<div n="lb">“O {%Kapardin!%} etc.” (v. {%Mahādevastava%}) (III, {@39@}).—§ 333:
<div n="lb">Śiva said that {%Arjuna (b)%} was in a former life {%Nara,%} etc.
<div n="lb">When granted a boon, {%Arjuna%} asked {%Śiva%} to give him the
<div n="lb">{%Pāśupata%} weapon named {%Brahmaśiras (c).%} Having purified
<div n="lb">himself he was instructed in its use on the condition that he
<div n="lb">should not hurl it against a human being, for then it would
<div n="lb">destroy the universe. The earth trembled, etc. The gods
<div n="lb">and {%Dānavas%} beheld the weapon in its bodily shape standing
<div n="lb">by the side of {%Arjuna.%} When {%Arjuna%} had been touched by
<div n="lb">{%Śiva,%} all that was evil in his body was dispelled. Having
<div n="lb">said to {%Arjuna,%} “Go thou into heaven,” {%Śiva%} went up into
<div n="lb">the skies accompanied by {%Umā%} (III, {@40@}).—§ 334: Then
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} was on the {%Himavat%} visited by the {%Lokapālas,%} viz.,
<div n="lb">{%Varuṇa%} (blue as lapis lazuli), together with rivers, {%Nāgas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Daityas,%} and {%Sādhyas; Kubera,%} who dwells on {%Kailāsa,%}
<div n="lb">golden-coloured {%(jāmbūnadavapuḥ),%} accompanied by {%Yakṣas;%}
<div n="lb">{%Yama,%} with staff in hand {%(daṇḍapāṇiḥ),%} illuminating the
<div n="lb">three worlds, and the {%Guhyakas, Gandharvas,%} and {%Nagās,%}
<div n="lb">accompanied by those lords of the creation {%(lokabhāvanaiḥ)%}
<div n="lb">the {%Pitṛs;%} further {%Śakra,%} with {%Māhendrāṇī,%} mounted on the
<div n="lb">neck of {%Airāvata,%} and surrounded by the gods, and eulogized
<div n="lb">by {%Gandharvas%} and {%ṛṣis.%} Each of them occupied a particular
<div n="lb">summit of {%Himavat%} ({%Yama%} to the south, {%Varuṇa%} to the west).
[Page372-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">They granted him ‘sight’ {%(dṛṣṭi),%} that he might see them.
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} said that {%Arjuna%} would defeat the {%Nivātakavacas,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">and gave him his irresistible staff {%(daṇḍa)%} as a weapon.
<div n="lb">{%Varuṇa (b)%} gave him his irresistible nooses. {%Kubera%} said that
<div n="lb">in bygone {%kalpas Arjuna%} had always gone through ascetic
<div n="lb">austerities along with them, and gave him his favourite
<div n="lb">weapon {%Antardhāna (c). Indra%} said he would descend to
<div n="lb">earth in his chariot with {%Mātali%} as his charioteer, and taking
<div n="lb">him to heaven grant him all his celestial weapons (III, {@41@}).
