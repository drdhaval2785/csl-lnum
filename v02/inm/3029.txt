[{@Dakṣa-yajña-vināśa(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the destruction of
<div n="lb">Dakṣa's sacrifice”). § 695{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): Vaiśampāyana(!)
<div n="lb">said: In days of yore {%Dakṣa%} made arrangements for
<div n="lb">performing a sacrifice on the top of {%Himavat%} in that sacred
<div n="lb">region inhabited by Ṛ. and Si., G. and Aps., where the
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%} issues out of the mountains. The gods, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came
<div n="lb">there. Ṛ. {%Dadhīca%} in wrath and grief said that this was no
<div n="lb">sacrifice, since {%Rudra%} (Śiva) was not adored in it, etc.; he,
<div n="lb">the great {%yogin,%} saw into the future; he beheld {%Śiva%} seated
<div n="lb">with {%Nārada%} and {%Umā. Dakṣa%} said he knew the eleven
<div n="lb">{%Rudras%} with lances and matted locks, but he did not know
<div n="lb">who this {%Maheśvara%} was. {%Dakṣa%} said that he would
<div n="lb">perform the sacrifice unto Viṣṇu. Umā felt grief. {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">said that it is to him as the Lord of Sacrifices that the chanters
<div n="lb">utter their praises in sacrifices, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Then he created
<div n="lb">from his mouth a terrible being (description), and {%Umā%}
<div n="lb">herself, assuming the terrible form of {%Mahākālī,%} proceeded in
<div n="lb">the company of that being, that was the living embodiment
<div n="lb">of {%Śiva's%} wrath and resembled {%Śiva%} himself, and came to be
<div n="lb">called {%Vīrabhadra.%} He then created from the pores of his
<div n="lb">body a large number of spirit-chiefs named {%Raumyas.%} These
<div n="lb">{%Rudras%} attacked the sacrifice (description; Ṛ., D., and men
<div n="lb">looked pale) and began to set fire to everything, and tore off
<div n="lb">the head of the sacrifice. D. and {%Brahmán%} and {%Dakṣa,%}
<div n="lb">informed by {%Vīrabhadra,%} hymned {%Śiva%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who, asked
<div n="lb">by {%Dakṣa,%} granted to him the boon that his sacrificial
<div n="lb">articles should be of use to him. Then Dakṣa knelt
<div n="lb">down and uttered his 1008 names (v. Dakṣa-prokta-
<div n="lb">Śiva-sahasranāmastotra).
