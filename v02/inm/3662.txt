{@[Draupadīharaṇaparvan]@}¦ (“the carrying away of
<div n="lb">Draupadī,” the 46th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf.
<div n="lb">Draupadīharaṇa(ṃ) parva.) § 521: While {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana, Karṇa,%} and {%Śakuni%} were longing to harm
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas, Durvāsas%} arrived with 10,000 disciples, and
<div n="lb">harassed {%Duryodhana%} with his whimsical and insolent
<div n="lb">behaviour; but as {%Duryodhana%} was neither angered nor
<div n="lb">annoyed, he granted him a boon. According to what had
<div n="lb">been agreed upon between himself and {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana,%}
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} asked {%Durvāsas%} to visit the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with his
<div n="lb">disciples, when {%Draupadī,%} after having regaled the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">etc., with food, would have gone to rest. {%Durvāsas%} promised
<div n="lb">to do so (III, {@262@}). Then {%Durvāsas%} one day came to the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} with 10,000 disciples, when the meal was over and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇā%} was reposing. {%Kṛṣṇā%} then praised {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who,
<div n="lb">leaving {%Rūkmiṇī,%} who was sleeping by his side, came to her
<div n="lb">and demanded something to eat. {%Draupadī%} became embarrassed,
<div n="lb">because the sun-given vessel only remained full till she had
<div n="lb">finished her meal, and therefore now was empty. At the
<div n="lb">request of {%Kṛṣṇa%} she, however, fetched the vessel, and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} found a particle of rice and vegetable sticking at its
<div n="lb">rim, and swallowing it he said to her: “May it please the
<div n="lb">god who is the soul of the universe {%(viśvātmā),%} and may the
<div n="lb">partaker of sacrifices {%(yajñabhuk)%} be satisfied.” Then he
<div n="lb">ordered {%Bhīma%} (B. {%Sahadeva%}) to invite the {%munis%} to dinner.
<div n="lb">Meanwhile those ascetics, having bathed in the river,
<div n="lb">observed that their stomachs were full, and as {%Durvāsas%}
<div n="lb">feared that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would destroy them, looking down
<div n="lb">upon them with angry eyes, because the repast had been
<div n="lb">uselessly prepared for them (“I am afraid,” said {%Durvāsas,%}
[Page260-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">“of men that are devoted to {%Hari%}”), they all ran away, so
<div n="lb">that {%Bhīma%} (B. {%Sahadeva%}) sought for them in vain. As the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} were afraid that the {%munis%} might return at night
<div n="lb">and curse them, {%Kṛṣṇa%} suddenly appeared and consoled
<div n="lb">them. Then he repaired to his capital (III, {@263@}).—§ 522:
<div n="lb">One day when the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had gone a-hunting, leaving
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} in the hermitage with the permission of the
<div n="lb">great {%ṛṣi Tṛṇabindu%} and of {%Dhaumya,%} the king of {%Sindhu%}
<div n="lb">(of {%Sauvīra,%} v. 15599; of the {%Śibis, Sauvīras, Sindhus,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">15621), {%Jayadratha Vārddhakṣattri,%} who, with a view of
<div n="lb">matrimony, was on his way to the king of the {%Śālveyas,%} halted
<div n="lb">in the wood of {%Kāmyaka,%} and seeing {%Draupadī%} standing at the
<div n="lb">threshold of the hermitage, he fell in love with her, and sent
<div n="lb">king {%Koṭikāsya%} (king {%Suratha's%} son, v. 15593; the foremost of
<div n="lb">the Śibis, v. 15602) to inquire who she was (III, {@264@}).
<div n="lb">{%Koṭikāsya%} introduced himself to {%Draupadī%} and showed her
<div n="lb">the Trigarta king {%Kṣemaṅkara,%} and the son of the king of
<div n="lb">the {%Kulindas%} (“who always lives in the mountains”), and
<div n="lb">the son of {%Subala%} (B. {%Subhava%}) of the race of {%Ikṣvāku;%} he
<div n="lb">said that {%Jayadratha%} was there at the head of 6,000 chariots,
<div n="lb">etc., followed by twelve {%Sauvīra%} princes as his standard-bearers
<div n="lb">({%Aṅgāraka,%} etc., enumerated) (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and his brothers ({%Balāhaka,%}
<div n="lb">{%Anīka, Vidāraṇa,%} etc.) (III, {@265@}). {%Draupadī%} told {%Koṭikāsya%}
<div n="lb">who she was, and that her husbands were out a-hunting
<div n="lb">({%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to the east, {%Bhīma%} towards the south, {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">to the west, and the {%Aśvins%} towards the north), and invited
<div n="lb">them to alight and await the return of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (III,
<div n="lb">{@266@}). {%Koṭikāsya%} told {%Jayadratha%} the words of {%Draupadī,%}
<div n="lb">and exhorted him to take her with him to the {%Sauvīras.%}
<div n="lb">{%Jayadratha%} introduced himself to {%Draupadī,%} who offered
<div n="lb">him water for washing his feet, and promised him fifty
<div n="lb">animals for breakfast and various kinds of deer, etc., etc.
<div n="lb">(enumerated), when {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} returned. {%Jayadratha%}
<div n="lb">asked her to leave the miserable {%Pāṇḍavas%} and become
<div n="lb">his wife (III, {@267@}), but was severely rebuked by {%Draupadī,%}
<div n="lb">who threatened him with the {%Pāṇḍavas.%} As {%Jayadratha%}
<div n="lb">said, “We too belong by birth to the seventeen high clans,
<div n="lb">and look down upon the {%Pāṇḍavas,%}” she threatened him
<div n="lb">with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna,%} and the {%Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kaikeyas,%} and called upon {%Dhaumya. Jayadratha%} seized her
<div n="lb">by her upper garment; {%Draupadī%} pushed him so that he fell
<div n="lb">upon the ground; but at last she was obliged to ascend his
<div n="lb">chariot, while {%Dhaumya%} followed amidst {%Jayadratha's%} infantry
<div n="lb">(III, {@268@}). When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} again met, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">knew from the shrill cries of the birds that the forest had
<div n="lb">been invaded by hostile intruders, and he caused them to give
<div n="lb">up the chase and drive home on their great chariots drawn
<div n="lb">by {%Saindhava%} horses. A yellow jackal on their left indicated
<div n="lb">the violence done. {%Indrasena%} learned what had happened
<div n="lb">from the weeping foster-sister of {%Draupadī,%} and then they
<div n="lb">pursued and overtook {%Jayadratha,%} who was greatly alarmed
<div n="lb">(III, {@269@}). {%Draupadī,%} asked by {%Jayadratha,%} pointed out
<div n="lb">to him each of the five {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and advised him to
<div n="lb">throw down his arms and seek the protection of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">at the top of whose flagstaff two tabours called {%Nanda%}
<div n="lb">and {%Upananda%} are constantly played. The {%Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb">leaving the panic-stricken infantry alone, rushed upon the
<div n="lb">charioteers [so PCR., who seems to have read {%rathānīkaṃ,%}
<div n="lb">which is, to be sure, the right reading, instead of {%yathānīkaṃ,%}
<div n="lb">which occurs both in C. and B.] (III, {@270@}). {%Bhīma%} with
<div n="lb">his iron mace {%(sarvaśaikyāyasīṃ gadāṃ),%} embossed with gold,
<div n="lb">rushed towards {%Jayadratha,%} who was defended by {%Koṭikāsya.%}
<div n="lb">The {%Trigarta%} king, who had killed the four steeds of
[Page261-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his mace, was himself killed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">who then, together with {%Indrasena,%} mounted the chariot of
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva. Nakula%} killed {%Kṣemaṅkara%} and {%Mahāmukha,%} and
<div n="lb">was compelled by the Trigarta king {%Suratha%} (whom he
<div n="lb">killed?) to mount {%Bhīma's%} chariot. {%Bhīma%} put {%Koṭikāsya%} to
<div n="lb">flight and slew him. {%Arjuna%} killed the twelve {%Sauvīra%}
<div n="lb">heroes, etc.; {%Jayadratha%} put {%Draupadī%} down and fled.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} seeing {%Draupadī%} and {%Dhaumya%} walking in front,
<div n="lb">caused her to be taken up on the chariot of {%Sahadeva.%}
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} advised {%Bhīma%} to refrain from slaying the
<div n="lb">remnant of the {%Saindhava%} host. {%Bhīma%} prevailed upon
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to return to the hermitage with the twins
<div n="lb">and {%Draupadī%} and {%Dhaumya,%} while he himself would
<div n="lb">find out and slay {%Jayadratha. Yudhiṣṭhira%} entreated him
<div n="lb">not to slay him, remembering {%Duḥśalā%} and {%Gāndhārī;%} but
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} indignantly required that he should be slain, and
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} went in search of him. In the hermitage
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} found {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} and many other {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">and ascetics, who were greatly bewailing the lot of {%Draupadī.%}
<div n="lb">Meanwhile {%Arjuna%} killed the horses of {%Jayadratha,%} though
<div n="lb">they were a full {%krośa%} ahead of him. {%Jayadratha%} was then
<div n="lb">overtaken by {%Bhīma,%} but {%Arjuna%} entreated {%Bhīma%} not to kill
<div n="lb">him (III, {@271@}).
