{@[Pañcendropākhyāna(ṃ)]@}¦ (“episode relating to the
<div n="lb">five Indras”). § 238 (cf. Vaivāhikap.): {%Vyāsa%} said to
<div n="lb">{%Drupada:%} In days of yore, when the gods were celebrating
<div n="lb">a great sacrifice in the forest of {%Naimiṣa, Yama,%} holding
<div n="lb">the office of {%śamitṛ,%} did not slay the creatures, so that their
<div n="lb">numbers increased very greatly. {%Soma, Śakra, Varuṇa,%}
[Page528-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Kubera,%} the {%Sādhyas,%} the {%Rudras,%} the {%Vasus,%} the {%Aśvins,%}
<div n="lb">etc., complained thereof to {%Prajāpati,%} who comforted them,
<div n="lb">saying that when the sacrifice was over {%Yama%} would again
<div n="lb">sweep away the inhabitants of the earth. The gods then
<div n="lb">returned to the place of the sacrifice, and saw a golden lotus
<div n="lb">carried along the {%Bhāgīrathī. Indra%} proceeded to the spot
<div n="lb">where the {%Gaṅgā%} issues, and saw a beautiful woman (it
<div n="lb">was {%Śrī%}), whose tears were being transformed into golden
<div n="lb">lotuses. She led him to {%Mahādeva,%} who as a handsome
<div n="lb">youth was seated with a young lady on a throne on one
<div n="lb">of the peaks of the {%Himavat,%} playing dice. When {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">spoke haughtily of himself, {%Mahadeva%} caused {%Śrī%} to paralyse
<div n="lb">him and lead him into a hole, where four {%Indras%} of old
<div n="lb">were confined in order to be reborn in the world of men,
<div n="lb">there to slay a large number of men, and then to regain
<div n="lb">the region of {%Indra.%} Their fathers should be {%Dharma,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vāyu, Maghavat,%} and the {%Aśvins, Indra%} creating a person
<div n="lb">from himself to be the fifth among them. Their names
<div n="lb">were {%Viśvabhuj, Bhūtadhāman, Śibi, Śānti,%} and {%Tejasvin.%}
<div n="lb">The weeping woman {%(Śrī)%} was appointed to be their
<div n="lb">common wife in the world of men. {%Nārāyaṇa,%} to whom {%Īśāna%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Śiva%}) and the five {%Indras%} repaired, approved of every-
<div n="lb">thing. The five {%Indras%} were reborn as the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Śrī%} as {%Draupadī.%} A white hair of {%Nārāyaṇa's%} became {%Bala-%}
<div n="lb">{%deva,%} and a black {%Kṛṣṇa,%} after having entered the wombs
<div n="lb">of {%Devakī%} and {%Rohiṇī.%} Having related this to {%Drupada, Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">granted him celestial sight, so that he beheld the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">endued with their former bodies.—§ 239: {%Vyāsa%} then related
<div n="lb">to {%Drupada%} the story of the damsel {%(= Śrī = Kṛṣṇā)%} whom
<div n="lb">{%Śaṅkara,%} i.e. {%Śiva,%} appointed to be in a future birth the
<div n="lb">wife of five husbands (see § 220) (I, {@197@}).
