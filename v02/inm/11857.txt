[{@Vicitravīryasutotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“begetting of sons for
<div n="lb">Vicitravīrya”). § 171 (cf. Bhīṣma-Satyavatī-saṃvāda).
<div n="lb">{%Satyavatī%} related to {%Bhīṣma%} the birth of {%Dvaipāyana%}
<div n="lb">(cf. § 77; from the darkness of his skin he is also called
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} (v. 4236)), who instantly came when {%Kālī%} (i.e. Satya-
<div n="lb">vatī) thought of him, and promised to raise offspring in the
<div n="lb">widows of {%Vicitravīrya.%} As there was no time for them to
<div n="lb">observe a rigid vow for one full year, he ordered that they
<div n="lb">should tolerate his ugliness. {%Satyavatī%} first addressed herself
<div n="lb">to {%Kausalyā%} (i.e. Ambikā) and fed {%brahmans, devarṣis,%} and
<div n="lb">guests (I, {@105@}). {%Ambikā,%} seeing {%Vyāsa,%} closed her eyes in
<div n="lb">fear; therefore her son, though he was destined to be mighty,
<div n="lb">etc., and to have 100 sons, had to be blind. After his
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}) birth, {%Vyāsa%} approached {%Ambālikā,%} who
<div n="lb">became pale with fear; therefore, her son was pale and was
<div n="lb">named {%Pāṇḍu. Ambālikā%} refused to receive {%Vyāsa%} again and
<div n="lb">sent him a {%śūdra%} maid of hers, adorned with her own
<div n="lb">ornaments; on her he begat {%Vidura,%} who was {%Dharma,%} born
<div n="lb">under the curse of {%Māṇḍavya. Vyāsa%} then disappeared
<div n="lb">(I, {@106@}).
