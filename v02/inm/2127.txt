{@Citrāṅgadopākhyāna(ṃ),@}¦ “episode relating to Cit-
<div n="lb">rāṅgada.” § 166 (cf. Satyavatīlābhop.): I, {@101.@} Two
<div n="lb">sons were born of {%Satyavatī, Citrāṅgada%} and {%Vicitravīrya.%}
<div n="lb">Before the last had attained to majority, {%Śāntanu%} died and
<div n="lb">ascended to heaven, {%Bhīṣma%} placed {%Citrāṅgada%} on the
<div n="lb">throne. {%Citrāṅgada%} considered nobody his equal, not even
<div n="lb">the gods and {%Asuras.%} Therefore the king of the {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">bearing the same name fought a three years' battle with him at
<div n="lb">{%Kurukṣetra%} on the banks of the {%Sarasvatī,%} where {%Citrāṅgada%}
<div n="lb">was slain; then the {%Gandharva%} ascended to heaven. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">installed {%Vicitravīrya,%} yet in his minority, on the throne
<div n="lb">of the {%Kurus%} and ruled for him. (For continuation
<div n="lb">v. Vicitravīryop.)
