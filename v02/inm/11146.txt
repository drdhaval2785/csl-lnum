[{@Uñchavṛtty-upākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
<div n="lb">to the gleaner”). § 718{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">M-ṛ {%Nārada%} wanders through all the worlds like {%Vāyu,%}
<div n="lb">not obstructed by anything; once he repaired to the abode of
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} who asked him if he had perceived any wonderful
<div n="lb">incident. {%Nārada%} recited the following story (XII, {@353@}):
<div n="lb">In the town of {%Mahāpadma,%} on the southern bank of the
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā,%} there lived a brahman of the {%Soma-%}lineage ({%Somānvaye,%}
<div n="lb">i.e. {%Atrigotre,%} Nīl.), endued with amiability, etc.; he was in
<div n="lb">great trouble with regard to the value of following the
<div n="lb">ordinances of the {%Vedas,%} or the {%[Dharma]śāstras,%} or the
<div n="lb">duties that eminent men of former times have performed
<div n="lb">{%(śiṣṭācīrṇa).%} Then there came to him a wise brahman as a
<div n="lb">guest (XII, {@354@}); him he asked what he, having entrusted
<div n="lb">his duties as a householder to his son, should do in order to
<div n="lb">perform the highest duty of men, as he had no respect for
<div n="lb">the religion of the {%Yatis,%} who depend upon alms. The guest
<div n="lb">said that he was himself perplexed, as heaven had many
<div n="lb">doors (examples) (XII, {@355@}); he told him (according to
<div n="lb">what he learnt from his preceptor) to repair to {%Padma,%} the
<div n="lb">righteous {%Nāga,%} who lived in the city called after the {%Nāgas%}
<div n="lb">in the {%Naimiṣa%} forest, on the banks of the {%Gomatī,%} whence,
<div n="lb">in a former creation {%(pūrvābhisarge)%} the wheel of righteous-
<div n="lb">ness was set in motion {%(dharmacakraṃ pravartitaṃ),%} and
<div n="lb">where all the gods had, in days of old, performed a great
<div n="lb">sacrifice, and where king {%Māndhātṛ%} neglected {%(atikramañ%}
<div n="lb">{%cakre) Indra%} (XII, {@356@}). The host became delighted, and
<div n="lb">passed the night happily conversing with his guest about the
<div n="lb">fourth mode of life {%(caturthadharma)%} [i.e. {%sannyāsa,%} renuncia-
<div n="lb">tion, PCR.; = {%mokṣadharma,%} Nīl.]; the next morning, having
<div n="lb">dismissed his guest, he set out for the abode of the {%Nāga%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@357@}), was shown the way by an ascetic, and received
<div n="lb">by the beautiful wife of the {%Nāga;%} as the {%Nāga%} had gone to
<div n="lb">draw the chariot of {%Sūrya%} for a month, and would be back in
<div n="lb">seven or eight days, he passed this time on the banks of the
<div n="lb">{%Gomalī%} (XII, {@358@}). On the 6th day the {%Nāgas%} of the city,
<div n="lb">seeing him abstaining from food and [only] reciting {%mantras,%}
<div n="lb">came and asked him to eat; but he wanted to keep his fast for
<div n="lb">eight days; if then the {%Nāga%}-chief had not come back, he
<div n="lb">would break his fast. Then the {%Nāgas%} returned (XII, {@359@}).
<div n="lb">When the {%Nāga%}-chief came home, he was informed by his
<div n="lb">wife about the brahman's arrival (XII, {@360@}). The {%Nāga%}
<div n="lb">doubted whether that brahman was a human being, as the
<div n="lb">{%Nāgas,%} even by D., As., and D-ṛ, are considered to be endued
<div n="lb">with great energy; his wife told him to go and speak to the
<div n="lb">guest without the wrath which is natural to {%Nāgas;%} the
<div n="lb">{%Nāga%} himself also blamed wrath, citing {%Rāvaṇa%} (who became
<div n="lb">the rival of {%Śakra%} and was slain by {%Rāma%}) and the sons
<div n="lb">of {%Kārtavīrya%} (who were slain by {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}) and
<div n="lb">{%Kārtavīrya%} himself (XII, {@361@}). The {%Nāga%} met with the
[Page691-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">brahman (who characterized himself as a righteous being
<div n="lb">({%dharmāraṇya = muni,%} Nīl.)) on the banks of the {%Gomatī,%}
<div n="lb">engaged in Yoga and reciting the {%Vedas%} in order to dispel all
<div n="lb">evil from the {%Nāga%} (XII, {@362@}); he asked the {%Nāga%} whether
<div n="lb">he had seen anything wonderful in those regions where he had
<div n="lb">drawn the one-wheeled chariot of {%Vivasvat.%} The {%Nāga%}
<div n="lb">described the wonders of which the Sun is the source (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">The most wonderful was that one day, in former times, at the
<div n="lb">hour of noon, a being came through the sky like a second
<div n="lb">sun and entered {%Sūrya%} (XII, {@363@}). {%Sūrya%} declared it to be
<div n="lb">a brahman, who had attained to heaven on account of his
<div n="lb">having been crowned with success {%(siddhaḥ)%} in the
<div n="lb">gleaning-vow {%(uñchavṛttivrate)%} (description), and because
<div n="lb">he had gratified {%Bhava%} (Śiva) by praising him with
<div n="lb">{%saṃhitāḥ,%} and now he “goes round the earth staying in the
<div n="lb">disc of {%Sūrya;%} neither D., nor G., As., nor Pn. are superior
<div n="lb">to those creatures that attain to this excellent end” (XII,
<div n="lb">{@364@}). The brahman then betook himself formally to the
<div n="lb">practice of the {%uñcha%}-vow (XII, {@365@}), and having saluted
<div n="lb">the {%Nāga,%} he went to {%Cyavana Bhārgava,%} who initiated him
<div n="lb">and recited the story of the brahman in king {%Janaka's%} palace
<div n="lb">to D-ṛ. {%Nārada > Indra >%} the foremost brahmans. “During
<div n="lb">my (i.e. Bhīṣma's) battle with {%Rāma,%} the {%Vasus%} told it to
<div n="lb">me.” The brahman proceeded to another forest (XII, {@366@}).
