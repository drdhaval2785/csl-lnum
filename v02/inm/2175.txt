[{@Cyavanopākhyāna(ṃ)@}],¦ “the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Cyavana.” § 745{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days
<div n="lb">past M.-ṛ. {%Cyavana Bhārgava%} set himself for twelve years to
<div n="lb">{%udavāsa%} (“dwelling in water”) at the confluence {%(madhye)%} of
<div n="lb">the {%Gaṅgā%} and {%Yamunā,%} and stood there like a wooden post
<div n="lb">(description). He was caught in the net (description) of
<div n="lb">some fishers {%(kaivartāḥ)%} along with a large number of fish,
<div n="lb">etc. They were afraid; {%Cyavana%} said that he would either
<div n="lb">die with the fishes or be sold with them. With pale faces
<div n="lb">the fishers repaired to king {%Nahuṣa%} (XIII, {@50@}), who
<div n="lb">immediately went to {%Cyavana%} with his ministers and priest;
<div n="lb">{%Cyavana%} asked him to pay the price for himself and the
<div n="lb">fishes; {%Nahuṣa%} ordered large sums to be paid to the {%Niṣādas%}
<div n="lb">for {%Cyavana;%} but the latter declared that these could not
<div n="lb">represent his price, even his whole kingdom; {%Nahuṣa%}
<div n="lb">deliberated with his ministers and priests; then there came
<div n="lb">an ascetic living in the woods, born of a cow, and said that
<div n="lb">the cow was equal in value to the {%brahman;%} this {%Cyavana%}
<div n="lb">approved of, as {%svāhā-%} and {%vaṣaṭ-kāra%} are always established
[Page180-b+ 55]
<div n="lb">upon kine, etc. {%Cyavana%} accepted the cow from the fisher-
<div n="lb">men, and caused them along with the fishes to proceed to
<div n="lb">heaven. The two Ṛ. gladdened king {%Nahuṣa%} by granting him
<div n="lb">many boons; he accepted the boon that he should himself
<div n="lb">remain firm in virtue. The two Ṛ. returned each to his own
<div n="lb">asylum, and {%Nahuṣa%} to his city (XIII, {@51@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about {%Rāma Jāmadagnya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">recited an old history of the discourse between {%Cyavana%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kuśika,%} i.e. Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda {%(c)%} (III, {@52—56@}).
