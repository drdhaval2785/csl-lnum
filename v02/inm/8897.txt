{@[Rājadharmānuśāsanaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the section
<div n="lb">containing the teaching of the duties of kings,” the
<div n="lb">88th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Rājadharmānu-
<div n="lb">śāsana). § 621: After the completion of the water rites
<div n="lb">by the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), many {%Brahmarṣis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came
<div n="lb">to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Nārada%} congratulated {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} upon
<div n="lb">his success. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} lamented the loss of his kinsmen
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yudhiṣthira%} at the match of dice had wondered seeing
<div n="lb">that {%Karṇa's%} feet resembled the feet of {%Kuntī;%} he inquired
<div n="lb">of {%Nārada,%} why the earth had swallowed up the wheels of
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa's%} chariot (XII, {@1@}). {%Nārada%} recited to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the
<div n="lb">story of {%Kaṛna's%} pupilage with {%Droṇa%} and {%Rāma%} (among G., Rā.,
<div n="lb">Y., and D.) and the curse called down upon him by a brahman
<div n="lb">whose cow {%Karṇa%} had inadvertently slain (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@2@});
<div n="lb">then the story of {%Karṇa's%} extraordinary powers of endurance,
<div n="lb">in consequence of which his real caste became known to
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} (who had taught him the {%Brāhma%} weapon), who there-
<div n="lb">upon cursed him for his deceit; the worm {%Alarka%} was
<div n="lb">an Asura named {%Daṃśa,%} who in the {%Kṛta%} age had ravished
<div n="lb">the spouse of {%Bhṛgu%} and been cursed by him, until he should be
<div n="lb">liberated by {%Paraśu-Rāma. Karṇa,%} arriving before {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana,%} told him: “I have mastered every weapon” (XII, {@3@}).
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} said: “To a self-choice at {%Rājapura,%} the capital of
<div n="lb">the {%Kāliṅga%} king {%Citrāṅgada Duryodhana%} (with {%Karṇa%}),
<div n="lb">{%Śiśupāla,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), repaired; the maiden (who was accompanied
<div n="lb">by her nurse and a guard of eunuchs) passed by {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">who then (relying upon {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}) took her up on
<div n="lb">his chariot and abducted her by force. {%Karṇa,%} riding on
<div n="lb">his chariot, proceeded in {%Duryodhana's%} rear. The kings
<div n="lb">pursued {%Karṇa%} and {%Duryodhana;%} but {%Karṇa%} made them all
<div n="lb">turn away, and {%Duryodhana%} reached {%Hāstinapura%} with
<div n="lb">the maiden” (XII, {@4@}). {%Nārada%} said: “The {%Māgadha%} king
<div n="lb">{%Jarāsandha%} challenged {%Karṇa%} to a single combat; at last they
<div n="lb">fought with bare arms, and {%Karṇa%} was about to sever the
<div n="lb">two portions of {%Jarāsandha's%} body that had been united
<div n="lb">together by {%Jarā;%} then {%Jarāsandha%} gave up all desire of
<div n="lb">hostility and gave unto {%Karṇa%} the town {%Mālinī%} (i.e. {%Campā%}).
<div n="lb">From that time he ruled over {%Campā%} and the {%Aṅgas%} agreeably
<div n="lb">to the wishes of {%Duryodhana.%}” Allusions to XII, {@2, 3,@} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@5@}). D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} became silent; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">grieved; {%Kuntī%} comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by telling him that
<div n="lb">neither she nor {%Sūrya%} could dissuade {%Karṇa%} from fighting
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (XII, {@6@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} lament (<lang n="greek"></lang>) before
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna;%} he wished to renounce the sovereignty (XII, {@7@}).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} justifying war and approving
<div n="lb">of the acquisition of wealth, quoting {%Nahuṣa%} (who cried
<div n="lb">fie on the state of poverty, in which he had done many
<div n="lb">wicked acts, and which is for recluses and {%Ṛ.%}), and citing
<div n="lb">the conduct of the gods and Dā., which is sanctioned by the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas;%} “this earth formerly belonged to king {%Dilīpa,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); she now belongs to thee; a great sacrifice awaits thee;
<div n="lb">if thou dost not perform this sacrifice, the sins of this kingdom
<div n="lb">shall all be thine; those subjects whose king performs
<div n="lb">a horse-sacrifice…all become pure,” as shown by the
<div n="lb">example of {%Mahādeva (Śiva (b));%} “this is the great path
<div n="lb">called {%Dāśaratha%} (affording place for ten waggons, i.e. the
<div n="lb">sacrifice [Nīl.])” (XII, {@8@}). Unmoved by {%Arjuna's%} words,
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} desired to lead the life of a religious recluse
<div n="lb">(XII, {@9@}). {%Bhīma's%} address to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} commending
<div n="lb">sovereignty (XII, {@10@}).—§ 622: {%Arjuna%} recited the story of
<div n="lb">the discourse between {%Śakra%} (in the shape of a golden bird) and
[Page575-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">certain youths (Ṛ.) desirous of leading a forest life (XII, {@11@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 623: {%Nakula%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} blaming renunci-
<div n="lb">ation and commending the life of a householder (XII, {@12@}).
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva%} recommended to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} a life of action with
<div n="lb">the soul free from attachments (XII, {@13@}). {%Draupadī%} reminded
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of his former counsels (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@14@}). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">praised him who wields the rod of chastisement; “{%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">by the slaughter of {%Vṛtra,%} became the great {%Indra;%} those
<div n="lb">among the gods that are given to slaughtering others are
<div n="lb">adored much more by men; {%Rudra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) are all slaughterers;
<div n="lb">all people bend to these gods, but not to {%Brahmán%} or {%Dhātṛ%}
<div n="lb">or {%Pūṣan%} at any time, except a few men of noble disposition”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@15@}). {%Bhīma's%} second address to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), urging
<div n="lb">him to subdue his grief (XII, {@16@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} exposed
<div n="lb">the folly of earthly enjoyments quoting {%Janaka%} (observant of
<div n="lb">the religion of {%mokṣa%}): “my treasures are immense; yet
<div n="lb">I possess nothing; if again the whole of {%Mithilā%} were burnt,
<div n="lb">nothing of mine will be burnt” (XII, {@17@}).—§ 624: {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">recited the story of the discourse between the {%Videha%} king
<div n="lb">{%Janaka%} (who had shaved his head) and his queen (the
<div n="lb">princess of {%Kośala%}), in which the latter explained the claims of
<div n="lb">a life of poverty and renunciation (XII, {@18@}).—§ 625: {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira's%} reply to {%Arjuna%} on the vanity of wealth (XII, {@19@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 626: {%Devasthāna%} pointed out to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that the
<div n="lb">period had not come when he could retire into the woods
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@20@}), and recommended the assumption of sovereignty
<div n="lb">with his soul freed from attachment, quoting a discourse which
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} delivered to {%Indra;%} the Ṛ., etc., adopt the religion
<div n="lb">of Exertion (not Emancipation), and attain to heaven through
<div n="lb">their acts (XII, {@21@}).—§ 627: {%Arjuna%} justified before {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} the slaughter of foes in battle: “{%Indra,%} himself,
<div n="lb">though a brahman, became a {%kṣatriya%} in his acts, and battled
<div n="lb">with his sinful kinsfolk 810 times” (XII, {@22@}).—§ 628:
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} dissuaded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} from a life of retirement and
<div n="lb">commended a life of domesticity, quoting a verse of {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">(“like a snake devouring mice, the Earth devours a king that
<div n="lb">is inclined to peace and a {%brahman%} that is exceedingly attached
<div n="lb">to domesticity”), and reciting the story of R.-ṛ. {%Sudyumna:%}
<div n="lb">the brothers {%Śaṅkha%} and {%Likhita%} dwelled in two separate
<div n="lb">dwellings on the banks of {%Bāhudā;%} once, when {%Śaṅkha%} had
<div n="lb">gone out, {%Likhita%} came to his asylum and ate many ripe
<div n="lb">fruits. {%Śaṅkha%} told him to confess to the king and ask him
<div n="lb">to inflict on him the punishment of a thief. King {%Sudyumna%}
<div n="lb">would pardon him; but {%Likhita%} would not; {%Sudyumna%} then
<div n="lb">caused his hands to be cut off; {%Likhita,%} having asked pardon
<div n="lb">of {%Śaṅkha,%} was told by him to gratify D., Ṛ., and P. at
<div n="lb">{%Bāhudā,%} upon which two hands grew out. {%Śaṅkha%} said that
<div n="lb">he was not his chastiser, “but the king has been himself
<div n="lb">purified, as also thyself, along with P.” That king became
<div n="lb">eminent by this act and obtained the highest success (XII,
<div n="lb">{@23@}). {%Vyāsa%} exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to grant the wishes of
<div n="lb">his brothers, perform sacrifices, and imitate the great monarchs
<div n="lb">of old, especially {%Hayagrīva (b)%} (XII, {@24@}).—§ 629: Hearing
<div n="lb">the words of {%Vyāsa%} and seeing {%Arjuna%} angry, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">declared to {%Vyāsa%} that earthly rule could give him no
<div n="lb">delight. {%Vyāsa%} answered, pointing out the virtues of Time,
<div n="lb">quoting “the old story recited by king {%Senajit%} in grief”.
<div n="lb">“Engaging in battle has been said to be the sacrifice for
<div n="lb">a king; a due observance of the science of chastisement is
<div n="lb">his {%yoga;%} and the gift of wealth in sacrifices in the shape of
<div n="lb">{%dakṣiṇā%} is his renunciation; all this should be regarded as
<div n="lb">acts that sanctify him” (XII, {@25@}).—§ 630: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">reply to {%Arjuna%} recommending a life of {%yoga%} and austerities;
[Page576-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">this is the practice of R., regarded by D. as {%brahmans;%} this is
<div n="lb">the opinion of the {%Vaikhānasas;%} the {%Ajāḥ,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) have all
<div n="lb">gone to heaven by means of {%Vedic%} study; by performing
<div n="lb">the acts indicated in the {%Vedas,%} battle, sacrifices, study of the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas,%} restrainment of passion, one goes to heaven by the
<div n="lb">southern path of the Sun; the northern path is travelled by
<div n="lb">those devoted to {%yoga,%} and is much applauded by those
<div n="lb">conversant with the {%Purāṇas;%} “one acquires heaven through
<div n="lb">contentment,” citing the discourse of {%Yayāti%} of old (XII,
<div n="lb">{@26@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} censured himself for his cupidity and
<div n="lb">for the slaughter he caused of his kinsmen (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bhīṣma%} had,
<div n="lb">by the energy of his weapons, burnt {%Ugrāyudha,%} etc.; {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by explaining the action of Destiny,
<div n="lb">and exhorted him to work (XII, {@27@}).—§ 631: {%Vyāsa%} recited
<div n="lb">“the old story, that is known by the name of {%Aśman's%}
<div n="lb">discourse”: the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka,%} filled with sorrow,
<div n="lb">questioned the wise {%brahman Aśman%} as to how a man should
<div n="lb">behave upon occasions of the accession and the destruction
<div n="lb">of both kinsmen and wealth. {%Aśman%} said that Destiny and
<div n="lb">Time are inevitable; “no person can see either heaven or
<div n="lb">hell; the scriptures, however, are the eyes of the virtuous;
<div n="lb">frame thy conduct according to the scriptures.” {%Janaka%}
<div n="lb">became freed from grief; “enjoy the earth, O son of {%Kuntī!%}”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@28@}).—§ 632: {%Arjuna%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} (who from his
<div n="lb">earliest years was dearer to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} than even {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">himself) to dispel {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} grief. {%Kṛṣṇa%} asked {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} not to grieve for men who died heroically in battle in
<div n="lb">the observance of {%kṣatriya%} duties, quoting the {%Ṣoḍaśarājopā-%}
<div n="lb">{%khyāna (b),%} i.e. the old discourse of {%Nārada%} before {%Sṛñjaya%}
<div n="lb">when the latter was deeply afflicted with grief on account of
<div n="lb">the death of his son. {%Sṛñjaya%} was freed from grief, and
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} gave back to him his son {%Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin,%} whom
<div n="lb">{%Parvata%} had given him, and who had been bereft of life; that
<div n="lb">child should live 1,000 years (XII, {@29@}).—§ 633: Requested
<div n="lb">by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa%} told {%Nārada-Parvatopākhyāna (b)%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@30@}).—§ 634: Thereafter {%Nārada%} told {%Suvarṇasṭhīvi-%}
<div n="lb">{%sambhavopākhyāna (b)%} (XII, {@31@}).—§ 635: {%Vyāsa%} exhorted
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to shake off his grief and assume the reins of
<div n="lb">sovereignty. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} feared that the guilt of slaughter
<div n="lb">had stained him; {%Vyāsa%} repeated his observations on Destiny
<div n="lb">(XII, {@32@}); as {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} still was remorseful (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">repeated his observations on Time, and pointed to expiatory
<div n="lb">rites, illustrating the case by the war of 32,000 years, by which
<div n="lb">the gods, having slain Dai., gained possession of heaven, and
<div n="lb">slew 88,000 brahmans called {%Śālāvṛkāḥ%} who had joined the
<div n="lb">Dā.; “thou hast only followed the path formerly trodden
<div n="lb">by the very gods; men like you never go to hell.” He
<div n="lb">recommended a horse-sacrifice as an expiation, mentioning
<div n="lb">that {%Indra,%} assisted by the {%Maruts,%} gradually performed
<div n="lb">100 sacrifices and became {%Śatakratu,%} and is adored in the
<div n="lb">heavens by Aps., Ṛ., and D. (XII, {@33@}). {%Vyāsa%} discoursed
<div n="lb">on expiation and indicated the acts for which there should be
<div n="lb">expiation, citing the sage {%Uddālaka,%} who caused his son
<div n="lb">{%Śvetaketu%} to be begotten by disciple, etc. (XII, {@34@}), and
<div n="lb">declared that by penances, religious rites, and gifts one may
<div n="lb">wash off sins if one does not commit them anew, and indicated
<div n="lb">diverse kinds of expiation for diverse kinds of sins (XII, {@35@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} declared what food is clean
<div n="lb">and what is unclean (XII, {@36@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} desired to
<div n="lb">hear of the duties of kings and of the four different orders.
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa,%} casting his eyes on {%Nārada,%} directed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
<div n="lb">apply to {%Bhīṣma%} for discourses on kingly duties, as {%Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">having gratified D.-ṛ. with Bṛh, at their head, had acquired
[Page576-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">a knowledge of the duties of kings, and of that science, with
<div n="lb">its interpretations, that {%Uśanas%} and {%Bṛhaspati%} know; and
<div n="lb">a knowledge of all the {%Vedas%} with their branches, from
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha%} and {%Cyavana%} of {%Bhṛgu's%} race; in olden days he
<div n="lb">studied under {%Sanatkumāra%} (the eldest-born son of {%Brahmán%});
<div n="lb">he learned the duties of the {%Yatis%} from {%Mārkaṇḍeya;%} and
<div n="lb">obtained all weapons from {%Rāma%} and {%Indra;%} although childless,
<div n="lb">yet he has many regions of bliss before himself; B.-ṛ. were
<div n="lb">always his courtiers. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was ashamed to approach
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma. Kṛṣṇa%} exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to rise up, shaking
<div n="lb">off his grief (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Thus addressed by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} gave up his grief and anxiety, and with his brothers
<div n="lb">and the other kings, headed by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} set out for
<div n="lb">{%Hāstinapura.%} The procession described (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@37@}). The
<div n="lb">citizens welcomed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Draupadī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} entered the palace with {%Dhaumya%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">and was blessed by the {%brahmans,%} but cursed by {%Cārvāka,%} a Rā.
<div n="lb">who had disguised himself as a {%brahman,%} and a friend of
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana;%} the {%brahmans%} killed {%Cārvāka%} by uttering the
<div n="lb">mere sound {%huṃ%} (XII, {@38@}).—§ 636: {%Kṛṣṇa%} related: In the
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta%} age Rā. {%Cārvāka%} performed penances in {%Badarī;%} at last
<div n="lb">he solicited from {%Brahmán%} the boon of immunity from fear at
<div n="lb">the hands of every being in the universe, which {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">granted him, only with the limitation that he should be
<div n="lb">careful not to offend {%brahmans.%} Then he began to cause
<div n="lb">trouble to the gods; {%Brahmán%} predicted {%Cārvāka's%} friendship
<div n="lb">with {%Duryodhana,%} and that he would insult the {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@39@}).—§ 637: The ceremony of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">installation on the throne described (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he made gifts to the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} who all blessed him and his brothers (XII, {@40@}).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} answered and enjoined respect for his aged
<div n="lb">uncle, disposed of the high appointments of state (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII,
<div n="lb">{@41@}), and caused the obsequial rites {%(śrāddha)%} to be performed
<div n="lb">in honour of the slaughtered heroes (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and performed acts of
<div n="lb">kindness to the ladies, widowed in the battle, the destitute,
<div n="lb">the blind, and helpless (XII, {@42@}). Then he adored {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@43@}), and assigned to his brothers proper residences
<div n="lb">from among the palaces of the {%Kuru%} princes slain in battle
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>). They passed a happy night in their respective abodes,
<div n="lb">and in the morning presented themselves before king
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (XII, {@44@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} gifts to diverse
<div n="lb">persons (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Then he addressed {%Kṛṣṇa%} (with the {%Kaustubha%}),
<div n="lb">whom he found rapt in meditation (XII, {@45@}); he uttered
<div n="lb">a hymn to {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who awoke and praised {%Bhīṣma%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">asking {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to resort to {%Bhīṣma%} for instruction.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} requested {%Kṛṣṇa%} to grant {%Bhīṣma%} the sight of
<div n="lb">his divine person. {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused {%Sātyaki%} to let {%Dāruka%} yoke
<div n="lb">his chariot with {%Sugrīva%} and {%Śaibya,%} etc. (XII, {@46@}). Descrip-
<div n="lb">tion of the bed of arrows on which {%Bhīṣma%} lay, surrounded by
<div n="lb">Ṛ. {%Vyāsa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Bhīṣma%} hymned {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">moved by {%Bhīṣma's%} adorations, bestowed upon him heavenly
<div n="lb">knowledge compassing the Past, the Present, and the Future,
<div n="lb">and went away. Those holy brahmans adored {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛṣṇa.%} Seeing the devotion of {%Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">suddenly rose from his seat and ascended his chariot with
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki; Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna%} mounted another; {%Bhīmasena%}
<div n="lb">and the twins a third; {%Kṛpa, Yuyutsu,%} and {%Sañjaya%} on
<div n="lb">their respective chariots (XII, {@47@}).—§ 638: Then {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), proceeded to {%Kurukṣetra%} (description). {%Kṛṣṇa%} pointed
<div n="lb">out to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the five lakes of {%Rāma Bhārgava.%}
<div n="lb">Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (XII, {@48@}), {%Kṛṣṇa%} related:
<div n="lb">{%Rāmopākhyāna (b).%} Then he proceeded quietly in his
<div n="lb">chariot (XII, {@49@}).—§ 639: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} eulogy of {%Rāma%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
[Page577-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Beholding from a distance the spot on which {%Bhīṣma%} lay
<div n="lb">(on the banks of the river {%Oghavatī%}), {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">descended from their chariots and approached and saluted
<div n="lb">the Ṛ. (headed by {%Vyāsa%}). Seeing {%Bhīṣma%} on the point of
<div n="lb">death, {%Kṛṣṇa%} addressed him kindly (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and eulogized him
<div n="lb">(“competent to subjugate D., G., As., Y., and Rā.; spoken
<div n="lb">of by {%brahmans%} as the ninth of the {%Vasus;%} knowing the
<div n="lb">knowledge of the {%cāturhotra%}—v. BR.—and the {%Sāṅkhya%}
<div n="lb">and {%Yoga,%} etc., the {%Vedas%} and the {%Purāṇas%}”) (XII, {@50@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} saluted {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and beheld his eternal form.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said that it was owing to {%Bhīṣma's%} devotion that he
<div n="lb">had displayed his celestial form to him; “those regions,
<div n="lb">O king! are ready for thee whence there is no return;
<div n="lb">fifty-six days still remain for thee to live; when {%Sūrya%} turns
<div n="lb">to his northerly course, you shall go there; D. and V., riding
<div n="lb">on their chariots, are waiting for thee invisibly.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} to instruct {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc.; “when thou wilt leave
<div n="lb">this world for that, all knowledge will expire with thee”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@51@}). {%Bhīṣma%} alleged physical weakness and mental
<div n="lb">darkness as reasons for his inability to obey {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and he
<div n="lb">also hesitated to speak in {%Kṛṣṇa's%} presence. {%Kṛṣṇa%} removed
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} pain and granted him power to recollect everything
<div n="lb">and behold the universe like a fish in a limpid stream. M.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">with {%Vyāsa%} adored {%Kṛṣṇa%} with words, accompanied by
<div n="lb">{%Ṛc, Yojus,%} and {%Sāman%} verses; celestial flowers fell, and Aps.
<div n="lb">sang, etc. At sunset the M.-ṛ., rising up, saluted {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} Upon this, {%Kṛṣṇa%} (etc.) (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">returned to {%Hāstinapura,%} after having saluted {%Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">saying that they would return next day (description)

<div n="lb">apprised him of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} readiness to accompany him into the
<div n="lb">presence of {%Bhīṣma. Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Arjuna%} to see that
<div n="lb">his chariot was made ready; then he, with the twins, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), proceeded to {%Kṛṣṇa's%} abode. {%Kṛṣṇa,%} accompanied by

<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), urged by {%Dāruka.%} The princes set out. Arrived near
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} (surrounded by M.-ṛ.), {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), alighting
<div n="lb">from their chariots, saluted Ṛ. by raising their right hands.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} approached {%Bhīṣma,%} eying him timidly (XII,
<div n="lb">{@53@}).—§ 640: Many Ṛ. and Sā., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came to {%Bhīṣma.%}
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} urged the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to take advantage of the short
<div n="lb">span of life still left to {%Bhīṣma%} for soliciting him to discourse
<div n="lb">on morality. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} requested {%Kṛṣṇa%} to put questions
<div n="lb">to {%Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma's%} cheerful answer. He enquired of
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} why he was desired to discourse on morality and the
<div n="lb">duties of kings, {%Kṛṣṇa's%} divine self being best fitted to do so;
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} explained that his motive was only the enhancement
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīṣma's%} glory; “thou hast always worshipped Ṛ. and
<div n="lb">D.” (XII, {@54@}). {%Bhīṣma%} consented to discourse on morality
<div n="lb">and duty, and desired {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to question him. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">introduced {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to {%Bhīṣma,%} who comforted {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira,%} saying that what he had done he had done in
<div n="lb">observance of {%kṣatriya%} duties. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} humbly
<div n="lb">approached {%Bhīṣma%} and touched his feet; {%Bhīṣma,%} kissing
<div n="lb">his head, asked him to take a seat and question him without
<div n="lb">anxiety (XII, {@55@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} solicited {%Bhīṣma%} to
<div n="lb">discourse on kingly duties which are regarded as the root of
<div n="lb">all other duties in the world. {%Bhīṣma,%} bowing to {%Dharma,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} (who is {%Bráhman%} in full), and the {%brahmans,%} set forth
<div n="lb">the general duties of kings (“as regards Ṛ. also, truth is
<div n="lb">their great wealth”); he quoted two {%ślokas%} of {%Manu:%} “fire
[Page577-b+ 61]
<div n="lb">has sprung from water, the {%kṣatriya%} from the {%brahman,%} and
<div n="lb">iron from stone; these three can exert their force on every
<div n="lb">other thing; but on their origins {%(yoniṣu),%} it is extinguished
<div n="lb">{%(śāmyati)%}”; and two {%ślokas%} of M.-ṛ. {%Uśanas%} (a {%brahman%} who
<div n="lb">rushes to battle may be chastised by a {%kṣatriya%}); and
<div n="lb">a {%śloka%} of {%Bṛhaspati%} (according to B.) (a king should not
<div n="lb">always be mild, nor always fierce) (XII, {@56@}). Continuation
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse, enjoining readiness for action on
<div n="lb">kings; quoting a {%śloka%} sung by {%Uśanas%} (“like a snake
<div n="lb">swallowing up mice”; cf. ch. {@23@}); and one by king
<div n="lb">{%Marutta,%} agreeably to {%Bṛhaspati's%} opinion; {%Bāhu's%} son, king
<div n="lb">{%Sagara,%} who exiled his eldest son {%Asamañjas,%} who used to
<div n="lb">drown the children of the citizens in the {%Sarayū;%} Ṛ. {%Uddālaka%}
<div n="lb">who cast off his favourite son {%Śvetaketu,%} because the latter
<div n="lb">used to invite {%brahmans%} with deceptive promises of entertain-
<div n="lb">ment. The king should administer justice like {%Yama%} and
<div n="lb">amass wealth like {%Kubera.%} He quoted a verse sung in days
<div n="lb">of old by {%Bhārgava%} [i.e. {%Vālmīki%} (cf. Hopkins, p. 61)], in the
<div n="lb">narrative called {%Rāmacarita,%} on king[ly duties] (“one should
<div n="lb">first select a king; then should he select a wife, and then
<div n="lb">earn wealth; if there be no king, what would become of
<div n="lb">his wife and acquisitions?” (XII, {@57@}). Continuation of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse, inculcating that protection is the very
<div n="lb">essence of kingly duties, quoting {%Bṛhaspati,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and
<div n="lb">verses sung by {%Bṛhaspati%} (“by exertion the {%amṛta%} was
<div n="lb">obtained, by exertion the {%Asuras%} were slain,” etc.). {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), expressed their delight with the discourse. Ṛ. and
<div n="lb">the princes left {%Bhīṣma%} for the night and ascended their
<div n="lb">chariots; then they bathed in the {%Dṛṣadvatī,%} offered oblations
<div n="lb">of water to their ancestors, etc., and entered {%Hāstinapura%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@58@}).—§ 641: The next morning the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Yādavas%} set out to {%Kurukṣetra,%} approached {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">and saluted the Ṛ.; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired about the origin
<div n="lb">of the word {%rājan%} (“king”). {%Bhīṣma's%} answer: In the
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta%} age sovereignty first began; the population of the earth
<div n="lb">became sinful; the {%Vedas,%} etc., were lost; D. applied to
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} who composed a treatise of 100,000 lessons, on
<div n="lb">virtue, profit, and pleasure, and emancipation, etc. (description).
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} addressing the gods, said that his work, aided by
<div n="lb">Chastisement {%(Daṇḍanīti),%} would protect the world. {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">studied the great work and abridged it (then called
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśālākṣa,%} in 10,000 lessons) for {%Indra,%} who abridged it
<div n="lb">further to 5,000 lessons, and called it {%Bāhudantaka; Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">further abridged it to 3,000 lessons, and called it {%Bārhaspatya;%}
<div n="lb">{%Kāvya%} [i.e. {%Uśanas%}] (the preceptor of {%yoga%}) further abridged
<div n="lb">it to 1,000 lessons. Thus, in view of the period of men's
<div n="lb">lives and [the general] decrease, that science {%(śāstra)%} was
<div n="lb">abridged by M.-ṛ. Asked by the gods, who deserved to have
<div n="lb">superiority among men, {%Viṣṇu%} created by his will a son,
<div n="lb">{%Virajas;%} but he inclined to renunciation; and so did {%Virajas'%}
<div n="lb">son {%Kīrtimat%} and the latter's son {%Kardama. Kardama's%}
<div n="lb">son {%Anaṅga%} became a protector of creatures, fully conversant
<div n="lb">with the science of chastisement.

<div n="lb">{%(Paitāmahe śāstre)%} (XII, {@59@}). Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the general duties of the four orders
[Page578-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">and the special duties of each of the orders. Sacrifice has
<div n="lb">been laid down for the {%śūdra%} also, but without {%svāhā%} and
<div n="lb">{%vaṣaṭkāra%} or any other {%mantra;%} he should perform {%pāka-%}
<div n="lb">{%yajñas,%} where the {%dakṣiṇā%} is {%pūrṇapātra%} (v. the note of
<div n="lb">PCR., p. 195); in days of old a {%śūdra%} of the name of
<div n="lb">{%Paijavana%} gave a {%dakṣiṇā%} of 100,000 {%pūrṇapātras%} according
<div n="lb">to the ordinance called {%Aindrāgnya%} (B. {%Aindrāgna%}). Devotion
<div n="lb">cleanses all sacrifices. The members of the three other
<div n="lb">classes have all sprung from the {%brahmans;%} the {%brahmans%} are
<div n="lb">the gods of the very gods. The {%śūdra,%} who is without
<div n="lb">{%Ṛe, Yajus,%} and {%Sāman,%} has {%Prajāpati%} for his god, and devotion
<div n="lb">for his sacrifice. A verse sung in praise of sacrifice by the
<div n="lb">{%Vaikhānasa munis.%} The {%homas%} called {%skanna%} and {%askanna%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@60@}). The four modes of life specified (<lang n="greek"></lang>). M.-r. cite
<div n="lb">a verse sung by {%Nārāyaṇa%} (XII, {@61@}). The four stages of
<div n="lb">life have been laid down for the {%brahman;%} the other three
<div n="lb">orders do not adopt them. What duties are improper for
<div n="lb">a {%brahman%} (XII, {@62@}). Continuation. The duties in the
<div n="lb">four stages of life stated more specifically. A {%kṣatriya,%} for
<div n="lb">leading the life of Ṛ., may adopt the {%bhikṣu%} mode of life;
<div n="lb">[but] a life of mendicancy is not obligatory upon the three
<div n="lb">orders (XII, {@63@}). The nature of kingly duties. “It has
<div n="lb">been told to you how, in days of old, many kings repaired to
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu (Nārāyaṇa)%} for the sake of the science of chastise-
<div n="lb">ment. S., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) are all observant of {%kṣatriya%} duties. In
<div n="lb">days of old when Dā. had multiplied, {%Māndhātṛ%} became king
<div n="lb">and performed a great sacrifice from desire of beholding
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu),%} who, in the form of {%Indra,%} had a discourse
<div n="lb">with him touching {%Viṣṇu,%} extolling the {%kṣatriya%} duties above
<div n="lb">all other duties, and citing the example of {%Viṣṇu%} himself,
<div n="lb">who for the sake of D. and Ṛ. and {%Brahmán%} and the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">slew all his foes among the As. (XII, {@64@}). {%Indra%} extolled the
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriya%} duties. Asked by {%Māndhātṛ,%} he set forth the
<div n="lb">duties of the {%Yavanas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Then {%Nārāyaṇa%} (in the
<div n="lb">form of {%Indra%}), accompanied by M., repaired to his eternal
<div n="lb">abode (XII, {@65@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} dis-
<div n="lb">coursed in detail on the four stages of life (XII, {@66@}). What
<div n="lb">should be the characteristics of kingdoms. In days of old,
<div n="lb">in consequence of anarchy, men met with destruction; they
<div n="lb">made certain compacts, but soon repaired to {%Brahmán%} to get
<div n="lb">a king; {%Manu%} was prevailed upon to accept the kingdom,
<div n="lb">against getting one-fiftieth of their animals, one-tenth
<div n="lb">of their grain, one-quarter of their merit, etc. {%Manu%} then
<div n="lb">made his round through the world, checking everywhere all
<div n="lb">acts of wickedness. Men desiring happiness must choose
<div n="lb">a king (XII, {@67@}). Why the king is regarded as a god on
<div n="lb">earth. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the discourse between {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">(the son of {%Aṅgiras%}) and {%Vasumanas%} (king of {%Kośala%});
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} described the evils of anarchy; the king becomes
<div n="lb">{%Agni,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vasumanas%} thenceforth began to protect his
<div n="lb">subjects (XII, {@68@}). The special duties of a king; the
<div n="lb">duties of a king in case of an invasion by a stronger monarch,
<div n="lb">quoting {%Bṛhaspati%} (v. 2619) and two verses (v. 2667—8) sung
<div n="lb">by {%Aṅgiras%} (i.e. {%Bṛhaspati%}). The blessedness of chastisement;
<div n="lb">the king causes the {%Kṛta%} age, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), to set in (XII, {@69@}).
<div n="lb">The thirty six virtues that a king should possess. Hearing
<div n="lb">the words of {%Bhīṣma,%} king {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} protected by {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">etc., worshipped {%Bhīṣma,%} and from that time began to rule
<div n="lb">according to his teaching (XII, {@70@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhiṣma%} explained the way in which the king should
<div n="lb">discharge the duty of protection (XII, {@71@}). The quali-
<div n="lb">fications of the king's priest: {%Bhīṣma%} recited the old story
<div n="lb">about the discourse between {%Aila's%} son {%Purūravas%} and
[Page578-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Mātariśvan,%} explaining the order of birth of the four
<div n="lb">classes (from {%Brahmán's%} mouth, arms, thighs, and feet,
<div n="lb">respectively) and their duties, the right of dominion apper-
<div n="lb">taining to the {%brahman;%} therefore a king should appoint
<div n="lb">a priest; D., men, P., G., Us., and Rā. all depend upon
<div n="lb">sacrifices for their support, and sacrifices depend upon the
<div n="lb">king, who is {%Indra, Yama,%} and {%Dharma%} (XII, {@72@}). The
<div n="lb">effects of a disunion between {%brahmans%} and {%kṣatriyas:%}
<div n="lb">the old story about the discourse of {%Aila's%} son and {%Kaśyapa;%}
<div n="lb">the {%brahman%} and the {%kṣatriya%} are said to be the progenitors
<div n="lb">of all men; in consequence of the sins perpetrated by sinful
<div n="lb">men, the god {%Rudra%} appears in the kingdom. Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Aila, Kaśyapa%} explained who {%Rudra%} is and what his acts
<div n="lb">are ({%Rudra%} exists in the hearts of men; his shape is like that
<div n="lb">of the wind-gods). Then follows a discussion of the following
<div n="lb">question: “If chastisement touches the wicked and the good
<div n="lb">equally, why should the good yet abstain from acts of
<div n="lb">wickedness” (XII, {@73@}). The preservation and growth of
<div n="lb">the king rest upon the king's priest: {%Mucukundopākhyāna (<lang n="greek"></lang>),%}
<div n="lb">the old narrative about the discourse between king {%Mucukunda%}
<div n="lb">and king {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (the lord of {%Alakā,%} Kubera) (XII, {@74@}).
<div n="lb">The conduct by which a king aggrandises his subjects
<div n="lb">and wins regions of felicity hereafter. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} did not
<div n="lb">see any merit in sovereignty and wished to retire into the
<div n="lb">woods. {%Bhīṣma%} urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to put forth manliness
<div n="lb">and exertion (XII, {@75@}). The difference between {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">engaged in their own duties and those amongst them that
<div n="lb">are not so engaged (XII, {@76@}). The king is the lord of all
<div n="lb">wealth except what belongs to the {%brahmans.%} The old
<div n="lb">narrative of the speech made by the {%Kaikeya%} king unto a Rā.,
<div n="lb">who was about to abduct him, but at last left him (XII, {@77@}).
<div n="lb">Whether a {%brahman,%} in seasons of distress, can practise, as a
<div n="lb">means of livelihood, the duties of a {%vaiśya;%} what articles, in
<div n="lb">this case, he may sell; how the king should behave when he is
<div n="lb">opposed by all the orders of men; if {%kṣatriyas%} become hostile
<div n="lb">to {%brahmans,%} how the latter should be protected; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">inquired whether, upon an anarchy happening, any man that
<div n="lb">protects and rules acquires merit; {%Bhīṣma%} answered in the
<div n="lb">affirmative; a king that does not or cannot protect is useless
<div n="lb">(XII, {@78@}). The king of persons that are eligible as royal
<div n="lb">priests; the limits or measure of the {%dakṣiṇā%} (XII, {@79@}).
<div n="lb">Who should and who should not be trusted by the king
<div n="lb">(XII, {@80@}). How the king should conduct himself for
<div n="lb">winning over kinsmen and friends: the old story of
<div n="lb">a discourse between {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Nārada: Kṛṣṇa%} said: “My
<div n="lb">heart is worried through the cruel speeches of my kinsmen;
<div n="lb">might resides in {%Saṅkarṣaṇa,%} mildness in {%Gada;%} and as
<div n="lb">regards {%Pradyumna,%} he surpasses even myself in beauty of
<div n="lb">person; [but] many others of the {%Andhakas%} and the {%Vṛṣṇis%}
<div n="lb">are possessed of great prosperity and might. What can be
<div n="lb">more painful than [my relation to] {%Ahuka%} and {%Akrūra%}
<div n="lb">(v. the note of PCR., p. 260)?” {%Nārada%} said that the calamity
<div n="lb">was due to Kṛṣṇa himself; “the kingdom cannot be taken
<div n="lb">back from {%Babhru%} and {%Ugrasena,%} employ soft words, etc.;
<div n="lb">the {%Yādavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) are dependent on thee; Ṛ. always pray
<div n="lb">for thy advancement; thou art the lord of all creatures, etc.”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@81@}). The second means by which a king may win
<div n="lb">kinsmen and friends; an old story is cited of what the sage
<div n="lb">{%(brahmarṣi) Kālakavṛkṣīya%} had said to the {%Kośala%} king
<div n="lb">{%Kṣemadarśin; Kālakavṛkṣīya%} travelled through the country
<div n="lb">with a crow in a cage and observed the misdeeds of all the
<div n="lb">officers of the king, saying that it was the crow that told
<div n="lb">him all this, and related it to the king; the crow then was
[Page579-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">found pierced with a shaft within the cage; he quoted {%Yama%}
<div n="lb">as to the painful lot of those that serve the king; “this thy
<div n="lb">kingdom is like the river {%Sītā,%} boats sink in it; thy father
<div n="lb">regarded me lovingly as his friend; when distress overtook
<div n="lb">this kingdom during the reign of thy father I performed
<div n="lb">many penances.” {%Kṣemadarśin%} then took a minister from
<div n="lb">the {%kṣatriya%} order, and appointed {%Kālakavṛkṣīya%} as his
<div n="lb">{%purohita,%} and subjugated the whole earth (XII, {@82@}). The
<div n="lb">qualifications of legislators, ministers, courtiers, and counsellors
<div n="lb">(XII, {@83@}). The merits of agreeableness of speech; the old
<div n="lb">account of a conversation between {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Śakra%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Indra) (XII, {@84@}). Which are the affairs of state that
<div n="lb">a king has to deal with, and by which persons ought they
<div n="lb">to be executed? (XII, {@85@}). The kind of city which a king
<div n="lb">should have (XII, {@86@}). How a kingdom should be con-
<div n="lb">solidated and how it should be protected (XII, {@87@}). How
<div n="lb">a king should behave if he wishes for wealth (XII, {@88@}).
<div n="lb">A king should not cut down trees yielding edible fruits.
<div n="lb">How one man acquires superiority over the rest; the gifts
<div n="lb">made by thee in this world support D., P., men, N., Rā.,
<div n="lb">birds, and animals (XII, {@89@}). The duties of kings
<div n="lb">{%(kṣatradharmān)%} explained by {%Aṅgiras Utathya%} to {%Māndhātṛ%}
<div n="lb">{%Yauvanāśva,%} about the king's power being only a trust for
<div n="lb">the good of his people and not for the gratification of his
<div n="lb">own caprices; the Ṛ. made the king, intending that he
<div n="lb">should be the embodiment of righteousness on earth; he is
<div n="lb">called {%rājan%} (“king”) in whom righteousness shines {%(rājeta);%}
<div n="lb">he in whom there is no righteousness is called a {%vṛṣala%}
<div n="lb">{%(yasminvilīyate dharmaḥ (= vṛṣaḥ)); dharma%} (“righteousness”)
<div n="lb">comes {%(sravati)%} from {%dhana%} (“wealth”) or from {%dhāraṇa%}
<div n="lb">(“restraining”); {%Svayambhū%} (Brahmán) created {%Dharma%} for
<div n="lb">the advancement and growth of creatures; in consequence
<div n="lb">of his malice towards the brahmans {%Śrī%} deserted {%Bali%}
<div n="lb">{%Vairocana%} and repaired to {%Indra,%} and {%Bali%} indulged in many
<div n="lb">vain regrets. The {%śrutis%} declare that Unrighteousness
<div n="lb">{%(Adharma)%} begat a son named Pride {%(Darpa)%} upon {%Śrī;%} Pride
<div n="lb">led many D. and As. to ruin, and many R.-r.; when the king
<div n="lb">does not restrain vice, sinful Rā., and persons of neutral sex,
<div n="lb">etc., begin to take birth even in respectable families, etc.
<div n="lb">(XII, {@90@}). Continuation of {%Utathya's%} discourse. “The ages
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), are all dependent on the conduct of the
<div n="lb">king. It is said that the Creator {%(Dhātṛ)%} created power for
<div n="lb">the object of protecting the weak; weakness is indeed
<div n="lb">a great being, for everything depends upon it. The king
<div n="lb">is {%Yama%} himself. This is the way in which {%Indra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">have acted. D., R., P., and G. sing the praises, both here
<div n="lb">and hereafter, of that king whose conduct is righteous.”
<div n="lb">Thus addressed by {%Utathya, Māndhātṛ%} did as he was directed,
<div n="lb">and became the sole lord of the wide earth (XII, {@91@}). How
<div n="lb">a righteous king desirous of acting righteously should behave:
<div n="lb">the old story of what M.-ṛ. {%Vāmadeva%} sang in ancient times to
<div n="lb">king {%Vasumanas%} (XII, {@92@}); the consequences that result
<div n="lb">from the king's acting unrighteously. “{%Yayāti Nāhuṣa,%}
<div n="lb">thus having propounded the king's lore {%(rājopaniṣadaṃ),%}
<div n="lb">said that a king should slay even contemptible foes”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@93@}). Continuation of {%Vāmadeva's%} discourse. Thus
<div n="lb">addressed by {%Vāmadeva,%} king {%Vasumanas%} did as he was
<div n="lb">directed (XII, {@94@}). How a {%kṣatriya%} should act who desires
<div n="lb">to subjugate another (XII, {@95@}). A king should never desire
<div n="lb">to subjugate the earth by unrighteous means. It was by
<div n="lb">such behaviour that {%Indra%} got the sovereignty of the world.
<div n="lb">King {%Pratardana,%} subjugating his foes in great battle, took
<div n="lb">all their wealth, including their very grain and medicinal
[Page579-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">herbs, but left their land untouched. King {%Divodāsa,%} after
<div n="lb">subjugating his foes, brought away the very remnants of
<div n="lb">their sacrificial fires, their clarified butter, and their food;
<div n="lb">for this reason he was deprived of the merit of his conquest.
<div n="lb">King {%Nābhāga%} gave away whole kingdoms with their rulers
<div n="lb">as sacrificial presents to the {%brahmans,%} excepting the wealth
<div n="lb">of learned {%brahmans%} and ascetics (XII, {@96@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">condemnation of {%kṣatriya%} practices. {%Bhīṣma%} pointed out
<div n="lb">that by chastening the wicked, protecting the good, performing
<div n="lb">sacrifices, etc., a king cleanses himself, and ultimately
<div n="lb">obtains a residence in {%Indra's%} heaven (XII, {@97@}). The
<div n="lb">regions of felicity acquired by heroes killed in battle: the old
<div n="lb">story of the discourse between {%Ambarīṣa%} and {%Indra.%}
<div n="lb">{%Ambarīṣa,%} the son of {%Nābhāga,%} having repaired to heaven,
<div n="lb">beheld his own generalissimo {%Sudeva%} in the company of
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} and going to regions still higher. {%Indra%} explained to
<div n="lb">{%Ambarīṣa%} the sacrifice of battle. “That warrior who,
<div n="lb">having slain the commander of the hostile army, mounts
<div n="lb">the vehicle of his fallen antagonist, comes to be regarded as
<div n="lb">possessed of the powers of {%Viṣṇu%} and the intelligence of
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%}…thousands of Aps. covet him for their lord;
<div n="lb">having slain {%Jambha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), I myself have become the
<div n="lb">chief of the celestials” (XII, {@98@}). The old story of the
<div n="lb">battle between {%Pratardana%} and king {%Janaka,%} who cheered
<div n="lb">his troops by showing them both heaven (full of G.-girls,
<div n="lb">etc.) and hell; his warriors vanquished their foes in battle
<div n="lb">(XII, {@99@}). How kings should lead their troops to battle.

<div n="lb">of the future success of an army. “{%Śambara%} has said that
<div n="lb">having afflicted a foe first, forgiveness should be shown
<div n="lb">afterwards” (XII, {@102@}). How a king should behave
<div n="lb">towards a foe that is mild, towards one that is fierce, and
<div n="lb">towards one that has many allies: the old narrative of the
<div n="lb">discourse between {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Indra; Bṛhaspati%} recom-

<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} in subduing his foes, acted strictly according to the

<div n="lb">should act; the discourse between {%Kṣemadarśin%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kālakavṛkṣīya%} in days of old, when prince {%(nṛpasutaḥ) Kṣema-%}
<div n="lb">{%darśin%} had become weak and fallen into great distress; “only

<div n="lb">How may good and wicked men be recognized? the old story
<div n="lb">of the discourse between a tiger and a jackal: in ancient
<div n="lb">times, in a rich city called {%Purikā,%} there was a cruel king
<div n="lb">{%Paurika,%} who was reborn as a jackal; remembering his
<div n="lb">former prosperity he became filled with grief and abstained
<div n="lb">from meat, and became compassionate and truthful, etc.,
<div n="lb">and lived upon fruit that had dropped from the trees; he
<div n="lb">dwelt in a vast crematorium, his birth-place. The other
<div n="lb">jackals in vain endeavoured to make him eat carrion,
<div n="lb">promising to give him food. He consented to become the
<div n="lb">minister of a tiger, on the condition that the latter should
<div n="lb">always meet with him alone and in secret, etc. The old
<div n="lb">servants of the king (i.e. the tiger) first in vain tried to bribe
<div n="lb">him; then they secretly placed the meat intended for the
<div n="lb">king in the house of the jackal. The king ordered the jackal
<div n="lb">to be slain. The mother of the king dissuaded him (“the
<div n="lb">firmament seems to be like the solid base of a vessel, the
<div n="lb">fire-fly seems to be like the actual spark of fire; in reality,
<div n="lb">however, the sky has no base, and there is no fire in the
<div n="lb">fire-fly; there is necessity for secreting”). A righteous
<div n="lb">agent of the jackal discovered everything about the false
<div n="lb">accusation. Notwithstanding the entreaties of the king, the
<div n="lb">jackal retired to the forest, gave up his body by sitting in
<div n="lb">{%prāya,%} and proceeded to heaven (XII, {@111@}). A king should
<div n="lb">not behave after the manner disclosed in the history of
<div n="lb">a camel: There was, in the {%Kṛta%} age, a huge camel who
<div n="lb">had recollection of all the acts of his former life; he practised
<div n="lb">severe austerities in the forest; {%Brahmán%} granted him the
<div n="lb">boon that he should have a neck so long that he could seize
<div n="lb">any food at even the end of 100 {%yojanas.%} He became idle.
<div n="lb">One day a great storm arose. The camel placed his head
<div n="lb">and a portion of his neck within the cave of a mountain; it
<div n="lb">began to pour in torrents; a jackal with his wife entered
<div n="lb">the cave for shelter and began to eat of the camel's neck, and
<div n="lb">thus the camel met with his death because of his idleness.
<div n="lb">“{%Manu%} has said that victory depends upon intelligence”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@112@}). The old story of the discourse between the
<div n="lb">Ocean and the Rivers. The Ocean (the refuge of the foes of

<div n="lb">bends (XII, {@113@}). How a man of worth should behave
<div n="lb">when insulted with harsh words in an assembly (XII, {@114@}).
<div n="lb">The qualifications of persons that may be employed by the

<div n="lb">king. “Criminal laws should be duly administered, even
<div n="lb">after the manner of {%Śaṅkha%} and {%Likhita%}” (XII, {@115@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the story of the dog who by favour of the
<div n="lb">Ṛ. became a {%śarabha%} and was, for misconduct, retransformed
<div n="lb">into his own canine form; {%Bhīṣma%} had heard the tale in
<div n="lb">the hermitage of {%Rāma Jāmadagnya,%} recited by many Ṛ.; the
<div n="lb">dog first was transformed into a leopard, then into a tiger
<div n="lb">subsisting upon the other animals of the forest (XII, {@116@});
<div n="lb">then into an elephant > a lion > a {%śarabha%} (having eight legs
<div n="lb">and eyes on the forehead); one day, eagerly thirsting for
<div n="lb">blood, he wished to slay the sage, who then retransformed
<div n="lb">him into a dog (XII, {@117@}); the dog became very cheerless,
<div n="lb">and was driven by Ṛ. from his hermitage. Continuation of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on the qualifications of servants (XII,
<div n="lb">{@118@}). The lessons to be drawn from the story of the dog
<div n="lb">that was transformed into a {%śarabha%} (XII, {@119@}). How a
<div n="lb">king should exercise the duty of protection; “the human body
<div n="lb">is the residence of {%Indra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)” (XII, {@120@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed about the origin and
<div n="lb">character of chastisement (“the foremost of all beings among
<div n="lb">D., Ṛ., P., Y., Rā., Pś., Sā., As., etc.”), quoting {%Manu%} and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} (“the first word”: {%prāgvacanaṃ%}); some of the
<div n="lb">names of chastisement (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “beggars, principal judges,
<div n="lb">astrologers, performers of propitiatory and {%Atharvan%} rites,
<div n="lb">treasury, allies, grain, etc., constitute the body, composed of
<div n="lb">seven attributes and eight limbs, of a kingdom; chastisement
<div n="lb">is another powerful limb of a kingdom”; it springs from
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} (the creator of the universe with D., As., Rā., etc.)
<div n="lb">and the {%Veda;%} several kinds of {%vyavahāra; Brahmán%} has laid
<div n="lb">down: “neither mother nor father, nor brother, nor wife,
<div n="lb">nor priest, is unpunishable with that king who rules agreeably
<div n="lb">to his duty” (XII, {@121@}). The discourse between the {%Aṅga%}
<div n="lb">king {%Vasuhoma%} (who was pious and, with his spouse, always
<div n="lb">practised penances) and {%Indra's%} friend king {%Māndhātṛ,%} at
<div n="lb">{%Muñjapṛṣṭha%} (esteemed by P. and D.-ṛ.) on that peak of

<div n="lb">{%ādiśat;%} Nīl. is silent) a favourite haunt of {%Rudra,%} where
<div n="lb">{%Vasuhoma%} came to be regarded as a D.-r. Asked by {%Māndhātṛ%}
<div n="lb">about the origin of chastisement, {%Vasuhoma%} (who knew the
<div n="lb">doctrines of {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Uśanas%}) related: Once {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">desiring to perform a sacrifice, failed to find a priest; he
<div n="lb">conceived in his brain; after 1,000 years he sneezed; the
<div n="lb">fœtus, {%Kṣupa,%} fell from his head; he became a lord of
<div n="lb">creatures and a priest in the sacrifice of {%Brahmán.%} Chastise-
<div n="lb">ment disappeared; a great confusion set in; {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">repaired to {%Viṣṇu%} (armed with an enormous {%śūla%}), who
<div n="lb">created his own self into the form of chastisement (having
<div n="lb">righteousness for its legs); from that form the goddess
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī%} created the Science of Chastisement {%(daṇḍanīti);%}
<div n="lb">after this {%Viṣṇu (śūlavarāyudhaḥ)%} made {%Indra%} the ruler of

<div n="lb">times between Ṛ. {%Kāmanda[ka]%} and king {%Āṅgariṣṭha%} (XII,
<div n="lb">{@123@}). How may one acquire a virtuous behaviour? {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">recited the discourse of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to {%Duryodhana;%} as the
<div n="lb">latter was burning with envy at the sight of the prosperity
<div n="lb">of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brothers at {%Indraprastha%} and his
<div n="lb">mistakes in the palace he, accompanied by {%Karṇa,%} went to
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with the same question; “10,000 {%snātakas%} eat
<div n="lb">at {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} palace off plates of gold; his steeds are of
<div n="lb">the {%Tittiri%} and the {%Kalmāṣa%} breeds (? so PCR.; {%aśvāṃs%}
<div n="lb">{%tittiri-kalmāṣān%}), etc.” {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said: “{%Māndhātṛ%}
<div n="lb">conquered the whole world in only one night, {%Janamejaya%} in the
<div n="lb">course of three, {%Nābhāga%} in seven,” and he related the story of
<div n="lb">{%Indra's%} taking away from Dai. {%Prahlāda%} the latter's prosperity;
<div n="lb">{%Prahlāda%} in days of yore, by the merit of his behaviour,
<div n="lb">snatched from {%Indra%} his sovereignty and reduced the three
<div n="lb">worlds to subjection. {%Indra%} repaired for knowledge to
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati,%} who caused him to repair to {%Bhārgava%} (Uśanas),
<div n="lb">who said that {%Prahlāda%} had better knowledge. {%Indra,%} in the
<div n="lb">shape of a {%brahman,%} repaired to {%Prahlāda,%} who said that he
<div n="lb">was ever obedient to the teachings of {%Śukra,%} etc. {%Prahlāda%}
<div n="lb">granted him a boon, and {%Indra%} wished him to acquire
<div n="lb">{%Prahlāda's%} nature {%(śīla). Prahlāda%} was filled with fear, but
<div n="lb">granted the boon. A flame of light issued out of his body:
<div n="lb">it was the embodiment of his nature, which was going away
<div n="lb">and entered the body of {%Indra.%} Then a similar apparition
<div n="lb">issued out: it was Righteousness; then Truth; then Good
<div n="lb">Deeds; then Might; then Prosperity, that informed him that
<div n="lb">the brahman was {%Śakra.%} Asked by {%Duryodhana, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">told him how moral conduct {%(śīla)%} might be acquired (XII, {@124@}).
<div n="lb">The characteristics of Hope; “{%Duryodhana%} destroyed the hope
<div n="lb">I had cherished,” said {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} The discourse between
<div n="lb">R.-ṛ. {%Sumitra%} (of the {%Haihaya%} race) and {%Ṛṣabha. Sumitra,%}
<div n="lb">when hunting, was led away by a deer that he had pierced
<div n="lb">with an arrow; he shot at it again, but in vain (XII, {@125@});
<div n="lb">arrived at an asylum he asked Ṛ. about Hope (XII, {@126@});
<div n="lb">{%Ṛṣabha%} told him that he had visited {%Badarī,%} the asylum of
<div n="lb">{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa,%} where the sage {%Aśvaśiras%} reads the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas;%} “having performed my ablutions in the lake and
<div n="lb">offered oblations of water to P. and D., I entered the
<div n="lb">asylum; not far from that spot I entered another retreat,
<div n="lb">where I beheld a very tall and emaciated Ṛ., {%Tanu,%} exceedingly
<div n="lb">feeble; he began to discourse in the midst of Ṛ.; a king came
<div n="lb">with his forces and ladies on a chariot drawn by fleet steeds;
<div n="lb">the name of this king was {%Vīradyumna;%} his son and only
<div n="lb">child {%Bhūridyumna%} had been missing, and {%Vīradyumna%} came
<div n="lb">there in course of his wanderings amidst the forest in pursuit

<div n="lb">discoursed about the slenderness of Hope. Then he caused
[Page581-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">the lost prince to be brought thither, rebuked the king,
<div n="lb">and displayed himself to be the god of righteousness.” Thus
<div n="lb">addressed by {%Ṛṣabha,%} king {%Sumitra%} gave up his hope (XII,

<div n="lb">between {%Gautama%} and {%Yama. Gautama%} owned a wide retreat
<div n="lb">on the {%Pāripātra%} hills; for 60,000 years he underwent ascetic
<div n="lb">austerities there. One day Lp. {%Yama (Dharma)%} came and
