{@Vāsiṣṭha(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating to Vasiṣṭha”).
<div n="lb">§ 11 (Parvas.): I, {@2,@} 387 {%(°am ākhyanaṃ).%}—§ 223 (Caitrar.).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} wished to hear about {%Vasiṣṭha.%} The {%Gandharva%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha%} is {%Brahmán's%} spiritual son and {%Arundhatī's%} husband;
<div n="lb">{%Kāma%} and {%Krodha,%} who cannot be vanquished even by the
<div n="lb">immortals, used to shampoo his feet. Though his wrath was
<div n="lb">excited by {%Viśvāmitra's%} offence, he did not yet exterminate
<div n="lb">the {%Kuśikas.%} Afflicted at the loss of his sons, he did not do
<div n="lb">any dreadful deed for the destruction of {%Viśvāmitra.%} He did
<div n="lb">not transgress {%Kṛtānta%} (Death) in order to bring back his lost
<div n="lb">children from the abode of {%Yama.%} It was by obtaining him
<div n="lb">that the {%Ikṣvākus%} acquired this earth, and with him as their
<div n="lb">{%purohita,%} they performed many great sacrifices. “Therefore
<div n="lb">acquire a fit {%purohita%}” (I, {@174@}). {%Arjuna%} wished to hear
<div n="lb">of the hostility between {%Viśvāmitra%} and {%Vasiṣṭha.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Gandharva%} said: This old {%(purāṇa)%} story of {%Vasiṣṭha%} they
<div n="lb">tell in all worlds. In {%Kānyakubja%} king {%Gādhi,%} son of {%Kuśika,%}
<div n="lb">had a son {%Viśvāmitra,%} who, with his ministers, used to go a
<div n="lb">hunting. Once he arrived at the hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha,%}
<div n="lb">who offered him {%arghya,%} etc. from his cow {%Nandinī,%} who
<div n="lb">yielded everything desired; {%Viśvāmitra%} asked {%Vasiṣṭha%} to
<div n="lb">give him {%Nandinī%} for an {%arbuda%} of kine or his kingdom, but in
<div n="lb">vain. Then he wanted to take the cow by force. She repaired
<div n="lb">to {%Vasiṣṭha,%} who at first did nothing, saying, “I am a
<div n="lb">forgiving {%brahman%}”; but at last he said: “I do not abandon
<div n="lb">you! Stay if you can!” Hearing this word, the cow attacked
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra's%} troops; from her tail she began to rain showers
<div n="lb">of burning coals; from her tail she brought forth {%Pahlavas,%}
<div n="lb">from her udders {%Drāviḍas%} and {%Śakas,%} from her womb
<div n="lb">{%(yonideśāt) Yavanas,%} from her dung {%(śakṛt) Śabaras,%} from her
<div n="lb">urine {%Kāñcis,%} and from her sides {%Śarabhas%} (B. {%Śabarān%} and
<div n="lb">{%kāṃścid%} instead of {%Kāñcīn%}), and from the froth of her mouth
<div n="lb">{%Pauṇḍras, Kirātas, Yavanas, Siṃhalas, Barbaras, Vaśas%} (B.
<div n="lb">{%Khaśān%}), {%Civukas, Pulindas, Cīnas, Hūṇas, Keralas,%} and other
<div n="lb">{%Mlecchas,%} who attacked {%Viśvāmitra's%} soldiers. {%Viśvāmitra's%}
<div n="lb">troops fied, but none was deprived of life. {%Viśvāmitra%} then,
<div n="lb">disgusted with {%kṣatriya%} prowess (“{%brahman%} prowess is true
<div n="lb">prowess”), set his mind on asceticism, and finally became a
[Page716-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%brahman%} and drank {%soma%} with {%Indra%} (I, {@175@}).—§ 224:
<div n="lb">{%Kalmāṣapāda%} (q.v.)—§ 225. {%Vasiṣṭha%} patiently bore his
<div n="lb">grief, and resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than
<div n="lb">exterminate the {%Kauśikas.%} He threw himself down from the
<div n="lb">summit of {%Meru,%} entered a huge fire in the forest, and tied a
<div n="lb">strong weight to his neck and threw himself into the sea,
<div n="lb">but all in vain, and, in distress of heart, he returned to his
<div n="lb">hermitage (I, {@176@}). Beholding it bereft of his children, he
<div n="lb">left it again and tied himself strongly with cords and flung
<div n="lb">himself into a mighty river, but the stream cut those cords
<div n="lb">and cast the {%ṛṣi%} ashore, whence that river was called {%Vipāśā.%}
<div n="lb">Once more he threw himself into a river flowing from
<div n="lb">{%Himavat (Haimavatī),%} but the river immediately fled in 100
<div n="lb">different directions, and has since been known by the name
<div n="lb">of the {%Śatadru%} ({%“śatadhā vidrutā”,%} v. 6753). He now again
<div n="lb">went towards his hermitage, and was on the way addressed
<div n="lb">by {%Adṛśyantī,%} the wife of {%Śaktri,%} who had for twelve years
<div n="lb">borne his child in her womb. Hearing that child in the
<div n="lb">womb reciting the {%Vedas%} with the six {%Aṅgas, Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">refrained from self-destruction, and, accompanied by
<div n="lb">{%Adṛśyantī,%} returned to his hermitage. One day he saw
<div n="lb">{%Kalmāṣapāda,%} who would devour him; {%Adṛśyantī%} was
<div n="lb">terrified, but {%Vasiṣṭha%} restrained him by uttering {%“huṃ”,%}
<div n="lb">and, sprinkling him with water sanctified by {%mantras,%} and
<div n="lb">freed him from his curse that had lasted twelve years.
<div n="lb">{%Kalmāṣapāda%} promised never more to insult {%brahmans,%} and
<div n="lb">prevailed upon {%Vasiṣṭha%} that he accompanied him to his
<div n="lb">capital {%Ayodhyā%} and begat a son for him on the queen.
<div n="lb">Then he went back to his hermitage. After twelve years
<div n="lb">the queen tore open her womb by a stone, and then was born
<div n="lb">the {%rājarṣi Aśmaka,%} who founded the city of {%Paudanya%}
<div n="lb">(I, {@177@}).—§ 226: {%Parāśara%} (q.v.).
