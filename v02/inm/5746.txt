{@[Kīcakavadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the slaughter of the Kīcakas”),
<div n="lb">the 54th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr. § 551: The
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas thus passed ten months in Matsya's city. As the
<div n="lb">year was about to expire, Kīcaka, the senāpati and brother-
<div n="lb">in-law of Virāṭa, became enamoured of Kṛṣṇā, who rebuked
<div n="lb">him and warned him of the Gandharvas, her husbands (IV, {@14@}).
<div n="lb">Then he caused Sudeṣṇā {%(Kaikeyī)%} to send Kṛṣṇā to him
<div n="lb">to fetch wine. Kṛṣṇā adored the Sun, who commanded a
<div n="lb">Rākṣasa to protect her invisibly (IV, {@15@}). As Kīcaka
<div n="lb">seized her, she dashed him to the ground and rushed to
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira, followed by Kīcaka, who brought her down
<div n="lb">and seized her by the hair, but the Rākṣasa gave him
<div n="lb">a puṣ, so that he fell down senseless. Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">apprehensive of discovery, commanded Bhīmasena to forbear.
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇā rebuked Virāṭa and was praised by the courtiers, but
<div n="lb">sent back to Sudeṣṇā by Yudhiṣṭhira: “the Gandharvas
<div n="lb">will surely dispel thy woe.” Sudeṣṇā said: “I shall cause
<div n="lb">Kīcaka to be slain, if thou wishest it.” Kṛṣṇā answered:
<div n="lb">“Even others will slay him” (IV, {@16@}). Kṛṣṇā rose up at
<div n="lb">night and proceeded to Bhīmasena (IV, {@17@}), and complained
<div n="lb">of their plight and especially that of Sahadeva {%(b)%} (IV, {@18—21@}).
<div n="lb">Bhīmasena exhorted her to endure a little longer, reminding
<div n="lb">her of Sukanyā, Indrasenā {%(c),%} Sītā, Lopāmudrā, and Sāvitrī
<div n="lb">(IV, {@21@}), and said: “To-morrow evening you should manage
<div n="lb">to have a meeting with Kīcaka in the dancing hall, but so that
<div n="lb">others may not espy thee.” Kīcaka came to the rendezvous
<div n="lb">and was slain by Bhīmasena, and Kṛṣṇā said to the keepers
<div n="lb">of the dancing-hall: “Kīcaka has been slain by my Gandharva
<div n="lb">husbands” (IV, {@22@}). Kīcaka's relatives obtained permission
<div n="lb">from Virāṭa to cremate Kṛṣṇā with him, and carried her
<div n="lb">towards the burning-place. She cried “Jaya”, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">Bhīmasena hearing it, came and slew 105 of them with a tree
<div n="lb">(IV, {@23@}). Virāṭa got afraid and caused Sudeṣṇā to ask
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇā to leave the country, but she obtained permission to
<div n="lb">remain for thirteen days (IV, {@24@}).
