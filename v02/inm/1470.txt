{@Bhīmakadalīkhaṇḍapraveśa(ḥ)@}¦ (Bhīma's entering the
<div n="lb">plantain thicket). § 424 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): There they dwelt
<div n="lb">for six nights. Suddenly a wind from the north-east brought
<div n="lb">a celestial lotus of 1,000 petals, which {%Kṛṣṇā%} presented to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira;%} she sent {%Bhīma%} to bring others, in order to
<div n="lb">carry them to their hermitage in {%Kāmyaka. Bhīma%} proceeded
<div n="lb">along the slopes of the {%Gandhamādana (b);%} the lions, etc.,
<div n="lb">fled; invisible, the wives of {%Yakṣas%} and {%Gandharvas%} stared
<div n="lb">at him. After having bathed in a lake, he blew his shell
<div n="lb">and began to proceed into a plaintain wood, but was arrested
<div n="lb">by his brother the ape {%Hanumat,%} who for his good obstructed
<div n="lb">the way to heaven {%(divaṅgamaṃ mārgaṃ),%} saying that this
<div n="lb">was the path to the {%devaloka,%} impassable by mortals, save
<div n="lb">the way of {%siddhi (siddhigatiṃ)%} (III, {@146@}). {%Hanumat%} said
<div n="lb">he was suffering from illness and could not rise; but {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">would not leap over him, and could not remove his tail.—
