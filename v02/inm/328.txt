{@Ajagaraparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the Boa”; the
<div n="lb">40th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 448: The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">spent four years with Arjuna in the gardens of Kubera,
<div n="lb">which added to the preceding six make ten years of exile.
<div n="lb">In the eleventh year Yudhiṣṭhira, advised by Bhīma,
<div n="lb">took leave of those regions, determining again to practise
<div n="lb">austerities on the mountain, when he had regained his
<div n="lb">kingdom; and after Lomaśa had returned to the abode
<div n="lb">of the gods, they with the brahmans proceeded along that
<div n="lb">very road, carried by Ghaṭotkaca and his followers, and
<div n="lb">advised also by Ārṣṭiṣeṇa (III, {@176@}).—§ 449: Having
<div n="lb">crossed Kailāsa, they passed one night in the hermitage
<div n="lb">of king Vṛṣaparvan {%(b),%} then one month at Badarī,
<div n="lb">seeing Kubera's {%(c)%} favourite lake {%(nalinīm),%} then crossing
<div n="lb">the land of Cīna, Tuṣāra, Darada, and all the regions
<div n="lb">of Kulinda, and the difficult Himālaya regions, they
<div n="lb">reached the city of the Kirāta king Subāhu, where they
<div n="lb">met with their charioteers Viśoka, etc., and their servants
<div n="lb">Mahendrasena, etc., the cooks and servants of the kitchen.
<div n="lb">After having stayed there one night, they, dismissing
<div n="lb">Ghaṭotkaca and his followers, with the charioteers and
<div n="lb">chariots reached “the king of mountains” near Yamunā
<div n="lb">({%Yāmunam adrirājam,%} i.e. {%Yamunodgamam,%} Nīl.; “name of
<div n="lb">a mountain,” BR.), where they dwelt for one year, occupied
[Page027-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">with hunting, in the forest Viśākhayūpa. There in a cavern
<div n="lb">Bhīma was seized by a snake and rescued by Yudhiṣṭhira.
<div n="lb">In the twelfth year of their exile they repaired thence to
<div n="lb">the borders of the desert, and desirous of dwelling by the
<div n="lb">Sarasvatī {%(d),%} they went there, and thence reached the
<div n="lb">lake of Dvaitavana (III, {@177@}).—§ 450: At the request
<div n="lb">of Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana detailed how Bhīma, when
<div n="lb">they had come from the rājarṣi Vṛṣaparvan's hermitage,
<div n="lb">was hunting with unpoisoned {%(śuddhair)%} arrows on some spots
<div n="lb">of Himavat {%(b),%} was seized by a huge snake, and on
<div n="lb">account of a boon that had been granted to the serpent
<div n="lb">was quite unable to extricate himself (III, {@178@}). The
<div n="lb">serpent said that he was the rājarṣi Nahuṣa, the son of
<div n="lb">Āyu, whom Agastya had cursed to become a serpent, out of
<div n="lb">compassion, however, adding to his curse that the person who
<div n="lb">would be able to answer his questions would deliver him, and
<div n="lb">that even stronger beings would, when seized by him, lose
<div n="lb">their strength. He had retained his recollection of his former
<div n="lb">existence, and nobody who came within his reach at the sixth
<div n="lb">division of the day ({%? ṣaṣṭhe kāle: aṣṭadhā vibhaktasyāhno%}
<div n="lb">{%bhāge,%} Nīl.) could escape him. Bhīma lamented. Now
<div n="lb">appeared dreadful omens to Yudhiṣṭhira there, and having
<div n="lb">learnt from Draupadī that Bhīma had long been out, he
<div n="lb">set out with Dhaumya, having directed Arjuna to protect
<div n="lb">Draupadī, and Nakula and Sahadeva to protect the
<div n="lb">brahmans; and in the east, following the tracks of Bhīma,
<div n="lb">he came to the spot (III, {@179@}). The serpent told Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira who he was, refused other food instead of Bhīma,
<div n="lb">but promised to deliver him if Yudhiṣṭhira could answer his
<div n="lb">questions. The first question was about the characteristics
<div n="lb">of the brahman, etc. (III, {@180@}). Yudhiṣṭhira asked the
<div n="lb">serpent some questions about the means of salvation, and
<div n="lb">some other moral and philosophical questions, about the
<div n="lb">difference between the mind {%(manas)%} and the intellect
<div n="lb">{%(buddhi),%} and what had caused Nahuṣa's fall. Nahuṣa
<div n="lb">told that in heaven he used to exact tribute from brah-
<div n="lb">marṣis, gods, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Pannagas,
<div n="lb">etc.; and that such was the spell of his eyes, that on
<div n="lb">whatever creature he fixed them he instantly destroyed its
<div n="lb">power; Agastya had foretold that Yudhiṣṭhira would save
<div n="lb">him from his curse. He delivered Bhīma unhurt, and,
<div n="lb">assuming his celestial shape, went back to heaven. Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira returned with Dhaumya and Bhīma, and narrated all
<div n="lb">that to the brahmans, who censured Bhīma, and warned him
<div n="lb">against attempting such things again (III, {@181@}).
