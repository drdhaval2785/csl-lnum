[{@Svayaṃvaraparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating how
<div n="lb">Draupadī chose herself a husband”, the 12th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Svayaṃvara). § 231. The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} went to the {%Pāñcāla%} land in the company of
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} who told them of the {%svayaṃvara,%} and of {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna,%} and {%Kṛṣṇā%} (I, {@184@}). On their way they beheld
<div n="lb">{%Dvaipāyana.%} They took up their quarters in the house of a
<div n="lb">potter, and adopting the brahmanical profession, they began
<div n="lb">to lead a mendicant life. {%Yajñasena%} (= Drupada) always
<div n="lb">cherished the wish of bestowing his daughter on {%Kirīṭin%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Arjuna), but never spoke of this wish to anybody. He
<div n="lb">therefore caused a very stiff bow to be made, which was
[Page672-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">incapable of being bent by anybody except {%Arjuna;%} and
<div n="lb">causing some machinery to be erected in the sky, he set up a
<div n="lb">mark attached to that machinery, and said: “He who with
<div n="lb">this bow and these arrows hits the mark shall obtain my
<div n="lb">daughter.” Among the kings that came were {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Kurus%} and {%Karṇa.%} The princes entered the arena
<div n="lb">by the north-eastern gate {%(śiśumāraśiraḥ prāpya).%} The arena
<div n="lb">was situated to the north-east of the capital (description of
<div n="lb">it). On the 16th day {%Draupadī,%} having bathed, entered
<div n="lb">the arena. Then the {%purohita%} of the {%Somakas%} gratified {%Agni.%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} possessing a voice deep as that of a kettle-
<div n="lb">drum or of the clouds, taking hold of his sister's arm, stood
<div n="lb">in the midst of the arena, and said: “Hit the mark by
<div n="lb">means of these five arrows.” Then he addressed his sister,
<div n="lb">reciting to her the names, etc. of the assembled princes
<div n="lb">(I, {@185@}).—§ 232. Enumeration (<lang n="greek"></lang>) of the assembled princes
<div n="lb">(I, {@186@}).—§ 233. There came also the {%devagaṇas%} on their
<div n="lb">chariots; the {%Rudras%} and the {%Ādityas,%} the {%Vasus%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Aśvins,%} the {%Sādhyas%} and all the {%Maruts,%} with {%Yama%} and
<div n="lb">{%Dhaneśvara%} (i.e. Kubera) walking ahead; and also the {%Daityas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Suparṇas,%} the {%mahoragas,%} the {%Devarṣis,%} the {%Guhyakas%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Cāraṇas, Viśvāvasu, Nārada%} and {%Parvata,%} the principal
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas%} with the {%Apsarases,%} and the {%Asuras%} and {%Siddhas%}
<div n="lb">(v. 7017), and {%Halāyudha%} (i.e. Balarāma), and {%Janārdana%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Kṛṣṇa), and the chiefs of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Yadus,%} always obedient to Kṛṣṇa. {%Kṛṣṇa%} pointed out the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} to his brother {%Rāma.%} When {%Duryodhana,%} the {%Cedi-%}
<div n="lb">king {%Śiśupāla%} (son of {%Damaghoṣa%}), {%Jarāsandha,%} the {%Madra-%}
<div n="lb">king {%Śalya,%} etc. had in vain tried to string the bow, and
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} though having succeeded in stringing it, had, as a {%sūta,%}
<div n="lb">been rejected by {%Kṛṣṇā, Jiṣṇu%} (i.e. Arjuna) came forward
<div n="lb">(I, {@187@}). Some of the brahmans spoke reproachingly of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna's%} daring undertaking, some approved of it (citing
<div n="lb">{%Paraśurāma%} and {%Agastya's%} drinking out of the Sea). {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">bending his head to {%Īśāna%} and remembering {%Kṛṣṇa,%} accom-
<div n="lb">plished the task. The gods showered celestial flowers.
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} was filled with joy. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with the twins
<div n="lb">returned home. {%Kṛṣṇā%} approached {%Arjuna,%} who soon after-
<div n="lb">wards left the lists followed by her (I, {@188@}).—§ 234. When
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} expressed his desire of bestowing his daughter on
<div n="lb">that {%brahman,%} the kings resolved to slay {%Drupada%} and burn
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇā,%} but spare {%Arjuna,%} whom they took for a {%brahman.%}
<div n="lb">They rushed at {%Drupada,%} who was defended by {%Arjuna%} with
<div n="lb">the bow and by {%Bhīma%} with a tree torn up by the root.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} then knew, and said to {%Balarāma%} that they must be
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} who had escaped from the fire (I, {@189@}).
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} was defeated by {%Arjuna%} (“accomplished in the {%Brāhma%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Paurandara%} weapons”, v. 7105), and the {%Madra-%}king
<div n="lb">{%Śalya%} by {%Bhīma;%} then {%Duryodhana,%} etc., who had been
<div n="lb">engaged with the {%brahmans,%} desisted from the combat, because
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} though offending, should yet always be protected.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said to them that those {%brahmans%} had justly acquired
<div n="lb">the maiden. The kings returned to their respective kingdoms.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna,%} with difficulty, escaped from the throng,
<div n="lb">followed by {%Kṛṣṇā.%}—§ 235. {%Kuntī%} was filled with anxiety,
<div n="lb">seeing that her sons were late in returning from their begging
<div n="lb">tour. Then, in the late afternoon, {%Jiṣṇu%} (i.e. Arjuna),
<div n="lb">accompanied by a body of {%brahmans,%} entered the abode of the
<div n="lb">{%Bhārgava%} (i.e. the potter, Nīl.) (I, {@190@}). {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">presented {%Kṛṣṇā%} as their “alms”, and {%Kuntī,%} not yet seeing
<div n="lb">them, said: “enjoy ye all.” Afterwards, she was alarmed
<div n="lb">at what she had said. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} declared that {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">should wed her; but {%Arjuna%} replied that it was a sin for the
[Page672-b+ 59]
<div n="lb">younger brother to marry before the elder. Meanwhile, they
<div n="lb">all fell in love with {%Kṛṣṇā.%} Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} recollected
<div n="lb">the words of {%Vyāsa,%} and, from fear of a division amongst the
<div n="lb">brothers, said that she should be the common wife of them
<div n="lb">all. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Balarāma%} then paid them a visit, and again
<div n="lb">went away (I, {@191@}).—§ 236: When {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">were turning towards the abode of the {%Bhārgava, Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna%} followed them and concealed himself in some part of
<div n="lb">the house. Then {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} and the twins returning
<div n="lb">from their begging tour in the evening, gave everything to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Kuntī%} caused {%Kṛṣṇā%} to distribute it, giving to
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} alone as much as to all the others, because he always
<div n="lb">ate much. Then they laid down for the night, and {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna%} overheard their conversations. In the morning
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} set out to report it to {%Drupada,%} who was sad,
<div n="lb">because he did not know, if perhaps a man of mean descent
<div n="lb">had taken away his daughter, though he thought it possible
<div n="lb">that it was Arjuna (I, {@192@}).
