[{@Indrota-Pārīkṣitīya(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the narrative of Indrota
<div n="lb">and Janamejaya Pārikṣit”). § 652{%b%} (Āpaddh.): {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said: There was, in days of yore, a king {%Pārikṣit%}
<div n="lb">(! so B.; C. {%°rī°%}) {%Janamejaya;%} from want of judgment he
<div n="lb">became guilty of killing a brahman; then all the brahmans,
<div n="lb">with his priests, abandoned him; burning day and night with
<div n="lb">regret, the king retired into the woods; deserted by his
<div n="lb">subjects also, and consumed by repentance, he underwent the
<div n="lb">most rigid austerities. In order to purify himself of the sin of
<div n="lb">brahmanicide he interrogated many brahmans, and wandered
<div n="lb">from country to country over the whole earth. One day he
<div n="lb">met {%Indrota Śaunaka,%} who rebuked him for his brahmanicide
<div n="lb">and reminded him of the messengers of {%Yama%} in the abode of
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} (XII, {@150@}). {%Janamejaya%} meekly listened to the reproof,
<div n="lb">saying that he was much afraid of {%Yama;%} he knew that,
<div n="lb">according to the Vedas, wretches like himself had forfeited all
<div n="lb">claim to the respect of the world, and had after death to
<div n="lb">dwell in hell like {%Pulindas%} and {%Śabaras%} (so C. and B.; PCR.
<div n="lb">{%Khasas%}), and he sought instruction from {%Indrota,%} who told him
<div n="lb">to repent and, knowing the Vedas, etc., act in such a way that
<div n="lb">the brahmans might not be angry with him; {%Śaunaka%} said
<div n="lb">that his kinsmen and friends would call him sinful because he
<div n="lb">instructed {%Janamejaya. Janamejaya%} swore never again to
<div n="lb">injure the brahmans (XII, {@151@}). {%Indrota%} discoursed to the
<div n="lb">repentant king on the means of cleansing himself, quoting
<div n="lb">a verse sung by {%Yayāti%} about the sacredness of {%Kurukṣetra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and recommending him to go to {%Mahāsaras,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">quoting also a saying of {%Manu%} and a verse of {%Satyavat.%}
<div n="lb">{%Mahāsaras,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), are so sacred that one guilty of fœticide
<div n="lb">becomes cleansed at even 100 yojanas from them. {%Manu%} has
<div n="lb">said that by diving in water after thrice reciting the {%Agha-%}
<div n="lb">{%marṣaṇa [mantras]%} (v. the note of PCR., p. 498), one reaps
<div n="lb">the fruits of the final bath in a horse-sacrifice. The gods and
<div n="lb">{%Asuras%} in days of yore were instructed by M.-ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati,%} the
<div n="lb">preceptor of the gods, how one should cleanse himself from
<div n="lb">sin. {%Indrota%} then assisted {%Janamejaya,%} cleansed of his sins, in
<div n="lb">the horse-sacrifice (XII, {@152@}).
