{@Bhīmasenarasapāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“Bhīma's drinking the magic
<div n="lb">draught”). § 197 (Sambhavap.): The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were far
<div n="lb">superior in strength and skill to the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} tormented the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras. Duryodhana%} then built
<div n="lb">a palace {%(Udakakrīḍana)%} at {%Pramāṇakoṭi,%} on the banks of
<div n="lb">the {%Gaṅgā,%} in order to sport in the water there. There he
<div n="lb">invited the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and poured {%kālakūṭaka%} poison into the
<div n="lb">food of {%Bhīma,%} and when {%Bhīma%} had lost his senses, {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">bound him and threw him into the water, where he sunk
<div n="lb">down to the dwelling of the {%Nāgas,%} who bit him, but could
<div n="lb">not penetrate his thick skin. The immovable (i.e. vegetable)
<div n="lb">{%kālakūṭaka%} poison was neutralised by the movable (i.e. animal)
<div n="lb">serpent poison. {%Bhīma%} awoke and began to crush the serpents,
<div n="lb">until {%Vāsuki%} came, and, informed by {%Āryaka%} that he was the
<div n="lb">daughter's son of {%Āryaka's%} daughter's son, let him drink
<div n="lb">as much of their {%rasa%} (containing the strength of 1,000
<div n="lb">elephants (serpents?) in each {%kuṇḍa%}) as he could. He drank
<div n="lb">eight {%kuṇḍas,%} and then was laid on a bed (I, {@128@}). When
<div n="lb">the {%Kauravas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} had returned to {%Hāstinapura,%}
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira (“himself unacquainted with wickedness, and
<div n="lb">regarding others as honest as himself,” v. 5037) asked {%Kuntī%}
<div n="lb">if {%Bhīma%} had come home. {%Vidura%} consoled her. On the eighth
<div n="lb">day {%Bhīma%} awoke from his slumber, bathed in the holy waters,
<div n="lb">ate of the {%paramānna%} (rice boiled in milk with sugar),
<div n="lb">etc., and was placed by the {%Nāgas%} in the same gardens,
<div n="lb">whence he ran home. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ordered him to keep
<div n="lb">silence on this accident, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} [with {%Vidura's%}
<div n="lb">advice] became very vigilant from this day (the words in
<div n="lb">brackets are from B., where also v. 5068{%a%} is placed after
<div n="lb">v. 5070{%a%}). [{%sārathiṃ cāsya dayitam apahastena jaghnivān%}
<div n="lb">(see BR., s.v. {%apahasta,%} cf. iii, v. 545). {%Duryodhana%} again
<div n="lb">poured {%kālakūṭaka%} poison into the food of {%Bhīma. Yuyutsu%}
<div n="lb">informed the {%Pāṇḍavas%} of this; but {%Bhīma%} swallowed the
<div n="lb">poison and digested it, and it produced no change in him.]—
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana, Karṇa,%} and {%Śakuni%} had recourse to numerous
<div n="lb">other contrivances in order to kill the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} who, though
<div n="lb">knowing it, yet, in accordance with the advice of {%Vidura,%}
<div n="lb">suppressed their indignation. Seeing the princes passing their
<div n="lb">time in play, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} appointed {%Gautama%} (i.e. {%Kṛpa,%}
<div n="lb">born in a thicket of reeds and well skilled in the meaning
<div n="lb">of the {%Vedas%} and {%śāstras%}) as their preceptor (I, {@129@}).
