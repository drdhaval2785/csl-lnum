{@Medhāvin@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ son of Bāladhi. § 415 (Tīrthayātrāp.): In
<div n="lb">ancient times the muni {%Bāladhi%} practised austerities in order
<div n="lb">to have an immortal son. He obtained a son {%Medhāvin%} of
<div n="lb">a very irritable temper, but the gods did not make him
<div n="lb">immortal; they only granted the boon that he should live
<div n="lb">as long as the mountains existed. {%Medhāvin%} grew haughty,
<div n="lb">and insulted the munis. The learned {%Dhanuṣākṣa%} then
<div n="lb">cursed him, saying, “Be thou reduced to ashes.” When,
<div n="lb">however, {%Medhāvin%} was not reduced to ashes, {%Dhānuṣākṣa%}
<div n="lb">caused the mountains to be scattered by buffaloes, and then
<div n="lb">{%Medhāvin%} perished. As his father bewailed him, the munis
<div n="lb">quoted the following gāthā: “A mortal on no condition can
<div n="lb">overcome what has been ordained by fate,” etc.: III, {@135,@}
<div n="lb">10740, 10742—3.
