<div n="lb">§ 643{%b%} (Āpaddh.): There was a robber {%Kāyavya,%} born of
<div n="lb">a {%Kṣatriya%} father and a {%Niṣāda%} mother. {%K.%} was a practiser
<div n="lb">of {%kṣatriya%} duties, conversant with the scriptures, free
<div n="lb">from cruelty, devoted to the {%brahmans,%} etc. Morning and
<div n="lb">evening he went deer-hunting; he was well conversant with
<div n="lb">all the practices of the {%Niṣādas,%} and of all animals living
<div n="lb">in the forest, etc. Alone he could vanquish many hundreds
<div n="lb">of soldiers. He worshipped his old, blind, and deaf parents
<div n="lb">in the forest every day, etc. One day many thousands of
<div n="lb">robbers made him their leader, promising not to slay women,
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} etc. By abstaining from sin they obtained great
<div n="lb">prosperity. {%Kāyavya,%} though a robber, still succeeded in
<div n="lb">winning felicity in heaven* (XII, {@135@}).
