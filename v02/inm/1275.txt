[{@Bhagavadyānaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">journey of Kṛṣṇa,” the 62nd of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Bhagavadyāna). § 562: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke
<div n="lb">to {%Kṛṣṇa%} about the mission of {%Sañjaya%} and the wickedness of
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra;%} though he was supported by
<div n="lb">the {%Kāśis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), he asked for only five villages ({%Avisthala,%}
<div n="lb">etc., <lang n="greek"></lang>) or towns, and complained of the cruel duties of the
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriya%} order. {%Kṛṣṇa%} said he was willing to go to the
<div n="lb">{%Kuru%} court in order to negotiate a peace, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">after some hesitation, agreed to the proposal (V, {@72@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">mentioned the offences of the {%Kauravas,%} and said that he
<div n="lb">thought war to be certain; all the omens pointed in that
[Page115-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">direction; therefore {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should collect everything
<div n="lb">needed for battle (V, {@73@}). {%Bhīma%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to speak
<div n="lb">mildly and not threaten the {%Kurus%} with war. “Just as,
<div n="lb">when {%Dharma%} became extinct, {%Kali%} was born in the race of
<div n="lb">the {%Asuras,%} who flourished with prosperity and blazed with
<div n="lb">energy, so was {%Udāvarta%} born among the {%Haihayas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">These vile individuals sprang up, at the end of each {%yuga,%} in
<div n="lb">their respective races for the destruction of their kinsmen; so
<div n="lb">has {%Duryodhana%} been born at the end of the {%yuga%} among us the
<div n="lb">{%Kurus. Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna%} too are averse from war”
<div n="lb">(V, {@74@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} scoffed at {%Bhīma%} for his unusual mildness,
<div n="lb">though he had sworn, as the sun journeyed around {%Meru,%} to
<div n="lb">slay {%Duryodhana%} with his mace (V, {@75@}). {%Bhīma%} mentioned
<div n="lb">his well-known valour, and said that he was for bearing their
<div n="lb">injuries, only for fear lest the {%Bharata%} race might be extirpated
<div n="lb">(V, {@76@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} explained that he had only spoken through
<div n="lb">affection (V, {@77@}). {%Arjuna%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to strive sincerely
<div n="lb">to bring about peace; for he was able to do whatever he
<div n="lb">would; but if {%Kṛṣṇa%} deemed the destruction of the {%Kurus%}
<div n="lb">to be preferable, “let it be effected soon”; he mentioned
<div n="lb">the offences of {%Duryodhana%} towards themselves and {%Draupadī.%}
<div n="lb">At all events, {%Kṛṣṇa%} best knew what was for their good
<div n="lb">(V, {@78@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said he would try to bring about what was
<div n="lb">beneficial to both the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Kurus;%} to make
<div n="lb">peace was within his power; he would do all that could be
<div n="lb">done by human exertion, but he could not control destiny;
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would never make peace by giving
<div n="lb">up the kingdom; many a time he had tried to withdraw
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} from {%Arjuna;%} about a year ago, on the occasion of
<div n="lb">attacking {%Virāṭa's%} kine, {%Bhīṣma%} had solicited {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">about this very peace (V, {@79@}). {%Nakula%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to
<div n="lb">act according to his own opinion, disregarding all he
<div n="lb">had heard. Their attachment for the kingdom was now
<div n="lb">greater than ever, as nobody could encounter {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). He should first speak mildly and then threaten
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana.%} He did not doubt that he would accomplish his
<div n="lb">object, for {%Vidura,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would understand him (V, {@80@}).
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva%} said that {%Kṛṣṇa%} ought to provoke a war, because
<div n="lb">of the insults to {%Draupadī. Sātyaki%} approved of this, and
<div n="lb">thus did all the heroes present (V, {@81@}). {%Kṛṣṇā%} approved of
<div n="lb">the words of {%Sahadeva%} and {%Sātyaki,%} mentioned weeping the
<div n="lb">injustice of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} and that they had refused
<div n="lb">to give even five villages, {%Avisthala,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and was of opinion
<div n="lb">that there was no necessity for going thither in order to make
<div n="lb">peace. {%Kṛṣṇa%} consoled her: “Thou wilt soon see thy
<div n="lb">husbands slay their enemies, and crowned by prosperity”
<div n="lb">(V, {@82@}). {%Arjuna%} once more besought {%Kṛṣṇa%} to try to
<div n="lb">make peace. On the next morning, at the {%Maitra%} hour, in
<div n="lb">the month of {%Kaumuda%} (Kārttika), under the constellation
<div n="lb">{%Revatī,%} at the season of dews, Autumn having departed
<div n="lb">(description), {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused {%Śini's%} grandson {%Sātyaki%} to
<div n="lb">prepare his chariot (description); they yoked to it {%Śaibya,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa,%} and {%Balāhaka. Garuḍa%} came and
<div n="lb">perched on the flagstaff. And taking {%Sātyaki%} also upon it,
<div n="lb">he set out under auspicious omens; {%Vasiṣṭha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and
<div n="lb">D.-ṛ. and B.-ṛ. {%(devabrahmarṣayaś caiva)%} walked around him
<div n="lb">{%(pradakṣiṇam avartanta). Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), followed
<div n="lb">him on the way, and told him to salute {%Kuntī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">said he was for peace, but if {%Duryodhana%} would not give them
<div n="lb">what they demanded, he would annihilate the {%Kṣattriya%}
<div n="lb">race. {%Bhīma%} uttered a terrible shout, so that the bowmen
<div n="lb">trembled in fear, and steeds and elephants were seen to void
<div n="lb">urine and fæces. When all the kings had desisted following
[Page115-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">him, {%Kṛṣṇa%} set out with {%Dāruka.%} On his way he met with
<div n="lb">some {%Ṛṣis,%} and {%Jamadagni's%} son, the friend of {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">{%(Surāsurapāteḥ),%} told him that the D.-ṛ., {%brahmans,%} and R.-ṛ.,
<div n="lb">who had witnessed the former feats of gods and {%Asuras%}
<div n="lb">{%(devāsurasya draṣṭāraḥ purāṇasya),%} had come to see and hear
<div n="lb">the assemblage at {%Hāstinapura%} (V, {@83@}). Ten chariot-warriors
<div n="lb">followed in {%Kṛṣṇa's%} train, and 100 foot-soldiers and
<div n="lb">attendants by hundreds, carrying provisions in abundance.
<div n="lb">Sinister omens occurred over {%Hāstinapura;%} but where
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} passed everything became auspicious. At {%Vṛkasthala%}
<div n="lb">he passed the night (V, {@84@}). Meanwhile {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">having heard from his spies that {%Kṛṣṇa%} was coming, respect-
<div n="lb">fully addressed {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and said to {%Duryodhana%} and
<div n="lb">his counsellors that {%Kṛṣṇa%} (“the lord of all creatures,” etc.)
<div n="lb">should be received with the greatest honour; “let pavilions
<div n="lb">be set up on the road,” etc. {%Bhīṣma,%} etc., approved of it,
<div n="lb">and {%Duryodhana%} made the arrangements. But {%Kṛṣṇa%} did
<div n="lb">not even glance at it (V, {@85@}). When {%Kṛṣṇa%} was staying
<div n="lb">at {%Vṛkasthala%} and intended to come to {%Hāstinapura%} the next
<div n="lb">morning, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} spoke to {%Vidura%} about how he in-
<div n="lb">tended to treat {%Kṛṣṇa%} in order to honour him (V, {@86@}).
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} blamed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} for his insincerity; “the right
<div n="lb">hospitality to be offered to {%Kṛṣṇa%} is to make peace with the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} and thou wilt not give them even five villages,
<div n="lb">and seekest only to separate {%Kṛṣṇa%} from the {%Pāṇḍavas%}”
<div n="lb">(V, {@87@}). {%Duryodhana%} said that it was of no use to bestow
<div n="lb">wealth and honour upon {%Kṛṣṇa,%} as he could never be separated
<div n="lb">from the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} “and he will only think that we are
<div n="lb">worshipping him out of fear.” {%Bhīṣma%} advised them to do
<div n="lb">as {%Kṛṣṇa%} would say. {%Duryodhana%} declared that he would
<div n="lb">imprison {%Kṛṣṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and all his counsellors
<div n="lb">became deeply afflicted, especially as {%Kṛṣṇa%} came as an
<div n="lb">ambassador. Inflamed with rage, {%Bhīṣma%} rose and left the
<div n="lb">place (V, {@88@}). The next morning {%Kṛṣṇa%} rose at daybreak
<div n="lb">and arrived in {%Hāstinapura,%} and was solemnly received by all
<div n="lb">the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} (except {%Duryodhana%}), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the
<div n="lb">citizens (description). Having saluted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">he went to the abode of {%Vidura%} (V, {@89@}). In the afternoon
<div n="lb">he visited {%Kuntī,%} who wept for her sons, comparing {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} to {%Ambarīṣa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), mentioning the feats of {%Bhīma-%}
<div n="lb">{%sena%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), comparing {%Arjuna%} to {%Kārtavīrya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and also
<div n="lb">inquiring about {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula,%} and likewise about
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} (whom she had not seen for fourteen long years),
<div n="lb">mentioning how she was dragged by {%Duḥśāsana,%} while
<div n="lb">{%Bāhlika,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), grieved; but especially she praised {%Vidura.%}
<div n="lb">“Full 14 years have gone since {%Duryodhana%} first exiled my
<div n="lb">son.” She mentioned the invisible voice on the night of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna's%} birth, and trusted to {%Dharma%} and the Creator and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa.%} She asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to tell her sons that she besought
<div n="lb">them to avenge themselves and {%Draupadī,%} as even death was
<div n="lb">better than a life gained by meanness. {%Kṛṣṇa%} consoled her,
<div n="lb">and then departed for {%Duryodhana's%} mansion (V, {@90@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">entered {%Duryodhana's%} palace (description), where he also beheld
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana, Karṇa,%} and {%Śakuni. Duryodhana%} asked him to
<div n="lb">dine at his house; but {%Kṛṣṇa%} did not accept the invitation,
<div n="lb">because he hated the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and went to {%Vidura's%} abode,
<div n="lb">where {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came to him (V, {@91@}). {%Vidura%} warned
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} against {%Duryodhana,%} who would never make peace,
<div n="lb">because he trusted {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and distrusted {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">(V, {@92@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that he knew {%Duryodhana;%} but great
<div n="lb">would be the merit earned by him who liberates the whole
<div n="lb">earth from the noose of death; and even if he should meet
<div n="lb">failure, the merit of that intended act would become his;
[Page116-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">“moreover, I have come here in order that unrighteous,
<div n="lb">foolish, and inimical persons shall not afterwards be free to
<div n="lb">say that {%Kṛṣṇa%} made no attempt to restrain them from
<div n="lb">slaughtering one another, though he was competent to do
<div n="lb">so.” Then he laid himself down for sleep (V, {@93@}). In the
<div n="lb">morning {%Duryodhana%} and {%Śakūni%} came and invited him to go
<div n="lb">to the council where {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Bhīṣma,%} etc., were
<div n="lb">present; he rode thither in his chariot with {%Dāruka,%} putting
<div n="lb">on his gem {%Kaustubha,%} and being protected by the {%Vṛṣṇis,%}
<div n="lb">and he was followed by {%Vidura%} in his own chariot, and by
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} and {%Śakuni%} in one chariot, and by {%Sātyaki%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛtavarman%} and the other chariot-warriors of the {%Vṛṣṇi%} race
<div n="lb">in chariots and on steeds and elephants (description). Then
<div n="lb">he entered the court with {%Vidura%} and {%Sātyaki;%} before him
<div n="lb">sat {%Karṇa%} and {%Duryodhana,%} behind him the {%Vṛṣṇis%} with
<div n="lb">{%Kṛtavarman. Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} etc., with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} rose
<div n="lb">up in his honour, etc. He beheld the {%Ṛṣis%} staying in the
<div n="lb">skies with {%Nārada%} at their head, and caused {%Bhīṣma%} to offer
<div n="lb">them seats. {%Duḥśāsana%} gave a seat to {%Sātyaki,%} and {%Viviṃśati%}
<div n="lb">one to {%Kṛtavarman%} (V, {@94@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} spoke of the just
<div n="lb">complaints and claims of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and said that with
<div n="lb">them as his allies {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} would become invincible,
<div n="lb">having {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “Let not the peoples of the earth
<div n="lb">be exterminated! If thou regainest thy natural disposition,
<div n="lb">the earth may continue to be peopled as now.” All the kings
<div n="lb">there present highly applauded the words of {%Kṛṣṇa%} in their
<div n="lb">hearts, but none of them ventured to say anything in the
<div n="lb">presence of {%Duryodhana%} (V, {@95@}).—§ 563: {%Jāmadagnya%} then
<div n="lb">told Dambhodbhavopākhyāna (q.v.). “Great, indeed, was
<div n="lb">that feat of old achieved by {%Nara. Nārāyaṇa%} again became
<div n="lb">superior to {%Nara%} in consequence of many additional qualities.
<div n="lb">Therefore, O king, before such weapons as {%Kākudika,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">are placed on the string of the {%Gāṇḍīva,%} go thou to
<div n="lb">{%Dhanañjaya,%} laying aside thy pride!” These weapons have
<div n="lb">other names corresponding to the eight passions (lust,
<div n="lb">wrath, etc.; description) (V, {@96@}).—§ 564: Mātalīyopā—
<div n="lb">khyāna (q.v.).—§ 565: After {%Kaṇva%} had spoken, {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} and {%Nārada%} in vain admonished {%Duryodhana. Nārada%}
<div n="lb">related the old story Gālavacarita (q.v.), and—§ 566: The
<div n="lb">fall of {%Yayāti%} (q.v.).—§ 567: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained that
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} never listened to his, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), words, and asked
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} to admonish him. {%Kṛṣṇa%} reminded {%Duryodhana%} of
<div n="lb">what was agreeable to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and warned him
<div n="lb">against {%Duḥśāsana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), could not fight
<div n="lb">against {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna,%} who had vanquished D., G., Y.,
<div n="lb">As., and Pn. at {%Khāṇḍavaprastha;%} who encountered many at
<div n="lb">{%Virāṭa's%} city, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@124@}). {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Vidura,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} recommended {%Duryodhana%} to follow the
<div n="lb">counsels of {%Kṛṣṇa%} (V, {@125@}). {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%} warned
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} against {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@126@}). {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">complained that {%Kṛṣṇa%} always censured him; in the match of
<div n="lb">dice blame could not be attached to him. He quoted this saying
<div n="lb">of {%Mātaṅga,%} “one should always keep himself erect…”
<div n="lb">(V, {@127@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} indignantly answered {%Duryodhana,%} men-
<div n="lb">tioning his offences against the {%Pāṇḍavas, Vāraṇāvata,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana%} said to {%Duryodhana%} that the {%Kauravas%} would bind
<div n="lb">him, and {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} would make
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana, Karṇa,%} and {%Duḥśāsana%} over to the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}
<div n="lb">Disregarding {%Vidura,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Duryodhana%} went out of the
<div n="lb">court in anger. {%Kṛṣṇa%} blamed them for not having forcibly
<div n="lb">seized and bound {%Duryodhana;%} “I think the time has come
<div n="lb">for doing this”; he reminded them of how he had himself
<div n="lb">slain {%Kaṃsa,%} and then installed {%Ugrasena%} on the throne, for
[Page116-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">the benefit of all the {%Yādavas, Andhakas,%} and {%Vṛṣṇis;%} and
<div n="lb">that when the gods and {%Asuras,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were arrayed for
<div n="lb">battle {%Parameṣṭhin%} had commanded {%Dharma%} to bind the
<div n="lb">{%Daiteyas%} and the {%Dānavas%} and make them over to {%Varuṇa,%}
<div n="lb">who having bound them with {%Dharma's%} noose and also with
<div n="lb">his own, kept them within the depths of the ocean. In the
<div n="lb">same way they ought to bind {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@128@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} caused {%Vidura%} to fetch {%Gāndhārī,%} who blamed
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} because he had by his indulgence caused
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} now to be the slave of delusion and incapable
<div n="lb">of being turned back; she then caused {%Vidura%} to fetch
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} whom she rebuked severely and asked to obey
<div n="lb">the words of his well-wishers {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Bāhlīka%} [formerly] gave
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} their share from fear of a disunion. If
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), became enraged the population of the earth
<div n="lb">would be exterminated. The affection of {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa%} towards the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} was equal;
<div n="lb">“it is never seen in this world that men acquire wealth by
<div n="lb">avarice” (V, {@129@}). Disregarding the words of his mother,
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} again went away in anger, and began to consult
<div n="lb">with {%Śakuni,%} and {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), resolved upon seizing
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa;%} then the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with the {%Somakas%} would become
<div n="lb">depressed. {%Sātyaki%} knew it, caused {%Kṛtavarman%} to array the
<div n="lb">troops at the entrance of the court, and informed {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and {%Vidura,%} but laughed at the project.
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that the last hour of all his sons
<div n="lb">was at hand. {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that if his sons
<div n="lb">perpetrated such a deed {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} object would be
<div n="lb">accomplished, “for this very day, seizing them with all who
<div n="lb">follow them, I can make them over to the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} I will
<div n="lb">not, however, commit any such censurable deed that can
<div n="lb">proceed only from wrath and a sinful understanding.”
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} once more caused {%Vidura%} to fetch {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">with his brothers, etc., and rebuked them; “dost thou not
<div n="lb">know {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who is incapable of being defeated in battle by
<div n="lb">D., men, G., As., and U.?” {%Vidura%} reminded {%Duryodhana%} that
<div n="lb">at the gates of {%Saubha%} the monkey {%Dvivida%} covered {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">with a shower of stones, but could not seize him; nor could
<div n="lb">{%Naraka%} with all the {%Dānavas%} at {%Prāgjyotiṣa;%} slaying {%Naraka,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} brought away 1,000 damsels and married them all.
<div n="lb">In the city of {%Nirmocana%} 6,000 mighty {%Asuras%} failed to
<div n="lb">seize him with their nooses. He also mentioned {%Pūtanā%}
<div n="lb">{%Śakunī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@130@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} reminded {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">that he was not alone, and from his body issued myriads of
<div n="lb">gods, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); all the kings were terrified and closed their
<div n="lb">eyes, except {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Vidura, Sañjaya,%} and the {%Ṛṣis;%}
<div n="lb">for {%Kṛṣṇa%} gave them celestial sight, etc. Then he went
<div n="lb">out with {%Sātyaki%} and {%Kṛtavarman.%} The {%Ṛṣis Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">etc., vanished. He found {%Dāruka%} waiting with his chariot
<div n="lb">(description) drawn by {%Śaibya,%} and {%Kṛtavarman,%} who had
<div n="lb">mounted his chariot. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} excused himself, saying
<div n="lb">that he was powerless. {%Kṛṣṇa%} bade farewell to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and set out, followed by {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), to the
<div n="lb">abode of {%Kuntī%} (V, {@131@}). {%Kuntī%} asked him to admonish
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to attend to the duties of his own order, and not
<div n="lb">contemplate virtue alone (“thy virtue is decreasing greatly”),
<div n="lb">citing {%Mucukunda (b).%} It is the king that creates the {%Kṛta,%}
<div n="lb">{%Tretā,%} or {%Dvāpara%} age; if he creates the {%Kṛta%} age, he enjoys
<div n="lb">heaven exceedingly; if he creates the {%Tretā,%} he enjoys
<div n="lb">heaven, but not exceedingly; if he causes the {%Dvāpara%} age
<div n="lb">to set in, he enjoys heaven according to his due; if he
<div n="lb">promotes the {%Kali%} age, he will reside in hell for countless
[Page117-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">years. “That understanding according to which thou art
<div n="lb">now acting, is not in accordance with the intentions of
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍu,%} or myself, or thy grandsire, when we uttered blessings
<div n="lb">on thee before,” etc. (V, {@132@}). “In this connection is cited
<div n="lb">an old story: § 568. Vidulāputraśāsana” (q.v.).—§ 569:
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to remind {%Arjuna%} of the voice heard at
<div n="lb">his birth (that he should rival {%Indra,%} vanquish the {%Kurus,%}
<div n="lb">conquer the earth aided by {%Bhīma;%} slay the {%Kurus%} in battle
<div n="lb">with {%Kṛṣṇa%} as his ally, and recover his share in the
<div n="lb">kingdom, and, with his brothers, perform three great sacri-
<div n="lb">fices); to {%Bhīma%} he should say that “the time has come
<div n="lb">for that in view of which a {%kṣattriya%} lady brings forth
<div n="lb">a son”; {%Kṛṣṇā%} he should praise for her behaviour towards
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} he should remind {%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva,%} that
<div n="lb">they must not forgive the insults towards {%Draupadī,%} that was
<div n="lb">worse than the defeat at dice and the exile; {%Arjuna%} should
<div n="lb">always tread in the path pointed out by {%Draupadī; Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">and {%Arjuna%} are a pair of {%Yamas%} capable of slaying the very
<div n="lb">gods; they should revenge the harsh words said by {%Duḥśāsana%}
<div n="lb">to {%Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa%} bade farewell to {%Bhīṣma,%} etc., took
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} upon his chariot and set out with {%Sātyaki,%} deliberating
<div n="lb">with {%Karṇa%} for a long time. Then he dismissed {%Karṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">driven by {%Dāruka%} the steeds soon reached {%Upaplavya.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Kurus%} assembled and talked about {%Kṛṣṇa%} (V, {@137@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">and {%Droṇa%} reminded {%Duryodhana%} of what {%Kuntī%} had said to
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} and the exploits of {%Arjuna;%} they recommended
<div n="lb">peace; fearful omens appeared (V, {@138@}). {%Duryodhana%} was
<div n="lb">cheerless and silent. {%Bhīṣma%} complained. {%Droṇa%} said that
<div n="lb">his affection for {%Arjuna%} was greater than for {%Aśvatthāman;%}
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} ought to have followed the counsels of the
<div n="lb">elders; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was invincible; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had
<div n="lb">procured wealth from {%Kubera's%} abode; “the periods of our
<div n="lb">lives have run out”; etc. (V, {@139@}). Requested by
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related the conversation between
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Karṇa%} (see the note of PCR.). {%Kṛṣṇa%} disclosed
<div n="lb">to {%Karṇa%} that he was virtually the son of {%Pāṇḍu,%} and on the
<div n="lb">side of his father was related to the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} on the side of
<div n="lb">his mother to the {%Vṛṣṇis.%} He ought to come with him to
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} being the elder brother of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and be
<div n="lb">installed as king by {%Dhaumya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} being
<div n="lb">his heir-presumptive and ruling the kingdom under him;
<div n="lb">“during the sixth period {%Draupadī%} also will come to thee”;
<div n="lb">“let the {%Draviḍas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), walk before thee” (V, {@140@}).
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} admitted that he was virtually the son of {%Pāṇḍu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī%} having, while a maiden, born him to {%Sūrya%} and then
<div n="lb">abandoned him. But the {%Sūta Adhiratha%} had taken him to
<div n="lb">his home; from her affection for him {%Rādhā's%} breasts were
<div n="lb">filled with milk that very day, and she held his urine and
<div n="lb">fæces; “how can one like us….deprive her
<div n="lb">of her {%piṇḍa?%}” {%Adhiratha%} regarded {%Karṇa%} as a son, and
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} regarded {%Adhiratha%} as a father; he had caused all the
<div n="lb">rites of infancy to be performed on {%Karṇa%} according to the
<div n="lb">scriptures; he had caused the name {%Vasuṣeṇa%} to be bestowed
<div n="lb">upon him by the {%brahmans;%} when {%Karṇa%} attained to youth he
<div n="lb">married wives according to {%Adhiratha's%} selection; with them
<div n="lb">he had begotten sons and grandsons. Through {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">he had enjoyed sovereignty for thirteen years. His many sacri-
<div n="lb">fices had always been with {%Sūtas,%} as had also his family rites
<div n="lb">and marriage rites. It was only after having got hold of
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} that {%Duryodhana%} had decided upon war with the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas, Karṇa%} having been chosen as the antagonist of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna.%} Their discourse ought to be kept secret, lest {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} should refuse to accept the kingdom; and “if the empire
[Page117-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">becomes mine I shall certainly make it over to {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">only.” He praised {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the weapons of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), comparing the combat to a sacrifice; and {%Bhīma's%}
<div n="lb">drinking the blood of {%Duḥśāsana%} to the {%Soma%}-drinking, etc.
<div n="lb">(V, {@141@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said the victory of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} was very
<div n="lb">certain; he described {%Arjuna's%} banner, made by {%Bhaumana%} by
<div n="lb">celestial illusion; his {%Aindra, Āgneya,%} and {%Māruta%} weapons,
<div n="lb">etc.; “then all signs of the {%Kṛta, Tretā,%} and {%Dvāpara%} ages
<div n="lb">will disappear.” He forebade {%Bhīmasena's%} dancing, having
<div n="lb">quaffed the blood of {%Duḥśāsana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “Returning hence,
<div n="lb">say to {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), that the present month is a
<div n="lb">delightful one; 7 days hence it will be the day of the new
<div n="lb">moon, presided over by {%Indra;%} let the battle commence then”
<div n="lb">(V, {@142@}). {%Karṇa%} ascribed the approaching destruction to
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and mentioned diverse sinister visions of
<div n="lb">planets (<lang n="greek"></lang>), etc., and he had seen in a vision, foreboding
<div n="lb">victory, {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the inverse respecting
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “{%Karṇa%} embraced {%Kṛṣṇa,%} descended
<div n="lb">from his chariot, and riding in his own chariot, which was
<div n="lb">decked with gold, came back with us” (V, {@143@}). {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">approached {%Kuntī%} and spoke of the state and disposition of
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the allies of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī%} thought with grief on those who were going to
<div n="lb">fight (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Especially she was afraid of {%Karṇa;%} she
<div n="lb">recollected the boon of {%Durvāsas%} and its consequences (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">She went to {%Karṇa,%} who was standing performing his
<div n="lb">prayers on the bank of {%Gaṅgā%} with his face turned towards
<div n="lb">the east and his arms upraised; and she stayed behind him,
<div n="lb">waiting for the completion of his prayers. Then, turning
<div n="lb">round, he beheld {%Kuntī%} (V, {@144@}). {%Kuntī%} disclosed to {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">his birth, mentioned the justice of the {%Pāṇḍava%} cause and
<div n="lb">the injustice of {%Duryodhana's,%} and besought him to join the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} (V, {@145@}). {%Sūrya%} corroborated the words of {%Kuntī.%}
<div n="lb">But {%Karṇa%} represented to her the great injury she had done
<div n="lb">him; he could not now frustrate the hope of the {%Kauravas;%}
<div n="lb">but “except {%Arjuna%} thy other sons shall not be slain by me.”
<div n="lb">They then left the spot, turning into different directions
<div n="lb">(V, {@146@}). At {%Upaplavya Kṛṣṇa%} represented to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">all that had happened at {%Hāstinapura.%} In the night, {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} again brought {%Kṛṣṇa%} into their midst, and caused him
<div n="lb">to repeat what had been said by {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">had related his own life (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he mentioned a duel with
<div n="lb">{%Rāma [Jāmadagnya],%} where {%Vicitravīrya%} fled, having
<div n="lb">been deserted by his subjects; upon {%Vicitravīrya's%} death
<div n="lb">anarchy prevailed in the kingdom, and {%Indra%} did not give
<div n="lb">a drop of rain; afflicted by hunger and maladies (very few
<div n="lb">of them were still alive), the subjects then asked {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">—in vain—to ascend the throne; “when {%Pāṇḍu%} became king,
<div n="lb">his sons must obtain their paternal inheritance” (V, {@147@}).
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} had related the life of {%Pāṇḍu. Vidura%} had asked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} to go to the woods with him and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} or
<div n="lb">to bind {%Duryodhana%} and rule the kingdom with the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} proved that the kingdom by right belonged to the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and their sons and grandsons, and to no others
<div n="lb">(V, {@148@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had repeated to {%Duryodhana%} the
<div n="lb">genealogy of the {%Kuru%} race from {%Soma,%} mentioning especially
<div n="lb">that {%Yayāti (b)%} had placed his youngest son {%Pūru%} on the
<div n="lb">throne; and that {%Devāpi's%} installation was forbidden by the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} and all aged persons because of a skin disease
<div n="lb">(leprosy, Nīl.), and as {%Bāhlika%} abandoned his father and
<div n="lb">brother and obtained the wealthy kingdom of his maternal
<div n="lb">uncle, {%Śāntanu,%} the youngest of the three brothers, became
<div n="lb">king. “Being defective of a limb, I was likewise excluded
[Page118-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">by {%Pāṇḍu;%} at his death the kingdom must pass to his sons
<div n="lb">…thou art not the son of a king, and therefore hast
<div n="lb">no right to the kingdom” (V, {@149@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} continued his
<div n="lb">relation; {%Duryodhana%} had repeatedly instructed the kings,
<div n="lb">saying: “To-day is {%Puṣya%} [in conjunction with the moon];
<div n="lb">march ye.” “Eleven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} have been assembled headed
<div n="lb">by {%Bhīṣma%} (with the device of the palmyra in his banner)”
<div n="lb">(V, {@150@}).
