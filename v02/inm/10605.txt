[{@Suvarṇotpatti@}]¦ (“the origin of gold”). § 747{%b%} (Anuśā-
<div n="lb">sanik.). {%Vasiṣṭha%} told to {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%} (and again
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}): After the wedding of {%Rudra%} and
<div n="lb">{%Devī%} on {%Himavat,%} all the gods, fearing that {%Rudra's%} offspring
[Page668-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">would consume the worlds, prevailed upon him to withdraw
<div n="lb">his vital seed (whence he is called {%Ūrdhvaretas%}); {%Umā%} cursed
<div n="lb">the gods, saying that they should become sonless; but {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">was not present. A small quantity of {%Rudra's%} seed, however,
<div n="lb">leaped into {%fire%} and began to develop; mean while, the gods,
<div n="lb">with {%Indra,%} were scorched by As. {%Tāraka;%} Ā., V., R., M., A.,
<div n="lb">and Sā. all became afflicted; all the regions of the deities, etc.,
<div n="lb">and the retreats of Ṛ. were snatched away by As.; D. and Ṛ.
<div n="lb">repaired to {%Brahmán%} (XIII, {@84@}), who had granted {%Tāraka%}
<div n="lb">the boon that he should not be killed by D., As., or Rā., and
<div n="lb">{%Umā%} had cursed D.; {%Brahmán%} said that {%Agni%} was not there;
<div n="lb">therefore his offspring, transcending D., Dā., Rā., even G.,
<div n="lb">N., and birds, will with his dart destroy {%Tāraka; Kāma%} is
<div n="lb">eternal, and in order to slay the enemies of the gods {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">will throw {%Rudra's%} seed into the {%Gaṅgā.%} The gods failed to
<div n="lb">find out {%Agni;%} a frog, having been scorched by the energy of
<div n="lb">{%Agni,%} appeared on the surface of the water, and said to the
<div n="lb">gods that {%Agni%} was now under the water; {%Agni,%} leaving the
<div n="lb">spot, cursed the frogs, saying that they should be without taste;
<div n="lb">the gods granted them boons (enumeration). An elephant
<div n="lb">revealed to the gods that {%Agni%} was now residing within a
<div n="lb">certain {%aśvattha%} tree; {%Agni,%} entering the heart of the {%śamī%}
<div n="lb">tree, cursed all the elephants, saying that their tongues should
<div n="lb">be bent back; the gods granted that they should be able
<div n="lb">to eat everything and utter indistinct cries. {%Agni%} was
<div n="lb">then revealed by a parrot, and cursed the parrots, saying that
<div n="lb">they should be deprived of the power of speech; the gods
<div n="lb">granted them to speak the letter k, and made {%śamī-%}wood a
<div n="lb">sacred resting-place of fire. The waters in the nethermost
<div n="lb">regions had come into contact with {%Agni,%} and those heated
<div n="lb">waters are vomited forth by the mountain springs. The gods
<div n="lb">asked {%Agni%} to rescue D., {%Prajāpatis,%} and Ṛ. from {%Tāraka%} by
<div n="lb">begetting a heroic son. {%Agni%} united himself spiritually
<div n="lb">with {%Gaṅgā;%} an {%Asura%} uttered a frightful roar; {%Gaṅgā%}
<div n="lb">became agitated and unable to bear the seed, and threw it off
<div n="lb">on {%Meru;%} the fœtus had the complexion of gold, etc.;
<div n="lb">therefore Ṛ. and D. called {%Agni%} by the name of {%Hiraṇyaretas%}
<div n="lb">(“having gold for his vital seed”), and the earth {%Vasumatī%}
<div n="lb">(“endued with wealth”). That fœtus, having fallen in a
<div n="lb">thicket of reeds, assumed a wonderful form; the {%Kṛttikāḥ%}
<div n="lb">reared it as their son, whence it came to be called {%Kārttikeya;%}
<div n="lb">he was also called {%Skanda%} and {%Guha%} (etymology). It was in
<div n="lb">this way that gold came into existence as the offspring of
<div n="lb">{%Agni (Jātavedas),%} and hence gold was called {%jātarūpa;%}
<div n="lb">gold is truly the illustrious {%Agni,%} the lord of all things, and
<div n="lb">the foremost of all {%Prajāpatis;%} the most sacred of all sacred
<div n="lb">things is gold; it has for its essence {%Agni%} and {%Soma.%}—
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha%} continued: This tale {%(Brahmadarśana)%} was also
<div n="lb">heard by me in days of yore about {%Brahmán Paramātman%}
<div n="lb">(“the Supreme Soul”): In days of yore ({%lokādau,%} v. 4163),
<div n="lb">{%Rudra,%} who is {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), having assumed the form of
<div n="lb">{%Varuṇa%} (cf. v. 4133, {%Varuṇaḥ Pāvanātmakaḥ%}), performed a
<div n="lb">sacrifice, to which came the {%munis%} and all the deities with
<div n="lb">{%Agni,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).; {%Śiva%} (i.e. {%Rudra%}) then himself poured libations
<div n="lb">into his own self. At the sight of the celestial damsels the seed
<div n="lb">(endued with {%sattva, rajas,%} and {%tamas%}) of {%Brahmán%} fell upon
<div n="lb">the Earth; {%Pūṣan%} took it up, and it was taken with the
<div n="lb">sacrificial ladle and poured as an oblation into the fire;
<div n="lb">thence {%Brahmán%} caused the orders of beings to spring into
<div n="lb">existence; further {%Bhṛgu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); for this reason {%Agni%} is said
<div n="lb">to be all the deities. {%Bhṛgu%} was reckoned the offspring of
<div n="lb">{%Varuṇa, Aṅgiras%} that of {%Agni, Kavi%} that of {%Brahmán; Bhṛgu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgiras,%} and {%Kavi%} were all of them {%prajānāṃ patayaḥ;%} their
[Page668-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">offspring (v. 4144—4152) ({%Bhṛgu's:%} <lang n="greek"></lang>; {%Aṅgiras':%} <lang n="greek"></lang>; {%Kavi's:%} <lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">are called {%Vāruṇāḥ,%} and {%Kavi%} and {%Bhṛgu Vāruṇau. Agni%} is
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán, Paśupati,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); gold is the offspring of {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">(v. 4146); when fire is not obtainable gold is used as a
<div n="lb">substitute, oh {%Jāmadagnya!%} (B. and C. wrongly read {%Jāma-%}
<div n="lb">{%dagnyaḥ,%} which PCR. translates “one that knows the identity
<div n="lb">of gold with fire”) by one who is conversant with the vedic
<div n="lb">authorities (v. 4165), etc. (v. 4166—7); {%Agni%} sprang from
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} and from {%Agni%} sprang gold (v. 4168); those
<div n="lb">persons observant of righteousness who make gifts of gold are
<div n="lb">regarded as giving away all the deities (v. 4169), etc.; he
<div n="lb">who makes a gift of gold at the second twilight succeeds in
<div n="lb">attaining to residence with {%(sālokyaṃ) Brahmán, Vāyu, Agni,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Soma%} (v. 4173), and to the regions of {%Indra%} (v. 4174),
<div n="lb">etc.; he has never to fall down from the regions to which he
<div n="lb">attains (v. 4176). After a long time {%Kārttikeya%} grew up,
<div n="lb">and was chosen as generalissimo by all the gods with {%Indra;%}
<div n="lb">he slew Dai. {%Tāraka%} and many other {%Asuras. Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">continued: “Thus addressed by {%Vasiṣṭha%} [Rāma] {%Jāma-%}
<div n="lb">{%dagnya%} made gifts of gold to the brahmans and became
<div n="lb">cleansed of his sins” (XIII, {@85@}). [For continuation v.
<div n="lb">{%Tārakavadhopākhyāna%} (§ 748).]
