{@Brāhmaṇa-māhātmya-kathana.@}¦ § 454 (Mārk.):
<div n="lb">Questioned by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} about the greatness of the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans, Mārkaṇḍeya%} told: A prince of the {%Haihayas%} killed
<div n="lb">a {%brahman,%} whom he took for a deer, as he was enveloped in
<div n="lb">the skin of a black antelope. The {%Haihayas,%} very afflicted,
<div n="lb">set out inquiring as to whose son the {%muni%} might be.
<div n="lb">Arriving at the hermitage of {%Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi,%} they told
<div n="lb">him the matter, and learnt that it was his son, and that he
<div n="lb">had been revived, because these {%munis%} had no fear of death,
<div n="lb">as they spoke well of {%brahmans,%} etc. (III, {@184@}).—§ 455:
<div n="lb">{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} continued: When the {%rājarṣi Vainya%} was per-
<div n="lb">forming the horse-sacrifice, {%Atri%} desired to go and ask him for
<div n="lb">alms, but gave up his desire of wealth and proposed to his
<div n="lb">wife and sons that they should all retire to the woods. His
<div n="lb">wife prevailed upon him that (though he had heard from
<div n="lb">{%Gautama%} that there were {%brahmans%} about {%Vainya%} who were
<div n="lb">jealous of him) he should first acquire riches and distribute
<div n="lb">them to his sons and servants, and so he went to {%Vainya%} and
<div n="lb">praised him as the foremost of sovereigns and the ruler of
<div n="lb">their destinies {%(vidhātṛ).%} The {%ṛṣi Gautama%} blamed him for
<div n="lb">thus flattering the king, and said that it was {%Indra%} who was
<div n="lb">the foremost of sovereigns and ruler of their destinies
<div n="lb">{%(vidhātṛ).%} The {%munis%} (having let the pious {%Kāśyapa%} inquire
<div n="lb">about the matter) applied to {%Sanatkumāra,%} who said that the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} and {%kṣattriyas%} ought to act together, and that the
<div n="lb">king (enumeration of honourable appellations) might rightly
<div n="lb">be styled as {%Atri%} had done. {%Vainya%} then gave to {%Atri%} 1000
<div n="lb">maidservants and 100 millions of gold [coins] and ten {%bhāras%}
<div n="lb">of gold. Having given this to his sons {%Atri%} retired to the
<div n="lb">forest (III, {@185@}).
