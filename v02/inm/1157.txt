{@Balāka@}¦ (a hunter). § 608{%f%} (Karṇap.) VIII, {@69,@} 3438,
<div n="lb">3440, 3441, 3447: The hunter {%Balāka%} used to slay animals
<div n="lb">for the livelihood of his sons and wives, and thus he also
<div n="lb">supported his parents and others that depended upon him
<div n="lb">always speaking the truth and never harbouring malice.
<div n="lb">devoted to the duties of his own order. One day, having
<div n="lb">found no other animal, he slew a blind {%(ghrāṇacakṣuṣaṃ)%}
<div n="lb">beast of prey while it was drinking water. A shower of
<div n="lb">flowers fell from the skies; a celestial chariot took him to
<div n="lb">heaven, while Aps., etc., were singing. That beast of prey
<div n="lb">had by austerities obtained a boon, and had become the cause
<div n="lb">of the destruction of all creatures. For this reason he was
<div n="lb">made blind by {%Brahman.%}
