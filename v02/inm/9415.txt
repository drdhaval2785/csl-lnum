[{@Saṃvar(t)ta-Maruttīya@}]¦ (“the tale of Saṃvartta
<div n="lb">and Marutta”): § 778{%b%} (Aśvamedh.).** {%Vyāsa%} said: In the
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta%} age {%Manu%} was the ruler; > {%Prasandhi > Kṣupa%}
<div n="lb">{%> Ikṣvāku > Viṃśa%} (the model bowman, the eldest of 100
<div n="lb">brothers, all kings) {%> Viviṃśa > Khanīnetra (c) > Suvarcas (d)%}
<div n="lb">{%Karandhama > Avikṣit (e) Kārandhama > Marutta%} (who sur-
<div n="lb">passed his father, had the strength of 10,000 elephants, and
<div n="lb">was equal to {%Viṣṇu%}). Desirous of performing a sacrifice,
<div n="lb">{%Marutta,%} coming to {%Meru,%} on the northern side of {%Himavat,%}
<div n="lb">caused thousands of gold vessels to be forged; there on a huge
<div n="lb">golden hill he performed the rites along with other princes
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@4@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} said: As the
<div n="lb">offspring of {%Prajāpati Dakṣa,%} D. and As., challenged each
<div n="lb">other, so did {%Aṅgiras'%} sons {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Saṃvarta;%} troubled
<div n="lb">by his elder brother {%Saṃvarta%} went naked to the woods.
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} having vanquished the As., appointed Bṛh. as his
<div n="lb">priest. Formerly (read {%pūrvaṃ%} with B.) {%Aṅgiras%} was the
<div n="lb">family priest of king {%Karandhama%} (see {%d%}); so also of his son
<div n="lb">{%Avikṣit%} (equal to {%Yayāti%}). His son {%Marutta%} used to defy
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} and {%Indra%} used to defy {%Marutta,%} but could not prevail
<div n="lb">over him. Then {%Indra%} took the promise from Bṛh. that he
<div n="lb">would not perform priestly offices for {%Marutta%} (“thou hast
<div n="lb">destroyed {%Namuci, Viśvarūpa,%} and {%Bala,%}” said Bṛh.).
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Then {%Indra%} was cured for his envy
<div n="lb">and went home (XIV, {@5@}). {%Vyāsa%} said: The ancient tale
<div n="lb">of the discourse between Bṛh. and {%Marutta%} is cited in this
<div n="lb">connection. {%Marutta%} in vain tried to persuade Bṛh. to
<div n="lb">officiate at his sacrifice (which Bṛh. had himself formerly
<div n="lb">proposed); D. ṛ. (M.-ṛ.) {%Nārada%} told him to apply to {%Saṃvarta,%}
<div n="lb">who now, desirous of seeing {%Maheśvara,%} wandered about in
<div n="lb">{%Vārāṇasī%} in the garb of a madman; “having reached the
<div n="lb">gate of that city, thou must place a dead body somewhere
<div n="lb">near it, and the man who shall turn away on seeing the
<div n="lb">corpse, do thou know that man to be {%Saṃvarta;%} if he should
<div n="lb">ask thee to follow me,” said {%Nārada,%} “thou mayst even tell
<div n="lb">him without hesitation that I have ascended the pyre.”
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} said: “By acting thus, {%Marutta%} found {%Saṃvarta%}
<div n="lb">in a lonely place; {%Saṃvarta%} covered him with mud and
<div n="lb">ashes and phlegm and spittle. At last he sat down under
<div n="lb">a {%nyagrodha%} tree” (XIV, {@6@}). {%Marutta%} told him the matter
<div n="lb">(also that {%Nārada%} had mounted the pyre); {%Saṃvarta%} then,
<div n="lb">as a lunatic, scolding {%Marutta%} repeatedly with harsh words,
<div n="lb">told him to go to Bṛh. first (as his elder brother), and taking
<div n="lb">Bṛh.'s permission he might come back. As {%Marutta%} said
<div n="lb">that he had already been repulsed by Bṛh., and that he now
<div n="lb">desired to sacrifice even with all his goods in order to outstrip
<div n="lb">{%Indra, Saṃvarta%} consented, if {%Marutta%} would agree to do all
<div n="lb">that {%Saṃvarta%} would ask him to do, as Bṛh. and {%Indra%} were
<div n="lb">certain to do all they could to injure {%Marutta. Marutta%} took
<div n="lb">an oath to this. {%Saṃvarta%} said that {%Marutta%} would surpass
[Page614-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} D., and G.; he himself had no desire for wealth, but
<div n="lb">would only do what was disagreeable to {%Indra%} and Bṛh.
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@7@}). {%Saṃvarta%} said: There is a peak {%Muñjavat (f)%} on
<div n="lb">the {%Himālaya,%} where {%Śiva%} is constantly engaged in austerities;
<div n="lb">go thither and appease {%Śiva,%} whose names are {%Śarva,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">then thou shalt acquire that gold. {%Marutta%} acted accordingly;
<div n="lb">Bṛh. became sick from envy; {%Indra%} with D. came (XIV, {@8@})
<div n="lb">and was told about the matter (“prosperity of a rival is always
<div n="lb">painful, and for this reason thou with D. persecutest As. and
<div n="lb">kills them”). He despatched {%Agni (g)%} to {%Marutta,%} asking
<div n="lb">him to let Bṛh. officiate as his priest instead of {%Saṃvarta,%}
<div n="lb">promising him the greatest rewards (“such as the highest
<div n="lb">regions created by {%Prajāpati%} and even the whole kingdom of
<div n="lb">the gods”); {%Saṃvarta%} threatened to burn {%Agni%} with his
<div n="lb">fearful eye, if he ever came again on such an errand. {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">was frightened and returned to {%Indra%} and Bṛh. and said that
<div n="lb">{%Marutta%} had refused and did not care for his promises. {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Agni%} to return to {%Marutta,%} and threatened him with
<div n="lb">{%Indra's%} thunderbolt if he did not obey; {%Agni,%} afraid of
<div n="lb">{%Saṃvarta,%} suggested that the G. king should go; {%Indra%} said
<div n="lb">that nobody could burn {%Agni; Agni%} asked why then {%Vṛtra%}
<div n="lb">could deprive {%Indra%} of the sovereignty of Heaven; {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">mentioning his victories over the {%Kālakeyas,%} Dā., and
<div n="lb">{%Prahlāda,%} said that it was because he did not accept {%soma%}
<div n="lb">from a foe, nor strike the weak with his thunderbolt; {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">reminded him of {%Cyavana%} at {%Śaryāti's%} sacrifice and the
<div n="lb">creation of {%Mada%} (description): “the might of brahmans
<div n="lb">is greater than that of kṣatriyas” (XIV, {@9@}). Then {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">sent G. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} on the same errand, but in vain. {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">said: As the clouds indicated that {%Indra%} must be near,
<div n="lb">{%Marutta%} repaired to {%Saṃvarta,%} who comforted him, saying that
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} would protect him, and that he would himself dispel
<div n="lb">the thunder by the winds, and granted him the boon that {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">should come in person to his sacrifice and accept the oblations
<div n="lb">offered to him, and so should all the gods. And so it
<div n="lb">happened by the power of {%Saṃvarta's%} incantations. Re-
<div n="lb">quested by {%Saṃvarta, Indra%} himself gave directions to all the
<div n="lb">gods to erect a hall of assembly: 1,000 well-furnished
<div n="lb">rooms with a durable staircase for the ascent of G. and Aps.,
<div n="lb">and to furnish that portion of the sacrificial ground reserved
<div n="lb">for the dance of Aps., like unto the palace of {%Indra%} in
<div n="lb">heaven; {%Indra%} said that {%Marutta's%} ancestors and the gods
<div n="lb">had been highly pleased, and told him to offer a red bull to
<div n="lb">{%Agni,%} and a blue bull with a variegated skin to V.-D.
<div n="lb">Then {%Indra%} and the gods returned home. {%Marutta%} placed
<div n="lb">heaps of gold on various spots and distributed immense
<div n="lb">wealth to the brahmans.
