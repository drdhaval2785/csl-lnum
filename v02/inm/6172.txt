[{@Kuṇḍalāharaṇaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">taking away of the ear-rings”)], the fiftieth of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mhbhr.—§ 546: Asked by Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana
<div n="lb">related how Indra removed Yudhiṣṭhira's fear of Karṇa, as
<div n="lb">he had promised to Yudhiṣṭhira through Lomaśa: In the
<div n="lb">thirteenth year of the exile of the Pāṇḍavas, Indra resolved,
<div n="lb">in the guise of a brahman, to ask Karṇa for his ear-rings
<div n="lb">(sprung from amṛta) and mail for the benefit of Arjuna.
[Page435-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">Sūrya then came to Karṇa in a dream and dissuaded him
<div n="lb">from giving them. “There is beside some mystery which
<div n="lb">you will understand in time.” Karṇa refused to break his
<div n="lb">vow always to give to brahmans and confided in the weapons
<div n="lb">which he had obtained from Rāma Jāmadagnya and Droṇa.
<div n="lb">Sūrya then prevailed upon him to beseech Indra to give him
<div n="lb">a dart (III, {@300—2@}).—§ 547: Karṇa (q.v.).
