<div n="lb">lating to the slaughter of the Saṃśaptakas,” the 72nd of the
<div n="lb">minor parvans of the Mhbhr.; cf. Saṃśaptakavadha). § 591:
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} confessed his inability to seize {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">were by. The {%Trigarta%} king said that {%Arjuna%} had always
<div n="lb">injured them, and took an oath that either {%Arjuna%} or the
<div n="lb">{%Trigartas%} should be slain. This oath was taken by the five
<div n="lb">brothers {%Satyaratha,%} etc., (<lang n="greek"></lang>) with their 10,000 chariots, and by
<div n="lb">the {%Mālava%} king, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Then they summoned {%Arjuna%} towards
<div n="lb">the southern part of the field. {%Arjuna%} told {%Satyajit%} to guard
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and went out against the {%Trigartas%} (VII, {@17@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 592: THE TWELFTH DAY'S BATTLE. The {%Saṃśaptakas%} rejoiced
<div n="lb">at the prospect of fighting {%Arjuna,%} who addressed Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">about this ill-timed joy, and terrified them with the sound of
<div n="lb">{%Devadatta,%} and attacked them. {%Subāhu & Arjuna; Suśarman,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) & {%Arjuna;%} they fled to {%Duryodhana;%} but urged by
<div n="lb">the {%Trigarta%} king, they once more returned to the field with
<div n="lb">the {%Nārāyaṇa%} cowherds (VII, {@18@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} conveyed
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} to the {%Saṃśaptakas.%} The {%Nārāyaṇas & Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">{%(+ Kṛṣṇa); Arjuna%} blew {%Devadatta%} and employed the
<div n="lb">{%Tvāṣṭra%} weapon, that confounded the foes, who began to
<div n="lb">fight each other; {%Arjuna%} crushed the {%Lalitthas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and
<div n="lb">with the {%Vāyavya%} weapon he dispersed the arrows shot by
<div n="lb">his foes, and {%Vāyu%} blew away crowds of {%Saṃśaptakas%} with
<div n="lb">their steeds, etc. Meanwhile {%Droṇa%} attacked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">(VII, {@19@}). {%Droṇa%} had arrayed his troops in the shape
<div n="lb">of a {%garuḍa: Droṇa%} in the mouth; {%Duryodhana%} and his
<div n="lb">brothers = the head; {%Kṛtararman%} and {%Kṛpa%} = the two eyes;
<div n="lb">{%Bhūtaśarman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in its neck; {%Bhūriśravas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in
<div n="lb">the right wing; {%Vinda,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the left wing before

<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} with his sons, etc.; {%Jayadratha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the bosom;
<div n="lb">in the midst the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} disposed
<div n="lb">his troops in the shape of a semicircle. {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna &%}
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa + Duṛmukha Dhārtarāṣṭra; Droṇa%} dispersed {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira's%} host (VII, {@20@}). {%Droṇa & Yudhiṣṭhira + Satyajit +%}
<div n="lb">{%Vṛka; Satyajit%} was slain by {%Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira%} fled. The
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Droṇa,%} and were consumed; {%Śatā-%}
<div n="lb">{%nīka%} (younger brother of the {%Matsya%} king) & {%Droṇa,%} who
<div n="lb">slew him; the {%Matsyas%} fled. {%Droṇa%} defeated the {%Cedis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa; Śikhaṇḍin,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), & {%Droṇa; Droṇa%}
<div n="lb">slew {%Kṣema. Yudhiṣṭhira%} fled away. {%Droṇa%} slew {%Pāñcālya%}
<div n="lb">({%Pāñcālyanāmnā,%} Nīl.). {%Droṇa%} crushed the {%Pāñcālas,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and, supported by the {%Kurus,%} he vanquished
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} fled away in all directions
<div n="lb">(VII, {@21@}). {%Duryodhana%} addressed {%Karṇa%} in joy, beholding
<div n="lb">the {%Pāñcālas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), broken by {%Droṇa,%} and {%Bhīmasena%}
<div n="lb">abandoned by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Sṛñjayas. Karṇa%} said
<div n="lb">that {%Bhīmasena,%} followed by {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would never
<div n="lb">leave the fight; {%Duryodhana%} proceeded to {%Droṇa's%} chariot,
[Page612-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">where a deafening noise was heard of {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors
<div n="lb">returning to the fight (VII, {@22@}). At the request of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} described the steeds of {%Bhīmasena,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), especially mentioning {%Bṛhanta (b);%} the standards of
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the bows of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VII,
<div n="lb">{@23@}). The despondency of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} mentioning {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VII, {@24@}). When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} returned to fight
<div n="lb">and attacked {%Droṇa,%} the {%Kurus%} were afraid. {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">urged his troops against them. {%Durmarṣaṇa Dhārtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">{%& Bhīma; Kṛtavarman & Yuyudhāna;%} the {%Sindhu%} king &

<div n="lb">{%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda & Virāṭa;%} that encounter between the

<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena;%} the {%Aṅga%} king (Mleccha king) & do.; {%Bhīma%} slew
<div n="lb">him, and his divisions fied; the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king (upon his
<div n="lb">elephant {%Supratīka%}) & {%Bhīma%} (who knew the {%añjalikāvedha%});
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} escaped from the elephant, but was supposed to have
<div n="lb">been slain; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (+ the {%Pāñcālas%}) & {%Bhagadatta%}
<div n="lb">(upon {%Supratīka%}); the {%Daśārṇa%} king (upon his elephant) &
<div n="lb">{%Bhagadatta; Bhagadatta & Yuyudhāna; Bhagadatta%} destroyed
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops; {%Bhīma & Bhagadatta,%} whose elephant

<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) & {%Bhagadatta;%} the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops fled
<div n="lb">(VII, {@26@}). Urged by {%Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa%} began to proceed
<div n="lb">against {%Bhagadatta;%} the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (10,000 {%Trigartas%} and
<div n="lb">4,000 {%Nārāyaṇāḥ (Vāsudevasyānugāḥ)%}) challenged {%Arjuna,%} and
<div n="lb">he encountered them, shot the {%Brāhma%} weapon, defeated and
<div n="lb">slew them, and then turned against {%Bhagadatta%} (VII, {@27@});
<div n="lb">but as {%Suśarman%} with his brothers followed him from behind,
<div n="lb">he again attacked {%Suśarman,%} and then again {%Bhagadatta%} (VII,
<div n="lb">{@28@}); {%Bhagadatta,%} at last, by means of {%mantras%} changed his
<div n="lb">hook into the {%Vaiṣṇava%} weapon, which, received by {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">on his breast, became a garland. As {%Arjuna%} taxed {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">for his taking part in the battle, {%Kṛṣṇa%} related the history
<div n="lb">of the {%Vaiṣṇavāstra (c).%} “The great {%Asura%} has now been
<div n="lb">divested of that supreme weapon; now slay {%Bhagadatta,%}
<div n="lb">that enemy of the gods, even as I formerly for the benefit

<div n="lb">both {%Bhagadatta%} (who was ever the favourite and friend
<div n="lb">of {%Indra,%} v. 1302), and the elephant (VII, {@29@}). Then
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} slew the two brothers {%Vṛṣa[ka]%} and {%Acala%} (sons of
<div n="lb">the {%Gāndhāra%} king {%Subala%}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons attacked
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} and {%Śakuni%} created illusions in order to confound
<div n="lb">him and {%Kṛṣṇa:%} clubs, etc., and asses, etc., which {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">slew with celestial weapons; then darkness, whence pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded harsh voices; this {%Arjuna%} dispelled with the weapon
[Page612-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Jyotiṣka;%} then waves of water, dried up with the {%Āditya%}
<div n="lb">weapon; {%Śakuni%} fled. {%Arjuna%} slaughtered the {%Kuru%} army:
<div n="lb">one stream proceeded towards {%Droṇa,%} one towards {%Duryodhana;%}
<div n="lb">a fierce battle took place on the southern side between
