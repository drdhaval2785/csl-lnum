[{@Gālavacarita(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the history of Gālava”; cf. Gālavasya
<div n="lb">caritaṃ). § 565 (Bhagavady.): In ancient times, in order to
<div n="lb">try {%Viśvāmitra,%} who was then engaged in ascetic austerities,
<div n="lb">{%Dharma%} in the form of the {%Ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha,%} and feigning him-
<div n="lb">self hungry, came to his hermitage. {%Viśvāmitra%} cooked {%caru,%}
<div n="lb">but could not approach {%Dharma%} before his guest had dined with
<div n="lb">the other hermits. {%Dharma%} said, “I have already dined;
<div n="lb">wait here,” and went away. {%Viśvāmitra,%} bearing that food
<div n="lb">on his head and himself subsisting on air, waited a hundred
<div n="lb">years, while the ascetic {%Gālava%} waited on him. Then {%Dharma%}
<div n="lb">accepted that food, which was still warm and fresh, and
<div n="lb">called {%Viśvāmitra%} a {%viprarṣi,%} whereby he became a {%brahman.%}
<div n="lb">{%Gālava%} repeatedly asked {%Viśvāmitra%} to take a gift from him
<div n="lb">as his preceptor, and at last {%Viśvāmitra,%} seeing his persistency,
<div n="lb">requested him to give 800 white steeds each with one black ear
<div n="lb">(V, {@106@}). {%Gālava%} got troubled and was gradually reduced
<div n="lb">to a skeleton. He thought of repairing to {%Viṣṇu%} (or {%Kṛṣṇa%}),
<div n="lb">when his friend {%Garuḍa%} came, and said he had spoken to
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu%} in his behalf, and that he would bear him (V, {@107@}).
<div n="lb">{%Garuḍa%} described the East: here {%Savitṛ%} first rises, and the
<div n="lb">{%tapas%} of the {%Sādhyas%} is performed at eve;…the two eyes
<div n="lb">of {%Dharma;%}…here the daughters of {%Dakṣa%} in primeval
<div n="lb">times gave birth to their children, and here the sons of
<div n="lb">{%Kaśyapa%} first multiplied; here {%Śakra%} was first anointed as
<div n="lb">king of the gods; here is the {%tapas%} of {%Indra%} and the gods,
<div n="lb">all their religious ceremonies; here the Creator {%(bhagavān%}
<div n="lb">{%Lokabhāvanaḥ)%} first sang the {%Vedas;%} here {%Sāvitrī%} was first
<div n="lb">said by {%Savitṛ%} to the reciters of the {%Vedas (brahmavādiṣu),%}
<div n="lb">and here the Yajurveda {%(yajūṃṣi)%} was given by {%Sūrya;%} here
<div n="lb">the {%Soma%} juice was first drunk by the gods, etc.; it was here
<div n="lb">that {%Varuṇa,%} repairing to {%Pātāla,%} obtained prosperity {%(śriyaṃ);%}
<div n="lb">here the birth, growth, and death of the ancient {%Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">took place; here first grew the hundred branches {%(sṛtayaḥ)%}
<div n="lb">of {%oṃ;%} here the {%Munis%} called {%dhūmapāḥ%} first imbibed the smoke
<div n="lb">of the {%havis;%} here the thousand-rayed Sun slays, rising, the
<div n="lb">wicked and ungrateful men and {%Asuras;%} here is the gate of
<div n="lb">the three worlds and the path to heaven and to felicity
<div n="lb">(V, {@108@}). {%Garuḍa%} menṭioned the remarkable subjects in the
<div n="lb">South ({%dakṣiṇā diś,%} so called because {%Vivasvat%} gave it away
<div n="lb">as a {%dakṣiṇā%}): {%Pitṛpakṣas trailokasya; Ūṣmapāḥ devāḥ;%}
<div n="lb">the {%Viśvedevas%} with the {%Pitṛs,%} with whom they equally
<div n="lb">share the sacrifices in all the worlds; the second door of
<div n="lb">{%Dharma…;%} the {%Devarṣis, Pitṛlokarṣis,%} and {%Rājarṣis,%} who
<div n="lb">dwell here in great happiness…; it is the region whither
<div n="lb">all must repair;…there are {%Nairṛtāḥ%} to be seen by the sinful;
<div n="lb">the {%Gandharvas%} chanting on {%Mandara%} and in the abodes of the
<div n="lb">{%viprarṣis; Raivata%} who, hearing the {%Sāmans,%} retired to the
<div n="lb">woods, leaving wife and friends and kingdom; {%Sāvarṇi%} and
<div n="lb">{%Yāvakrīta%} setting a limit to {%Sūrya%} (the southern tropical
<div n="lb">circle, PCR.); {%Rāvaṇa%} soliciting immortality from the gods;
<div n="lb">{%Vṛtra%} incurring the enmity of {%Śakra; Vaitaraṇī%} filled with
<div n="lb">the bodies of persons condemned to hell…; reaching this
[Page288-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">region the sun drops sweet water (i.e. the beginning of the
<div n="lb">rainy season, Nīl.), and thence, proceeding again to the
<div n="lb">{%Vāsiṣtha%} direction ({%Vāsiṣṭhīṃ kāṣṭhāṃ%} = the quarter of
<div n="lb">the seven Ṛṣis, i.e. the North, Nīl), once more drops
<div n="lb">dew {%(himaṃ);%} there is {%Garuḍa%} obtaining for food an
<div n="lb">enormous elephant and tortoise; the great {%Ṛṣi Cakradhanus%}
<div n="lb">birth from {%Sūrya%} took place here (he was afterwards known
<div n="lb">as {%Kapila%} who burned {%Sagara's%} sons); the perfect {%(siddhāḥ)%}
<div n="lb">brahmans, named {%Śivāḥ,%} who fully had mastered the {%Vedas,%}
<div n="lb">here obtained liberation {%(mokṣa);%} here is {%Bhogavatī,%} ruled
<div n="lb">by {%Vāsuki, Takṣaka,%} and {%Airāvata.%} Those that have to
<div n="lb">journey hither encounter here a thick gloom, so that it cannot
<div n="lb">be penetrated by either the Sun or by {%Agni;%} “even thou
<div n="lb">shalt have to pass this road” (V, {@109@}). {%Garuḍa%} mentioned
<div n="lb">the remarkable subjects and occurrences of the West: {%Varuṇa's%}
<div n="lb">origin; his instalment by {%Kaśyapa;%} the Moon, quaffing all
<div n="lb">the six juices of {%Varuṇa,%} becomes young again in the beginning
<div n="lb">of the bright fortnight; the {%Daityas%} being routed and bound
<div n="lb">fast by {%Vāyu;%} the mountain {%Asta;%} Night and Sleep; {%Śakra%}
<div n="lb">beholding the goddess {%(devīṃ) Diti%} asleep, and cutting off her
<div n="lb">fœtus, whence sprang the {%Maruts;%} the roots of {%Himavat%}
<div n="lb">stretching towards the eternal {%Mandara%} (sunk in the Ocean,
<div n="lb">Nīl.), the end of which is not to be reached by journeying for
<div n="lb">even 1,000 years; {%Surabhi%} milking on the shores of the lake
<div n="lb">with golden lotuses; in the midst of the Ocean the headless
<div n="lb">trunk of {%Svarbhānu;%} the chanting of the {%Vedas%} by {%Suvarṇa-%}
<div n="lb">{%śiras%} (invisible, and whose hair is eternally yellow); {%Dhvajavatī,%}
<div n="lb">the daughter of the {%muni Harimedhas,%} remaining in the air in
<div n="lb">consequence of {%Sūrya's%} injunction, ‘stay’;…the sources
<div n="lb">of the rivers; here, in the abode of {%Varuṇa,%} are the waters of
<div n="lb">the three worlds; the abode of {%Ananta,%} and of {%Viṣṇu,%} and
<div n="lb">of {%Pavana%} (the friend of {%Agni%}), and of the {%Maharṣi Kaśyapa%}
<div n="lb">{%Mārīca%} (V, {@110@}). The North {%(uttara)%} has its name from
<div n="lb">saving {%(uttāraṇa)%} from sin; it is also called {%madhyama,%} i.e.
<div n="lb">between the East and the West. None can live there that is
<div n="lb">unamiable, etc. {%Garuḍa%} mentioned its remarkable subjects
<div n="lb">and places: {%Badarī,%} the asylum of {%Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Jiṣṇu,%} and {%Brahmán; Maheśvara%} with the effulgence of
<div n="lb">the {%yugānta%} fire; {%Puruṣa%} dwelling with {%Prakṛti,%} invisible
<div n="lb">to {%munis,%} D. with I., G., Y., and Si., except {%Nara%} and
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa;%} there {%Viṣṇu%} appears alone, having 1,000 heads
<div n="lb">and 1,000 legs; there {%Candramas%} (the Moon) was installed
<div n="lb">in the sovereignty over the {%brahmans; Mahādeva%} receiving
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%} on his head; {%Devī%} practising austerities for obtaining
<div n="lb">{%Maheśvara; Kāma;%} the wrath (of {%Śiva,%} PCR.); here took
<div n="lb">place {%Kubera's%} instalment, on the breast of {%Kailāsa,%} in
<div n="lb">the sovereignty of Rā., Y., and G.; {%Caitraratha;%} here is
<div n="lb">the asylum of the {%Vaikhānasas; Mandākinī; Mandara;%}
<div n="lb">{%Saugandhikavana,%} guarded by {%Nairṛtas;%} the plantain forest
<div n="lb">{%(kadalī-skandhaṃ),%} etc.; the {%Siddhas;%} the seven {%Ṛṣis%} with
<div n="lb">{%Arundhatī; Svāti; Brahmán%} near {%Yajña…%} the {%munis%}
<div n="lb">named {%Dhāmā%} (? so B.) (whose origin, etc., are not known)
<div n="lb">guarding {%Gāyantikādvāra%} (B. {%Gaṅgāmahādvāraṃ%}); the man
<div n="lb">who passes beyond them will certainly meet with destruction,
<div n="lb">except {%Nārāyaṇa%} and {%Nara%} or {%Jiṣṇu;%} here is {%Kailāsa,%} the
<div n="lb">abode of {%Ailavila;%} the origin of the ten {%Apsarases Vidyut-%}
<div n="lb">{%prabhāḥ; Viṣṇupada,%} made by {%Viṣṇu,%} when he, in his covering
<div n="lb">the worlds with three steps, stepped on the northern region;
<div n="lb">here took place king {%Marutta's%} sacrifice at {%Uśīrabīja,%} by the
<div n="lb">side of the golden lake; here was {%Himavat's%} gold-mine, that
<div n="lb">exhibited itself to the {%viprarṣi Jīmūta,%} who gave away the
<div n="lb">whole wealth to the brahmans, and had it called after his
<div n="lb">name {%(Jaimūta);%} here morning and evening the {%Lokapālas%}
[Page289-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">({%diśāṃ pālaṇ%} proclaim “what business of what person shall
<div n="lb">we do?’ it is called {%uttara%} (North) because it is superior
<div n="lb">{%(uttara)%} to all (V. {@111@}). At the request of {%Gālava, Garuḍa%}
<div n="lb">carried him (description) to the East, and laughed at his
<div n="lb">foolish thoughts of casting away his life. At the mountain
<div n="lb">{%Ṛṣabha%} they rested for some time (V, {@112@}). On the peak
<div n="lb">of the {%Ṛṣabha%} they met with a brahman lady, {%Śāṇḍilī,%}
<div n="lb">engaged in penances; she gave them cooked food; they fell
<div n="lb">asleep. As {%Garuḍa%} awoke, his wings had fallen off. It was
<div n="lb">because he had, out of pity, thought of carrying the lady to
<div n="lb">the place where {%Mahādeva, Viṣṇu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), live together.
<div n="lb">She gave him his wings back, having warned him not to
<div n="lb">contemn women, and they set out, but failed to find the
<div n="lb">steeds. {%Viśvāmitra%} met them, and said the time had already
<div n="lb">passed, but promised to wait for some time more (V, {@113@}).
<div n="lb">{%Garuḍa%} explained the etymology of {%hiraṇya%} (gold) and {%dhana%}
<div n="lb">(wealth), and why gold is not easily obtainable (see the
<div n="lb">note of PCR. from Nīl.); it is guarded by the {%Ajaikapād-%}
<div n="lb">{%Ahirbradhnāḥ%} and by {%Dhanada%} (i.e. {%Kubera%}). They went to
<div n="lb">{%Garuḍa's%} friend, the {%Rājarṣi Yayāti Nāhuṣa%} (of the Lunar
<div n="lb">race), in {%Pratiṣṭhāna,%} and told him the matter, and that
<div n="lb">{%Gālava,%} when he had paid off his debt, would devote
<div n="lb">himself to severe ascetic penances and give {%Yayāti%} a portion
<div n="lb">of his wealth of asceticism; “as many hairs as there are
<div n="lb">in a horse's body, so many regions of bliss are attained
<div n="lb">by him that gives away a horse” (V, {@114@}). {%Yayāti,%} the
<div n="lb">performer of 1000 sacrifices, the liberal ruler of all the
<div n="lb">{%Kāśis,%} in view of the fact that they had come to him,
<div n="lb">passing over all the kings of the Solar race, not having the
<div n="lb">steeds, gave to {%Gālava%} his daughter {%Mādhavī,%} always solicited
<div n="lb">by gods, men, and {%Asuras. Garuḍa%} went away to his own
<div n="lb">abode, and {%Gālava%} offered {%Mādhavī%} to king {%Haryaśva%} of
<div n="lb">{%Ikṣvāku's%} race at {%Ayodhyā,%} who was desirous of offspring
<div n="lb">(V, {@115@}), on the condition that he gave as her dower the
<div n="lb">800 steeds of the kind wanted. {%Haryaśva%} had but 200 steeds
<div n="lb">of this kind; he therefore got the maiden—who by a brahman
<div n="lb">had been granted the boon that after each delivery she would
<div n="lb">be a maiden again—in order to beget only one son upon her,
<div n="lb">for his 200 steeds. This son was {%Vasumanas.%} Then {%Gālava%}
<div n="lb">offered her to king {%Divodāsa%} (V, {@116@}), the {%Kāśi%} king, son
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīmasena.%} The same arrangement was made as with
<div n="lb">{%Haryaśva.%} She bore him {%Pratardana%} (V, {@117@}). Then {%Gālava%}
<div n="lb">came to king {%Uśīnara%} in the city of the {%Bhojas,%} with whom
<div n="lb">the same arrangement was made. To him she bore {%Śibi%}
<div n="lb">Then {%Gālava%} took the maiden and went to see {%Garuḍa%}
<div n="lb">(V, {@118@}). {%Garuḍa%} said that the remaining 200 steeds were
<div n="lb">unobtainable. For in days of yore {%Ṛcīka%} sought at {%Kānya-%}
<div n="lb">{%kubja Gādhi's%} daughter {%Satyavatī%} in marriage, and was
<div n="lb">requested by {%Gādhi%} to give 1000 steeds of this kind.
<div n="lb">{%Ṛcīka%} obtained them at {%Aśvatīrtha,%} and gave them to the
<div n="lb">king. Performing the sacrifice {%Puṇḍarīka,%} the king gave
<div n="lb">them away to the {%brahmans.%} The three kings had each
<div n="lb">purchased 200 of them from the {%brahmans,%} but the remaining
<div n="lb">400, while being transported over the {%Vitastā,%} were taken by
<div n="lb">the river (so B.). {%Viśvāmitra,%} instead of obtaining the 200
<div n="lb">steeds wanting, begot {%Aṣṭaka%} upon {%Mādhavī,%} and gave him the
<div n="lb">steeds; {%Aṣṭaka%} then went to a certain city {%(puraṃ prāyāt%}
<div n="lb">{%tadā Somapuraprabhaṃ)%} and {%Kauśika%} (i.e. {%Viśvāmitra%}) to the
<div n="lb">woods. {%Gālava%} dismissed {%Garuḍa,%} and returning the maiden
<div n="lb">to her father, he went into the woods (V, {@119@}). {%Yayāti%} went
<div n="lb">to a hermitage on the confluence of the {%Gangā%} and {%Yamunā,%}
<div n="lb">taking {%Mādhavī, Pūru,%} and {%Yadu%} with him, desirous of again
<div n="lb">disposing of his daughter in a {%svayaṃvara.%} There was
[Page289-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">assembled a vast concourse of N., Y., G., men, etc., and
<div n="lb">numerous {%Ṛṣis%} resembling {%Brahmán%} himself. {%Mādhavī%}
<div n="lb">selected the forest as her lord, practised {%tapas,%} and adopted
<div n="lb">a deer's mode of life {%(mṛgacāriṇī).%} King {%Yayāti%} died after
<div n="lb">having lived for many thousands of years. The progeny
<div n="lb">of {%Pūru%} and {%Yadu%} multiplied greatly. {%Yayāti,%} resembling
<div n="lb">a {%maharṣi,%} enjoyed the highest bliss in heaven for many
<div n="lb">thousands of years. On one occasion, while seated among
<div n="lb">the {%Rājarṣis%} and {%Maharṣis,%} king {%Yayāti%} mentally disregarded
<div n="lb">all the gods and {%Ṛṣis%} and men. {%Indra%} at once read his heart;
<div n="lb">the dwellers of heaven did not longer know him, and he was
<div n="lb">soon divested of his splendour (V. {@120@}). For continuation
<div n="lb">v. Yayāti (§ 566).
