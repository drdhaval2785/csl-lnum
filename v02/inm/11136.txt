[{@Ulūkadūtāgamanaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section re-
<div n="lb">lating to Ulūka's arrival as an ambassador,” the 64th of the
<div n="lb">minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Ulūkadūtāgamana). § 571.
<div n="lb">When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had encamped on the bank of the
<div n="lb">{%Hiraṇvatī,%} the {%Kauravas%} also fixed their encampment. Then
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} consulted with {%Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and sent {%Ulūka%}
<div n="lb">to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Somakas%} in order to irritate them still
<div n="lb">more, with insulting messages to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (the story of
<div n="lb">the wicked cat), {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); before {%Arjuna%} he should
<div n="lb">mention the {%Kāmbojas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), among his troops; “I know
<div n="lb">that the {%Gāṇḍīva%} is full 6 cubits long” (V, {@160@}). {%Ulūka%}
<div n="lb">repeated the messages to the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (V, {@161@}), and
<div n="lb">repeated his words to {%Arjuna%} once more; {%Bhīmasena%} and the
<div n="lb">rest became furious; {%Kṛṣṇa%} counselled {%Ulūka%} to retire in
<div n="lb">time; {%Ulūka%} once more repeated his words; they became
<div n="lb">still more enraged, especially {%Bhīma,%} who said that he would
<div n="lb">certainly drink {%Duḥśāsana's%} blood; also {%Sahadeva,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">gave him answers for {%Duryodhana; Sahadeva%} would slay
<div n="lb">{%Ulūka%} before the eyes of {%Śakuni,%} and then {%Śakuni%} himself
<div n="lb">(V, {@162@}). {%Arjuna%} said that {%Duryodhana's%} contrivance of
<div n="lb">seeking cover behind {%Bhīṣma%} would be of no avail, as he
<div n="lb">would himself slay {%Bhīṣma;%} the same said {%Śikhaṇḍin%} (“I
<div n="lb">have been created by the Creator for the destruction of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%}”); {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} would slay {%Droṇa%} with all his
<div n="lb">followers and friends. {%Ulūka%} related it all to {%Duryodhana.%}
<div n="lb">Messengers instructed by {%Karṇa%} promulgated: “array to-
<div n="lb">morrow before sunrise” (V, {@163@}). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} began to
<div n="lb">select combatants in order to pit them against particular
<div n="lb">warriors of the hostile force (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@164@}).
