<div n="lb">2250.—§ 615{%k%} (do.): Formerly {%Rāma%} [Dāśarathi] lived in
<div n="lb">the forest of {%Daṇḍaka%} from desire of slaying Rākṣasas. In
<div n="lb">{%Janasthāna%} he cut off the head of a Rākṣasa, which coursing
<div n="lb">at will fell upon the thigh of the brahman {%M.%} (who wandered
<div n="lb">through the woods) and piercing it, it stuck to it and remained
<div n="lb">there. {%M.%} in vain visited all the other tīrthas and spoke to
<div n="lb">many ṛṣis; at last upon his having bathed in the tīrtha
<div n="lb">{%Auśanasa,%} the head of the Rākṣasa fell off and was lost in the
<div n="lb">waters. {%M.,%} with purified soul and all his sins washed away,
<div n="lb">returned to his hermitage; the ṛṣis on account of this event
<div n="lb">called the tīrtha by the name of {%Kapālamocana.%} The great
<div n="lb">ṛṣi {%M.,%} repairing once more to that tīrtha, drank its water
<div n="lb">and was crowned with great ascetic success: IX, {@39,@} 2257,
