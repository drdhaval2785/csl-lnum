{@Rāmopākhyāna@}<sup>2</sup>¦ (“the episode relating to Rāma
<div n="lb">Jāmadagnya”). § 638{%b%} (Rājadh.): {%Jahnu > Aja > Balākāśva%}
<div n="lb">{%> Kuśika,%} who performed penances in order to get a son;
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} became his son:
<div n="lb"><C n="1"/>{%Gādhi.%} <C n="2"/>{%Bhṛgu.%}
<div n="lb"><C n="1"/>(2) {%Viśvāmitra.%} <C n="2"/>(1) {%Satyavatī~Ṛcīka.%}
<div n="lb"><C n="1"/>{%Jamadagni.%}
<div n="lb"><C n="1"/>{%Paraśu-Rāma.%}
<div n="lb">{%Ṛcīka%} destined a certain portion of the sacrificial food
<div n="lb">(wherein had been placed the {%brahman%} energy) for {%Satyavatī,%}
<div n="lb">which would give her a son of great wisdom, the foremost
<div n="lb">of {%brahmans;%} and another (wherein had been placed the sum
<div n="lb">total of {%kṣatriya%} energy) for her mother, which would give
<div n="lb">her for a son an invincible {%kṣatriya.%} Then {%Ṛcīka%} proceeded
<div n="lb">to the woods to practise penances. King {%Gādhi,%} on a {%tīrtha-%}
<div n="lb">{%yātrā,%} arrived at {%Ṛcīka's%} retreat with his queen. There the
<div n="lb">mother of {%Satyavatī,%} from ignorance, exchanged the two
<div n="lb">portions of the food. {%Ṛcīka%} predicted that the son of
<div n="lb">{%Satyavatī%} would become a terrible {%kṣatriya,%} but asked by
<div n="lb">{%Satyavatī,%} he granted that not her son {%(Jamadagni)%} but her
[Page592-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">grandson {%(Paraśu-Rāma)%} would become such; her mother
<div n="lb">would give birth to a brahman {%(Viśvāmitra).%} Besides the
<div n="lb">other sciences, {%Rāma%} mastered the {%Dhanurveda;%} gratifying
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva%} on {%Gandhamādana,%} he asked him for weapons,
<div n="lb">especially the axe, which made him unrivalled on earth.
<div n="lb">Meanwhile the virtuous {%kṣatriya,%} the {%Haihaya%} king {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">{%Kārtavīrya,%} who had got 1,000 arms through the grace of
<div n="lb">{%Dattātreya,%} having subjugated the whole earth with its
<div n="lb">mountains and seven islands, became a powerful emperor,
<div n="lb">and gave away the earth to the {%brahmans%} at a horse-
<div n="lb">sacrifice. Once, solicited by {%Agni,%} he gave alms to that
<div n="lb">deity: springing from the points of his shafts, {%Agni%} burnt
<div n="lb">villages, etc., and also the retreat of {%Āpava%} (i.e. {%Vasiṣṭha,%}
<div n="lb">Nīl.), who cursed {%Arjuna,%} saying that {%Rāma%} should lop off
<div n="lb">his arms. {%Arjuna,%} always devoted to peace, always regardful
<div n="lb">of {%brahmans,%} etc., did not think of that curse. His sons,
<div n="lb">always haughty and cruel, seized and brought away the
<div n="lb">calf of {%Jamadagni's homa-%}cow, without the knowledge of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna; Rāma%} lopped off the arms of {%Arjuna%} and brought
<div n="lb">back the calf; the sons of {%Arjuna%} came and slew {%Jamadagni,%}
<div n="lb">in the absence of {%Rāma,%} who vowed to free the earth of
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriyas,%} and slaughtered all the sons and grandsons of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} and thousands of {%Haihayas,%} and annihilated all
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriyas,%} and then, filled with compassion, retired into the
<div n="lb">woods. After some thousands of years, the grandson of
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} and son of {%Raibhya, Parāvasu%} said to {%Rāma%} in
<div n="lb">public: “were not {%Pratardana,%} etc., who were assembled
<div n="lb">at a sacrifice at the time of {%Yayāti's%} fall, {%kṣatriyas%} by birth;
<div n="lb">thou art not true of thy vow; through fear of {%kṣatriya%} heroes
<div n="lb">thou hast betaken thyself to the mountains.” {%Rāma%} once
<div n="lb">more slew {%kṣatriyas%} by hundreds. Those {%kṣatriyas,%} how-
<div n="lb">ever, that he spared, counted by hundreds, multiplied and
<div n="lb">became mighty monarchs on earth. {%Rāma%} once more
<div n="lb">slaughtered them, not sparing the very children. Some
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriya%} ladies, however, succeeded in protecting their
<div n="lb">children. Having made the earth destitute of {%kṣatriyas%}
<div n="lb">twenty-one times, {%Rāma,%} at the completion of a horse-
<div n="lb">sacrifice, gave away the earth as a sacrificial present to
<div n="lb">{%Kaśyapa.%} In order to preserve the remnant of the {%kṣatriyas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kaśyapa%} told {%Rāma%} to repair to the shores of the southern
<div n="lb">ocean and not to reside within his dominion. The ocean
<div n="lb">suddenly created {%Śūrpāraka%} for {%Rāma. Kaśyapa%} gave the
<div n="lb">earth to the {%brahmans%} and then entered the great forest.
<div n="lb">Then {%śūdras%} and {%vaiśyas%} began to cohabit with the
<div n="lb">wives of {%brahmans;%} unprotected duly by {%kṣatriyas,%} the
<div n="lb">earth quickly sank, and was held by {%Kaśyapa%} on his lap
<div n="lb">{%(ūru),%} whence she was called {%Urvī.%} For protection's sake
<div n="lb">she asked {%Kaśyapa%} for a king, saying that she had concealed
<div n="lb">some {%Haihaya kṣatriyas%} among women; [further] {%Paurava%}
<div n="lb">(son of {%Vidūratha%}), brought up among bears in the {%Ṛkṣavat%}
<div n="lb">mountain; [further] a son of {%Saudāsa,%} protected through
<div n="lb">compassion by {%Parāśara,%} and named {%Sarvakarman%} (etymology);
<div n="lb">{%Śibi's%} son {%Gopati,%} brought up in the forest among kine;
<div n="lb">{%Pratardana's%} son {%Vatsa,%} brought up among calves in a cow-
<div n="lb">pen; {%Dadhivāhana's%} grandson and {%Diviratha's%} son, concealed
<div n="lb">on the banks of {%Gaṅgā%} by {%Gautama; Bṛhadratha,%} protected by
<div n="lb">apes ({%? golāṅgūlaiḥ,%} cf. BR.; PCR.: wolves) on {%Gṛdhrakūṭa;%}
<div n="lb">many {%kṣatriyas%} belonging to the race of {%Marutta%} have been
<div n="lb">brought up by the ocean; they are living among artisans and
<div n="lb">goldsmiths; “their fathers and grandfathers have been slain
<div n="lb">for my sake by {%Rāma;%} it is my duty to see that their funeral
<div n="lb">rites are duly performed.” {%Kaśyapa,%} seeking out those
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriyas,%} installed them duly as kings in days of yore.
[Page593-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Those {%kṣatriya%} races that are now extant are the progeny
<div n="lb">of those princes.
