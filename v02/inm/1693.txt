[{@Bisastainyopākhyāna@}]¦ (“the episode relating to the
<div n="lb">theft of the lotus-stalks”). § 750{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%}
[Page153-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">said: The seven Ṛ. {%Kaśyapa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and {%Arundhatī%}
<div n="lb">together had one single maidservant, {%Gaṇḍā,%} who was
<div n="lb">married to the {%śūdra Paśusakha.%} While they, in days of old,
<div n="lb">practised penances, preparing themselves for {%(upaśikṣanto)%}
<div n="lb">{%Brahmaloka%} by yoga meditation {%(samādhinā),%} there occurred
<div n="lb">a severe drought; {%Śibi's%} son {%Śaibya%} had in former times
<div n="lb">given away a son of his as the sacrificial present to
<div n="lb">the {%ṛtvijes;%} that prince now died of starvation; impelled
<div n="lb">by hunger, the {%Ṛṣis%} cooked his body in a vessel. King
<div n="lb">{%Śaibya Vṛṣādarbhi%} came and offered to give them kine,
<div n="lb">etc., but they refused it: that acceptance of gifts from a king
<div n="lb">was poison; they left the spot abandoning that flesh. The
<div n="lb">king sent his ministers with figs, some of which were filled
<div n="lb">with gold; but {%Atri,%} finding them heavy, refused to take
<div n="lb">them; and so did all of them (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and left the spot. Filled
<div n="lb">with wrath, {%Vṛṣādarbhi,%} after having observed penances,
<div n="lb">poured libations into the fire accompanied by {%mantras;%} from
<div n="lb">the fire a hag {%(kṛtyā)%} sprang forth, whom he called {%Yātudhānī;%}
<div n="lb">he ordered her to slay the {%Ṛṣis,%} etc., having ascertained
<div n="lb">their names. While Ṛ. roved within the forest, subsisting
<div n="lb">upon fruits and roots, they saw a well-nourished mendicant
<div n="lb">[called further below {%Śunaḥsakha%}] with a dog in good
<div n="lb">condition; {%Arundhatī%} pointed him out to them, and each of
<div n="lb">them explained the superior condition of this mendicant with
<div n="lb">reference to one of the points in which he was better situated
<div n="lb">than they(<lang n="greek"></lang>). The wandering mendicant approached them
<div n="lb">and touched their hand according to custom. One day they
<div n="lb">beheld a beautiful lake overgrown with lotuses, and desired
<div n="lb">to gather some lotus-stalks; urged by {%Vṛṣādarbhi, Yātu-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhānī,%} who guarded the lake, would know their names before
<div n="lb">they took the stalks; {%Atri%} knew that she stood there in
<div n="lb">order to slay them; but they all told their names with their
<div n="lb">etymological explanations (<lang n="greek"></lang>); at each explanation {%Yātudhānī%}
<div n="lb">declared that she did not understand it, [in some cases] “in
<div n="lb">consequence of the inflections which the roots had undergone”;
<div n="lb">{%Śunaḥsakha%} calls himself {%Śunaḥsakha-sakhi,%} and as {%Yātudhānī%}
<div n="lb">wishes to hear the name once more in order to understand
<div n="lb">it, he struck her head with his triple stick, at which she
<div n="lb">was consumed to ashes. Having gathered lotus-stalks, they
<div n="lb">once more plunged into the lake in order to offer oblations
<div n="lb">of water to the {%Pitṛs.%} As they came up, the stalks were
<div n="lb">nowhere to be seen. They took, each of them, oaths to
<div n="lb">their innocence(<lang n="greek"></lang>); but the oath of {%Śunaḥsakha%} was “no
<div n="lb">oath at all,” and he confessed that he had stolen the stalks
<div n="lb">from desire of testing them; he turned out to be {%Indra,%} who
<div n="lb">had come to test them, and told them the whole matter
<div n="lb">about {%Yātudhānī.%} They then ascended to heaven in the
<div n="lb">company of {%Indra%} himself* (XIII, {@93@}).
