[{@Brāhmaṇagītā@}]¦ (“the instruction given by the brahman”).
<div n="lb">§ 782{%b%} (Anugītāparvan): {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: A certain brahman's
<div n="lb">wife asked her husband (who was a complete master of every
<div n="lb">kind of knowledge and wisdom) to what region she should
<div n="lb">go, being dependent on him as her husband, who was harsh
<div n="lb">in his conduct towards her ({%kīnāśaṃ,%} i.e. {%karkaśaṃ niranu-%}
<div n="lb">{%krośaṃ,%} Nīl.). The brahman discourses on acts; on the seat
<div n="lb">of the soul, where {%Bráhman, Soma,%} and {%Agni,%} etc., dwell,
<div n="lb">and for whose sake {%Brahmán,%} etc., in {%Yoga,%} worship the
<div n="lb">indestructible, etc.; the life-breaths {%prāṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); in the
<div n="lb">midst of them is {%Agni Vaiśvānara,%} whose seven flames are
<div n="lb">the nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear, the mind,
<div n="lb">and the understanding {%(boddhavyaṃ),%} etc. (XIV, {@20@}). In
<div n="lb">this connection an ancient story is cited, viz. that of the
<div n="lb">institution of the ten {%hotṛs,%} i.e. the ear, the skin, the two eyes,
[Page163-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the tongue, the nose, the two feet, the two hands, the genital
<div n="lb">organ, the lower duct, and speech; sound, etc., are the ten
<div n="lb">libations; the points of the compass, wind, sun, moon, earth,
<div n="lb">fire, {%Viṣṇu, Indra, Prajāpati,%} and {%Mitra%} are the ten fires,
<div n="lb">etc. (XIV, {@21@}); in this connection an ancient story is cited,
<div n="lb">viz. that of the institution of the seven {%hotṛs,%} the nose, the eye,
<div n="lb">the tongue, the skin, the ear, the mind, and the understanding
<div n="lb">{%(buddhiḥ),%} not knowing the qualities of one another; the
<div n="lb">nose, etc., and the understanding never succeed in appre-
<div n="lb">hending doubt, it is the mind [alone] that apprehends it;
<div n="lb">the nose, etc., and the mind never succeed in apprehending
<div n="lb">determination; it is the understanding alone that apprehends
<div n="lb">it; in this connection this ancient narrative of a discourse
<div n="lb">between the senses and the mind is cited: as the nose does
<div n="lb">not smell, etc., without the mind, the mind thought itself to
<div n="lb">be the eternal and foremost one of all the elements; but the
<div n="lb">senses said that without them the mind would have no enjoy-
<div n="lb">ments at all, etc. (XIV, {@22@}); likewise the ancient story of
<div n="lb">the institution of the five {%hotṛs: Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Samāna,%} and {%Vyāna;%} the wind nursed by {%Prāṇa > Apāna >%}
<div n="lb">{%Vyāna > Udāna > Samāna;%} these asked {%Brahmán%} in days of
<div n="lb">yore as to which of them was the foremost; {%Brahmán%} said
<div n="lb">that he upon whose extinction all the life-breaths become
<div n="lb">extinct is the foremost; it turned out (as {%Brahmán%} said)
<div n="lb">that they are all foremost and not foremost, as they possess
<div n="lb">the attributes of one another (XIV, {@23@}); likewise the
<div n="lb">ancient story of the discourse between {%Nāraca%} and Ṛ.
<div n="lb">{%Devamata. Devamata%} said: Which part of a creature that
<div n="lb">takes birth comes first into existence, is it {%Prāṇa%} or {%Āpāna,%}
<div n="lb">etc.? {%Nārada%} seems to give the following explanation:
<div n="lb">{%kāma%} (desire) is (1—2) {%samāna%} and {%vyāna,%} which move trans-
<div n="lb">versely and alternately [from the man to the woman, and
<div n="lb">{%vice versa?%}] and have sprung from {%sattva;%} from {%kāma%} springs
<div n="lb">the vital seed [in the man] and the {%rajas%} or blood [in the
<div n="lb">woman]; from the union of these two springs (3) {%prāṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">from the seed being modified by {%prāṇa%} springs (4) {%apāna;%}
<div n="lb">these two move up and down and represent the two libations
<div n="lb">in the [mystical] fire; from the sexual intercourse of the loving
<div n="lb">pair springs {%harṣa%} (pleasure), which is (5) {%udāna%} = the fire
<div n="lb">between {%prāṇa%} and {%apāna%} = the fire between day and night
<div n="lb">= the fire between {%sat%} (the existent) and {%asat%} (the non-
<div n="lb">existent) = [the union between {%Samāna%} and (Nīl.)] {%Vyāna%}
<div n="lb">{%= Śānti%} (tranquillity) = eternal {%Bráhman%} (“as the brahmans
<div n="lb">know”); in fire the smoke is {%tamas%} (darkness), and the ashes
<div n="lb">{%rajas%} (passion). [Nīl. takes all the expressions figuratively
<div n="lb">in a philosophical sense; according to him the seed {%(śukra)%}
<div n="lb">is = {%adṛṣṭa,%} i.e. the {%karman%} of past lives, the blood {%(śoṇitaṃ)%}
<div n="lb">= attachment to the objects of sense, {%prāṇa = liṅgātman,%}
<div n="lb">{%apāna%} = death, etc.] (XIV, {@24@}); likewise the ancient story
<div n="lb">of the {%Cāturhotra,%} i.e. the sacrifice with four {%hotṛs;%} the
<div n="lb">instrument, the action, the agent, and emancipation; at the
<div n="lb">sacrifice of {%yoga%} the {%Prāṇa%} is the {%Stotra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); people
<div n="lb">knowing {%Nārāyaṇa%} recite some Ṛcs; to {%Nārāyaṇa%} animals
<div n="lb">(i.e. the senses, Nīl.) were offered in days of yore; and some
<div n="lb">{%Sāmans; Nārāyaṇa%} is the soul of all (XIV, {@25@}); †there
<div n="lb">is one ruler, residing in the heart, etc.; instructed by him the
<div n="lb">seven Ṛ.'s shine in the firmament; having lived with that
<div n="lb">instructor. {%Indra%} attained to the sovereignty of all the worlds.
<div n="lb">There is one enemy, residing in the heart; instructed by him
<div n="lb">all snakes are always hated (†v. 746—750). In this con-
<div n="lb">nection the old story of the instruction of the snakes, the gods
<div n="lb">(and As.), and Ṛ. by {%Prajāpati%} is cited; asked by them what
<div n="lb">is highly beneficial, he said {%om,%} i.e. {%Bráhman%} in one syllable;
[Page163-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">then they ran away in various directions from desire of self-
<div n="lb">instruction; first arose in the snakes the disposition of biting;
<div n="lb">in the As. the disposition for ostentatious pride; the gods
<div n="lb">betook themselves to gifts, and M.-ṛ. to self-restraint (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@26@}). The brahman compared the world to an impassable
<div n="lb">fastness {%(durgaṃ),%} and {%Bráhman%} to a great forest; asked by
<div n="lb">his wife, he described this forest copiously (XIV, {@27@}); “it
<div n="lb">is not I, but nature that smells scents, etc.” In this con-
<div n="lb">nection an ancient discourse between an {%adhvaryu%} and a {%yati%}
<div n="lb">is recited: Beholding an animal sprinkled with water at
<div n="lb">a sacrificial ceremony, a {%yati%} blamed the {%adhvaryu%} for that
<div n="lb">destruction of life. The {%Adhvaryu%} appealed to the {%Vedas,%}
<div n="lb">saying, “This goat will not be destroyed, but will be
<div n="lb">benefited; that part of it which is of earth will go to earth,”
<div n="lb">etc.; the {%yati%} said that if the sacrifice was to the benefit of the
<div n="lb">goat, then the goats ought to give their consent; “abstention
<div n="lb">from cruelty is alone worthy of approbation; one should be
<div n="lb">guided by perception”; the {%adhvaryu%} objected that by
<div n="lb">smelling what belongs to the earth, etc., one takes life, as
<div n="lb">all these entities have life; the {%yati%} distinguished between the
<div n="lb">indestructible and the destructible of the soul {%(ātmanaḥ);%} of
<div n="lb">these only the indestructible is really existent; to him who is
<div n="lb">freed from all existent objects there is no fear; the {%adhvaryu%}
<div n="lb">admires and praises him, and says that he has no fault by
<div n="lb">performing those rites according to the {%mantras;%} the {%yati%}
<div n="lb">remained silent; the {%adhvaryu%} proceeded with the sacrifice
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@28@}). Follows the ancient story about the 1,000-armed
<div n="lb">king {%Kārtavīryārjuna%} and the Ocean; v. {%Arjuna Kārtavīrya%}
<div n="lb">{%(c)%} and {%Paraśu-Rāma (d)%} (XIV, {@29@}) with {%Alarka (e)%} (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@30@}). The brahman said: There are three foes in the world
<div n="lb">(i.e. ninefold, on account of the three guṇas); exultation,
<div n="lb">satisfaction, and joy 〈 goodness; desire, wrath, and hatred 〈 
<div n="lb">passion; lassitude, sloth, and delusion 〈 darkness. Persons
<div n="lb">conversant with the ancient {%kalpas%} recite some verses which
<div n="lb">were sung in days of old by king {%Ambarīṣa,%} who had
<div n="lb">acquired a tranquil soul: “I have killed all foes, etc., but
<div n="lb">the greatest vice has not yet been destroyed by me…”
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@31@}). Then the old narrative of the discourse between
<div n="lb">a brahman and king {%Janaka(f)%} is cited (XIV, {@32—33@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by his wife as to how this knowledge may be acquired,
<div n="lb">the brahman said: Know that {%Brāhmaṇī%} (i.e. {%buddhi,%} Nīl.) is
<div n="lb">the [lower] {%araṇī,%} the preceptor the upper {%araṇī;%} penances
<div n="lb">and conversance with the scriptures turn the upper {%araṇī;%}
<div n="lb">knowledge is the fire produced. Asked by his wife about the
<div n="lb">symbol {%(liṅgaṃ)%} of {%Bráhman%} called {%kṣetrajña,%} the brahman
<div n="lb">answered that he is without symbols and qualities. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">said: Then the mind of that brahman's wife, upon the
<div n="lb">destruction of the {%kṣetrajña,%} became that which is beyond
<div n="lb">the {%kṣetrajñas,%} in consequence of the knowledge of {%kṣetra.%}
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Arjuna,%} where now that brahman and his wife
<div n="lb">were, {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: “My mind {%(manas)%} is the brahman, my
<div n="lb">understanding {%(buddhi)%} is the {%brāhmaṇī;%} he who has been
<div n="lb">called {%kṣetrajña%} is I myself” (XIV. {@34@}).
