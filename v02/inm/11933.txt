[{@Viśvāmitropākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Viśvāmitra”): § 721{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: King
<div n="lb">{%Ajamīḍha%} (of {%Bharata's%} race) > king {%Jahnu%} (who got {%Gaṅgā%}
<div n="lb">for his daughter) > {%Sindhudvīpa%} (virtuous) > R-ṛ {%Balākāśva%}
<div n="lb">{%> Vallabha > Kuśika > Gādhi,%} who, being childless and
<div n="lb">desiring to have a son, repaired to the forest, where the
<div n="lb">beautiful {%Satyavatī%} was born to him. {%Cyavana's%} son, {%Ṛcīka%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhārgava,%} asked for her hand; but as he was poor, {%Gādhi%}
<div n="lb">required of him as a dower 1,000 white horses having one
<div n="lb">black ear, which he obtained from {%Varuṇa%} (by thinking of
<div n="lb">them at {%Aśvatīrtha,%} on the bank of the {%Gaṅgā,%} not far from
<div n="lb">{%Kānyakubja%}). {%Ṛcīka%} granted her a boon, that she should
<div n="lb">have a son; she related this to her mother, who prevailed
<div n="lb">upon her to obtain a son also for her; having promised them
<div n="lb">both a son, he told the mother to embrace an {%aśvattha%} tree
<div n="lb">and {%Satyavatī%} an {%uḍumbara%} tree, and each of them to eat a
<div n="lb">certain {%caru%} (sacrificial offering), consecrated with hymns.
<div n="lb">The mother exchanged both the trees and the {%carus. Ṛcīka%}
<div n="lb">had placed the entire {%brahman%}-energy in {%Satyavatī's caru%} and
<div n="lb">the {%kṣatriya%}-energy in that of her mother; “therefore, thy
<div n="lb">mother will give birth to an excellent brahman and thou to
<div n="lb">a terrible {%kṣatriya.%}” {%Satyavatī%} prevailed upon him, that
<div n="lb">not her son, but her son's son should be such. Then, by the
<div n="lb">favour of {%Ṛcīka,%} she gave birth to {%Jamadagni,%} and the wife
<div n="lb">of {%Gādhi%} to the Brahmarṣi (read {%brahmarṣiṃ%}) {%Viśvāmitra,%}
<div n="lb">versed in the {%Vedas (brahmavādinaṃ). Viśvāmitra%} attained
<div n="lb">to the state of a brahman, and became the founder of a race
<div n="lb">of brahmans. {%Madhucchanda,%} etc., (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were all sons of
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} (XIII, {@4@}).
