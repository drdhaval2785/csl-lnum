[{@Mārkaṇḍeyasamāsyāparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“section relating
<div n="lb">to the [Pāṇḍavas'] enjoying the company of Mārkaṇḍeya,”
<div n="lb">the 41st of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Mārkaṇḍeya-
<div n="lb">samāsyā.) § 451: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were dwelling at that
<div n="lb">very place (cf. v. 12547: {%caratāṃ marudhanvasu,%} “roaming
<div n="lb">about in deserts”), there set in the season of the rains (descrip-
<div n="lb">tion). Then in the autumn (description) they spent the holiest
<div n="lb">night, that of the full moon in the month of {%Kārttika,%} on
<div n="lb">the {%Sarasvatī%} with the ascetics. As soon as the dark fortnight
<div n="lb">set in, they with their charioteers and cooks entered the
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka%} forest (III, {@182@}).—§ 452: In the {%Kāmyaka%} wood
<div n="lb">many {%brahmans%} came to them, and one of them said that
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} would come to see them. Immediately
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} arrived with {%Satyabhāmā%} on his chariot that was yoked
<div n="lb">with {%Śaibya%} and {%Sugrīva.%} He told {%Kṛṣṇā%} that her sons,
<div n="lb">though her father and brothers proffered them a kingdom and
<div n="lb">territories, found no joy in the house of {%Drupada,%} but that
<div n="lb">in the town of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} they were directed by {%Subhadrā%}
<div n="lb">and received instruction from {%Raukmiṇeya%} even as {%Aniruddha,%}
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu, Sunītha,%} and {%Bhānu,%} and were instructed by the
<div n="lb">young {%Abhimanyu%} in the use of arms. Then he suggested to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with the {%Daśārhas, Kukuras,%} and {%Andhakas,%}
<div n="lb">to kill {%Duryodhana,%} etc. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said they would stand
<div n="lb">by their promise, and after the thirteen years take refuge in
[Page469-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa.%}—§ 453: While they were thus talking, the {%brahmarṣi%}
<div n="lb">{%Mārkaṇḍeya (b)%} appeared. When they had taken their seats,
<div n="lb">the {%devarṣi Nārada%} also came to visit them. {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">mentioning the happiness of the impious {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} about the results of men's acts. {%Mārkaṇ-%}
<div n="lb">{%ḍeya,%} after having described the {%Kṛta%} age and the subsequent
<div n="lb">deterioration, answered the question (III, {@183@}).—§§ 454—5:
<div n="lb">{%Brāhmaṇamāhātmya-kathana%} (q.v.).—§ 456: {%Sarasvatī-%}
<div n="lb">{%Tārkṣya-saṃvāda%} (q.v.).—§ 457: {%Vaivasvatopākhyāna%} (q.v.).
<div n="lb">—§ 458: {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} saying that {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} alone worships
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} at the time of the great dissolution, when he sleeps
<div n="lb">in a lotus flower, and when he awakes to recreate the world,
<div n="lb">asked him to explain the causes of things. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Janārdana%} attired in yellow robes is the great creator of
<div n="lb">everything. After the dissolution, creation again comes to life.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta yuga%} = 4,000 years + dawn 400 years + eve 400 years;
<div n="lb">{%Tretā yuga%} = 3,000 + 300 + 300; {%Dvāpara yuga%} = 2,000
<div n="lb">+ 200 + 200; {%Kali yuga%} = 1,000 + 100 + 100; altogether
<div n="lb">a cycle of {%yugas%} = 12,000 years. After the {%Kali yuga%} is over,
<div n="lb">the {%Kṛta yuga%} comes again. One thousand cycles constitute
<div n="lb">a day of {%Brahmán.%} Description of {%Kali yuga (b).%} Then
<div n="lb">comes a long drought, and seven suns drink up all water
<div n="lb">and reduce wood and grass to ashes. Then the {%Samvartaka%}
<div n="lb">fire with wind penetrates into {%Rasātala%} and terrifies the gods,
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas,%} and {%Yakṣas,%} and consumes this world with gods,
<div n="lb">{%Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Uragas,%} and {%Rākṣasas.%} And
<div n="lb">there rise in the sky deep masses of clouds flooding the entire
<div n="lb">surface of the earth and showering incessantly for twelve years.
<div n="lb">Then {%Svayambhū,%} dwelling in the lotus, drinks this terrible
<div n="lb">wind and goes to sleep.—§ 459: When all has become water,
<div n="lb">I (i.e. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}) alone wander in affliction and become
<div n="lb">fatigued, and find no resting-place. Then I behold a vast
<div n="lb">banyan-tree, and on a couch attached to a bough of that tree
<div n="lb">a fair boy with yellow robes, with the mark of {%Śrīvatsa.%} He
<div n="lb">caused me to enter his body through the mouth, and then
<div n="lb">I beheld the whole earth with cities and kingdoms, {%Gaṅgā,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śatadru,%} etc. (enumeration) (<lang n="greek"></lang>), gods, {%Sādhyas, Rudras,%}
<div n="lb">{%Ādityas,%} etc. (enumeration) (<lang n="greek"></lang>), At last I was suddenly
<div n="lb">projected through his open mouth by a gust of wind. Within
<div n="lb">that very moment I acquired a new sight and beheld myself
<div n="lb">emancipated {%(nirmuktaṃ).%} I wished to know his self. Then
<div n="lb">he spoke to me (III, {@188@}): “The gods even do not know me
<div n="lb">truly. I am {%Nārāyaṇa%} (v. 12952: “in ancient times I called
<div n="lb">the waters {%nārā,%} and because the waters have ever been
<div n="lb">my {%ayana%} [home], therefore I have been called {%Nārāyaṇa%}”),
<div n="lb">the eternal and unchangeable source of all things, the Creator
<div n="lb">and Destroyer of all; I am {%Viṣṇu, Brahmán, Śakra,%} etc.;
<div n="lb">in the form of {%Śeṣa%} I support this earth, in the form of
<div n="lb">a boar I raised it when sunk in water; I am the {%Vaḍavāvaktra%}
<div n="lb">fire; from my mouth, arms, thighs, and feet sprang {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriyas, vaiśyas,%} and {%śūdras;%} from me spring the {%Ṛg.-,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sāma-, Yajur-,%} and {%Atharva-veda;%} I am the {%Samvartaka%} fire,
<div n="lb">the {%Samvartaka%} wind, the {%Samvartaka%} sun, and the {%Samvartaka%}
<div n="lb">fire(!) (v. 12966 foll.); the stars are the pores of my skin,
<div n="lb">etc. When virtue and morality decrease, I create myself
<div n="lb">into new forms; in the {%Kṛta%} age I become white, etc. (see
<div n="lb">§§ 426{%b,%} 427, 428, 429). When the end comes, I alone in
<div n="lb">the form of {%Kāla%} destroy the three worlds, etc. The grandsire
<div n="lb">of all creatures {%(Sarvalokapitāmaha)%} is half of my body. I
<div n="lb">am the bearer of the conch-shell, the discus, and the mace.
<div n="lb">For a period of 1,000 cycles of {%yugas%} I sleep, overwhelming
<div n="lb">all creatures in insensibility, and I stay here, in the form of
<div n="lb">a boy though I am old, until {%Brahmán%} wakes up; under the
[Page469-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">form of {%Brahmán%} I have repeatedly granted thee boons
<div n="lb">When {%Brahmán (Sarvalokapitāmaha)%} awakes, I will then
<div n="lb">alone create all creatures.” Then he disappeared, and I
<div n="lb">{%(Mārkaṇḍeya)%} beheld this creation start into life. And that
<div n="lb">deity is {%Kṛṣṇa,%} thy relative. In consequence of the boon
<div n="lb">granted by him memory does not fail me, my life is long,
<div n="lb">and death is under my control (v. 13002). Then all bowed
<div n="lb">down unto {%Jaṇārdana%} (i.e. {%Kṛṣṇa%}), who comforted them
<div n="lb">(III, {@189@}).—§ 460: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him about the future
<div n="lb">cause of the government {%(sāmrājya)%} of the earth. {%Mārkaṇḍeya,%}
<div n="lb">having given a short description of the other {%yugas,%} described
<div n="lb">in detail the {%Kali-yuga (b);%} “in the new {%Kṛta-yuga, Kalkin (c)%}
<div n="lb">will arise.” Then {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} gave {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} some
<div n="lb">moral precepts and exhortations (III, {@190-1@}).—§ 461:
<div n="lb">{%Vāmadevacarita%} (q.v.).—§ 462: {%Baka-Śakra-saṃvāda%} (q.v.).
<div n="lb">§ 463: {%Śibi%} (q.v.).—§ 464: {%Nāhuṣa-carita%} (v. {%Yayāti%}).—
<div n="lb">§ 465, on the same topic: There were two learned and able
<div n="lb">kings, {%Vṛṣadarbha%} and {%Seduka. Seduka%} knew that {%Vṛṣa-%}
<div n="lb">{%darbha%} had from his boyhood an unuttered vow, that he
<div n="lb">would give no other metal to {%brahmans%} than gold and silver.
<div n="lb">He once sent a {%brahman,%} who asked him for 1,000 horses for
<div n="lb">his preceptor, to {%Vṛṣadarbha,%} who whipped him and then
<div n="lb">gave him a day's tribute (which was more than the value of
<div n="lb">1,000 horses), “because he had whipped him” (III, {@196@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 466: {%Śibi%} (q.v.).—§ 467: {%Rājanyamahābhāgya%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 468: {%Indradyumnopākhyāna%} (q.v.).—§ 469: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in what condition (age) a man should practise
<div n="lb">charity, {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} enumerated four kinds of futile life and
<div n="lb">sixteen kinds of futile charity. The {%brahmans%} save others
<div n="lb">and themselves by {%japa, mantra,%} and {%homa.%} He next enume-
<div n="lb">rated the {%brahmans%} that should be excluded from {%śrāddhas,%}
<div n="lb">and gave other moral precepts (of offerings to the gods of
<div n="lb">flowers and sandals and pastes, entertainment of guests); then
<div n="lb">he enumerated the persons to whom one should make gifts;
<div n="lb">the effects of various gifts to {%brahmans%} (food is the best).—
<div n="lb">§ 470: {%Yamaloka%} (q.v.).—§ 471: Precepts about gifts,
<div n="lb">washing the feet of {%brahmans,%} etc. Blessing upon the reader.—
<div n="lb">§ 472: Three kinds of purity (speech, deed, water); by
<div n="lb">adoring {%sandhyā%} and reciting {%Gāyatrī%} one is protected against
<div n="lb">sin and evil results from gifts, against inauspicious stars, and
<div n="lb">against {%Rākṣasas.%} Greatness of the {%brahmans.%} The carrying
<div n="lb">of three staves, etc., are useless if the heart be not pure. They
<div n="lb">who do not commit sin in {%manas,%} word, deed, and {%buddhi%} do
<div n="lb">really practise austerities (v. 13468: by {%tapas%} one may
<div n="lb">attain {%Svarga,%} by charity enjoyment, by knowledge salvation
<div n="lb">{%(mokṣa),%} by bathing in {%tīrthas%} purgation from sins).—
<div n="lb">§ 473: On the effects of various gifts at various times
<div n="lb">(v. 13480: the first offspring of fire is gold, earth springs
<div n="lb">from {%Viṣṇu,%} and the cows from the sun; he, therefore, that
<div n="lb">gives away gold, land, and kine, has given the three worlds
<div n="lb">[of {%Agni, Viṣṇu,%} and the Sun]) (III, {@200@}).—§ 474: Having
<div n="lb">heard the history of {%Indradyumna, Yudhiṣṭhira,%} saying that
<div n="lb">{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} knew the gods, {%Dānavas, Rākṣasas,%} the royal
<div n="lb">genealogies and the genealogies of the {%ṛṣis,%} and {%Gandharvas,%}
