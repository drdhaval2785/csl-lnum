<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra's%} lament and inquiries (VI, {@14@}). {%Sañjaya,%} praising
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} for his {%yoga%}-power, i.e. the celestial vision (description)
<div n="lb">he had given him, began his discourse on the battle.
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} gave {%Duḥśāsana%} instructions about the protection
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīṣma%} from {%Śikhaṇḍin%} (VI, {@15@}). The two hosts arrayed
<div n="lb">at sunrise (description). {%Śakuni,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), stood each at the
<div n="lb">head of an {%akṣauhiṇī;%} the 11th under {%Bhīṣma%} (description)
<div n="lb">stood in advance of the whole army. The {%Sṛñjayas,%} headed
<div n="lb">by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} looked [beholding {%Bhīṣma%}] like small
<div n="lb">animals beholding a lion (VI, {@16@}). On that day {%Soma%}
<div n="lb">approached the region of the {%Pitṛs.%} Omens. Every morning
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%} prayed for victory for the {%Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb">though they must fight for {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} according to their
<div n="lb">pledge: {%Bhīṣma%} briefly addressed the {%Kuru%} army, mentioning
<div n="lb">{%Nābhaga,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), as examples. {%Karṇa,%} with his friends
<div n="lb">and relatives, laid aside his weapons owing to {%Bhīṣma.%}

<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} from behind, etc. (VI, {@18@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} according to the words of the M.-ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati,%} to array
<div n="lb">the troops in needle-mouthed {%(śucīmukha)%} array. {%Arjuna%} said
<div n="lb">that he would make a {%Vajra%} array, which was designed by
<div n="lb">{%Indra;%} they would all seek shelter with {%Bhīma.%} The leaders
<div n="lb">were {%Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Omens (VI, {@19@}). When the sun
<div n="lb">rose the {%Kauravas%} stood facing the west, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} facing
<div n="lb">the east. Disposition of the two armies: {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(VI, {@20@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sorrowfully addressed {%Arjuna,%} who
<div n="lb">consoled him with his truth, righteousness, etc., which {%Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} and {%Droṇa%} knew, and which were a powerful aid
<div n="lb">towards victory according to {%Bráhman's%} words to {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">etc., on the occasion of the battle between the gods and
<div n="lb">the {%Asuras;%} “victory clings to Kṛṣṇa”; it was by
<div n="lb">choosing him that the gods under {%Indra%} had vanquished the
<div n="lb">{%Asuras%} (VI, {@21@}). Disposition of the troops in the {%Pāṇḍava%}
<div n="lb">army: {%Śikhaṇḍin,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VI, {@22@}). At {%Kṛṣṇa's%} instance
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} recited a hymn to {%Durgā. Durgā%} appeared and gave
<div n="lb">him assurances of victory. Merits of this hymn (VI, {@23@}).
<div n="lb">The combatants of both armies were cheerful, etc. (VI, {@24@}).
<div n="lb">Before {%Droṇa, Duryodhana%} compared the combatants of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍava%} army: {%Bhīma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), with his own; {%Droṇa,%}
[Page114-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc., blew {%Pāñcajanya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to place his chariot between the two armies, so
<div n="lb">that he might see who were assembled to fight. Beholding his
<div n="lb">relatives, etc., {%Arjuna%} was filled with compassion and overcome
<div n="lb">with despondency, and refused to fight (VI, {@25@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">appealed to {%Arjuna%} to shake off his despondency, but in
<div n="lb">vain. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then declared to {%Arjuna%} the nature and the
<div n="lb">attributes of the soul, and the folly of grieving for the dead,
<div n="lb">and exhorted him to comply with the duties of his order by
<div n="lb">fighting fairly, and to apply himself to work for work's
<div n="lb">sake, and not for the sake of its results. {%Kṛṣṇa%} spoke of
<div n="lb">contemplation (VI, {@26@}); on the {%Sāṅkhyas%} and {%Yogins;%} on
<div n="lb">devotion to work (VI, {@27@}); on his reiterated births; on the
<div n="lb">best way (VI, {@28@}); on abandonment of actions and application
<div n="lb">to actions; he has the right view who considers {%Sāṅkhya%}
<div n="lb">and {%Yoga%} as one (VI, {@29@}); on the means of rising to
<div n="lb">devotion (VI, {@30@}); on {%Kṛṣṇa%} identified with {%Bráhman%}
<div n="lb">(VI, {@31@}); on the nature of Bráhman (VI, {@32@}); on {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">as the pervader of the whole universe, and as the enjoyer of
<div n="lb">all sacrifice (VI, {@33@}); on {%Kṛṣṇa%} as the source of the gods,
<div n="lb">etc. {%Arjuna%} believed what {%Kṛṣṇa%} said, and what also had
<div n="lb">been said by all the Ṛ., and the D.-ṛ. {%Nārada,%} and {%Asita%}
<div n="lb">{%Devala%} and {%Vyāsa. Kṛṣṇa%} declared his divine perfections
<div n="lb">to {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@34@}), and disclosed his supreme sovereign
<div n="lb">form; he was praised by {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@35@}); he discoursed on
<div n="lb">the two kinds of worshippers (VI, {@36@}); on the body and
<div n="lb">the soul, etc., the supreme object of knowledge (VI, {@37@});
<div n="lb">on the three {%guṇas%} (Goodness, Passion, and Darkness) (VI,
