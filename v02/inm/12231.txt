[{@Vītahavyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Vītahavya”). § 736{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: While
<div n="lb">{%Manu,%} in days of yore, was righteously ruling his subjects, he
<div n="lb">obtained a righteous son {%Śaryāti,%} in whose race were born
<div n="lb">{%Vatsa's%} sons, the kings {%Haihaya%} and {%Tālajaṅgha. Haihaya%}
<div n="lb">(or {%Vītahavya%}) had 10 wives and 100 heroic sons, who all
<div n="lb">studied the {%Vedas%} and {%Dhanurveda.%} In {%Kāśi%} was king
<div n="lb">{%Haryaśva,%} the grandfather of {%Divodāsa.%} The sons of king
<div n="lb">{%Haihaya (Vītahavya-dāyādaiḥ)%} invaded {%Kāśi%} and slew king
<div n="lb">{%Haryaśva%} in a battle between the {%Gaṅgā%} and the {%Yamunā,%}
<div n="lb">and then went back to their own delightful city in the {%Vatsa%}-
<div n="lb">country. Meanwhile {%Haryaśva's%} son {%Sudeva%} was installed as
<div n="lb">{%Kāśi%}-king. The 100 sons of {%Vītahavya%} once more came and
<div n="lb">defeated him in battle, and then returned to their own city.
<div n="lb">After this, {%Sudeva's%} son {%Divodāsa%} became installed as {%Kāśi%}-
<div n="lb">king; at the command of {%Indra%} he built the city of {%Vārāṇasī%}
<div n="lb">between the {%Gaṅgā%} and the southern bank of the {%Gomatī.%}
<div n="lb">The {%Haihayas%} again attacked {%Divodāsa;%} he fought for 1,000
<div n="lb">days, lost his army, left his capital, and fled away to the
<div n="lb">retreat of {%Bharadvāja,%} who was his priest, and performed a
<div n="lb">sacrifice, in consequence of which {%Pratardana%} was born to
<div n="lb">him. On the same day when {%Pratardana%} was born, he grew
<div n="lb">as great as a boy of 13 years, and mastered the {%Vedas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Dhanurveda, Bharadvāja%} (aided by {%Yoga%}) having entered into
<div n="lb">the prince and caused all the energy of the universe to enter
<div n="lb">his body (he was praised by bards and D-ṛ., etc.; description).
<div n="lb">{%Divodāsa%} installed {%Pratardana%} as {%yuvarāja%} and ordered him
<div n="lb">to march against the sons of {%Vītahavya. Pratardana%} speedily
<div n="lb">crossed the {%Gaṅgā%} and proceeded against the city of the
<div n="lb">{%Vītahavyas%} and slew them all. King {%Vītahavya%} fled away to
<div n="lb">the retreat of {%Bhṛgu. Pratardana%} followed in his footsteps
<div n="lb">and ordered {%Bhṛgu%} to surrender king {%Vītahavya. Bhṛgu%}
<div n="lb">said: “there is no {%kṣatriya%} in this retreat; they who
<div n="lb">are here are all brahmans.” {%Pratardana%} returned home,
<div n="lb">and {%Vītahavya%} became a Br-ṛ. in consequence of {%Bhṛgu's%}
<div n="lb">statement. {%Vītahavya > Gṛtsamada%} (V-ṛ., resembling {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">and, therefore, once afflicted by Dai.; alleged quotation from
<div n="lb">the {%Ṛgveda%}) {%> Sutejas > Varcas > Vihavya > Vitatya > Satya >%}
<div n="lb">{%Santa >%} Ṛ. {%Śravas > Tamas > Prakāśa > Vāgindra > Pramati%} (B.
<div n="lb">{%°mi°%}) (mastering the {%Vedas%} and {%Vedāṅgas%}) {%> Rura%} (begotten
<div n="lb">upon Aps. {%Ghṛtācī%}) {%> Śunaka%} (begotten upon {%Pramadvarā%}) {%>%}
