<div n="lb">the battle with maces”). Cf. Gadāparvan, Gadāyuddha.
<div n="lb">§ 613: Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Sañjaya%} related:
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} agreed to fight his foes, one at a time (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} granted his request, adding that if he could
<div n="lb">slay even one of the five {%Pāṇḍavas%} he would remain king.
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} rose from the lake and challenged the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} taunted him with his unfair conduct in
<div n="lb">slaying {%Abhimanyu%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (IX, {@32@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} reproved {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} for his rashness in staking everything on the result
<div n="lb">of such a single combat with {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bhīmasena%}
<div n="lb">assured {%Kṛṣṇa%} that {%Duryodhana%} would be no match for him in
<div n="lb">an encounter with the mace (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%} applauded {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">and exhorted him to slay {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">applauded {%Bhīma; Bhīma's%} boastful address (<lang n="greek"></lang>) to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">and {%Duryodhana; Duryodhana's%} dignified reply, applauded by
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sṛñjayas;%} the elephants began to grunt
<div n="lb">and the steeds to neigh; the weapons of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} blazed
<div n="lb">forth of their own accord (IX, {@33@}).—§ 614: When the battle
<div n="lb">between {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryodhana%} was about to commence,
<div n="lb">{%Bala-Rāma (b),%} having heard that that battle between his
<div n="lb">two disciples was about to begin, came and was worshipped by
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he said that forty-two days
<div n="lb">had passed since he departed, having set out under the
<div n="lb">constellation {%Puṣya%} and come back under the constellation
<div n="lb">{%Śravaṇa;%} he was clad in blue robes and of fair complexion.
<div n="lb">Then that dreadful encounter took place (IX, {@34@}).—§ 615:
<div n="lb">Requested by {%Janamejaya%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Vaiśampāyana%} related how
<div n="lb">{%Bala-Rāma%} had determined upon and set out (under the
<div n="lb">constellation {%Maitra%}) on a pilgrimage to the {%tīrthas%} on the
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), having let the sacred fire be brought from {%Dvārakā%}
<div n="lb">and the priests, and having given away rich donations to every-
<div n="lb">one who wished for them, accompanied by priests, friends,
<div n="lb">brahmans, chariots, elephants, steeds, and servants, visiting
<div n="lb">all the sacred places along her course. In the course of his
<div n="lb">wanderings he at last came to {%Kurukṣetra.%} Requested by
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Vaiśampāyana%} related the {%Baladevatīrthayātrā%}
<div n="lb">(q.v.) (IX, {@35—54@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">related: Beholding {%Bala-Rāma, Duryodhana%} rejoiced.
<div n="lb">According to the proposal of {%Bala-Rāma, Yudhiṣṭhira%} with
[Page286-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">his brothers and {%Duryodhana%} proceeded westwards to {%Samanta-%}
<div n="lb">{%pañcaka%} on the southern side of the {%Sarasvatī.%} D. and
<div n="lb">Cā. praised {%Duryodhana.%} Description of {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Duryodhana%} told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (who was standing
<div n="lb">among his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rāma%}) to behold the battle,
<div n="lb">protected by the {%Kaikeyas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). That large assembly of
<div n="lb">kings sat down, as did also {%Bala-Rāma,%} who was worshipped by
<div n="lb">all around him. {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryodhana%} stood inciting each
<div n="lb">other with violent speeches (IX, {@55@}). The dispute between
<div n="lb">the two heroes (<lang n="greek"></lang>). At last {%Duryodhana%} said, “What is
<div n="lb">the use of bragging? fight with me,” and was applauded
<div n="lb">by the {%Somakas,%} etc. The elephants grunted aloud and the
<div n="lb">steeds neighed repeatedly; the weapons of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">blazed forth of their own accord (IX, {@56@}). Description of
<div n="lb">the combat; D., G., and men wondered; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Somakas%} feared; adopting the manœuvre called {%Kauśika,%}
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} baffled {%Bhīma's%} mace; as {%Duryodhana%} once fell
<div n="lb">down to the earth, the {%Sṛñjayas%} cried aloud, so also did the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas; Bhīmasena%} then had his coat of mail fractured and
<div n="lb">was prostrated on the ground, but rose, steadying himself
<div n="lb">with great effort (IX, {@57@}). {%Arjuna%} inquired of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">about the relative merits of the two combatants; {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">said that their training had been equal, but {%Bhīma%} was
<div n="lb">superior in strength; {%Duryodhana%} was superior in skill and
<div n="lb">had had more practice; by fighting fairly {%Bhīma%} would never
<div n="lb">succeed in winning, but by fighting unfairly he would surely
<div n="lb">be able to slay {%Duryodhana,%} just as the {%Asuras%} were vanquished
<div n="lb">by the gods, {%Virocana%} and {%Vṛtra%} by {%Indra%} with the aid of
<div n="lb">deception; “{%Bhīma%} has vowed to break the thighs of {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} with his mace; let him accomplish that vow of his”;
<div n="lb">he censured {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} for his folly, and quoted a verse
<div n="lb">uttered by {%Uśanas;%} “{%Duryodhana%} has practised with the
<div n="lb">mace for full thirteen years.” {%Arjuna%} struck his own left
<div n="lb">thigh before the eyes of {%Bhīmasena,%} who understood the sign.
<div n="lb">As {%Duryodhana%} set his heart on the manœuvre called {%dvasthāna%}
<div n="lb">and jumped upwards, {%Bhīmasena%} hurled his mace at the thighs
<div n="lb">of {%Duryodhana%} and fractured them. Portents appeared; showers
<div n="lb">of blood and showers of dust were poured by {%Indra;%} a loud
<div n="lb">noise was made by Y., Rā., and Pś. (description of the
<div n="lb">portents); the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were filled with
<div n="lb">anxiety; D., G., Si., and Cā. went away (IX, {@58@}). The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Somakas%} rejoiced; {%Bhīmasena%} rebuked {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana,%} and touched his head with his left foot, which was
<div n="lb">censured by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who grieved for {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(IX, {@59@}); {%Baladeva's%} wrath was excited upon seeing {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} struck below the navel; he rushed on to slay {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">but was seized and pacified by {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Baladeva%} praised
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} and cursed {%Bhīmasena,%} and then ascended his
<div n="lb">chariot and proceeded towards {%Dvārakā.%} The {%Pāñcālas,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), became dejected; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena,%}
<div n="lb">etc., and {%Duryodhana%} spoke about what had passed (IX, {@80@})
<div n="lb">({%Kṛṣṇa%} asking the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors to forbear insulting
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana; Duryodhana's%} angry reply to {%Kṛṣṇa,%} charging
<div n="lb">him with every unfair act in course of the battle; {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">reminded {%Duryodhana%} of his own evil acts, and referred to his
<div n="lb">miserable end as the inevitable consequence of those acts;
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana's%} boast with reference to his end, which he
<div n="lb">pronounced to be most glorious) (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Celestial showers
<div n="lb">descended on {%Duryodhana's%} head; G., Aps., and Si. praised
<div n="lb">him. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} became ashamed; but {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">justified the use of unfair means for the slaughter of the {%Kuru%}
<div n="lb">warriors (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (IX, {@61@}). The {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors proceeded to the
<div n="lb">{%Kuru%} camp, which was entirely deserted (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused
[Page287-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} to take down the {%Gāṇḍīva%} and his inexhaustible quivers,
<div n="lb">and then to dismount; then {%Kṛṣṇa%} also dismounted; the
<div n="lb">celestial ape disappeared, and the chariot (burnt by {%Droṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} with the {%Brāhma%} weapon), with its steeds, etc., was
<div n="lb">reduced to ashes. {%Kṛṣṇa%} congratulated {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} on his
<div n="lb">victory, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} attributed that victory to {%Kṛṣṇa's%}
<div n="lb">power (<lang n="greek"></lang>). In the encampment of the {%Kurus%} they found great
<div n="lb">wealth; at {%Kṛṣṇa's%} suggestion the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">resolved to pass the night at a spot outside the camp, on the
<div n="lb">banks of the {%Oghavatī.%} They then dispatched {%Kṛṣṇa%} to
<div n="lb">{%Hāstinapura%} in order to pacify the wrath of {%Gāndhārī,%} and to
<div n="lb">comfort her and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} He set out with {%Dāruka%} upon
<div n="lb">his chariot, yoked with {%Śaibya%} and {%Sugrīva%} (IX, {@62@}). Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} said that the reason why {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} sent {%Kṛṣṇa%} to {%Hāstinapura%} was his fear that {%Gāndhārī,%}
<div n="lb">by means of her ascetic merit, should reduce the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to
<div n="lb">ashes, because {%Duryodhana%} had been slain unfairly (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “{%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">will be there.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused {%Dāruka%} to equip his chariot, and
<div n="lb">quickly set out for {%Hāstinapura.%} He arrived at {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
<div n="lb">palace, where {%Vyāsa%} had arrived before him; he comforted
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and {%Gāndhārī%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who said that her
<div n="lb">heart had again become steady (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} came to
<div n="lb">know the evil that was meditated by {%Aśvatthāman,%} and
<div n="lb">suddenly took leave, requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Gāndhārī%}
<div n="lb">to protect the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and proceeded with {%Dāruka. Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">comforted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Kṛṣṇa%} arrived at the camp and
<div n="lb">informed the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (IX, {@63@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} narrated the lamentations of {%Duryodhana%} while lying
<div n="lb">on the field with his thighs broken (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he thought himself
<div n="lb">happy, and asked {%Sañjaya%} to bring his message to his parents
<div n="lb">and to {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (“you should never place any
<div n="lb">confidence in the {%Pāṇḍavas%}”), and took leave of the message-
<div n="lb">bearers (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he was confident that {%Cārvāka,%} the mendicant
<div n="lb">devotee, would avenge his death. Thousands of men, with
<div n="lb">eyes full of tears, fled away; the earth trembled, etc. The
<div n="lb">messengers went and informed {%Aśvatthāman%} and then went
<div n="lb">away (IX, {@64@}). {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came to {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">who lay surrounded by carnivorous animals, etc. {%Aśvatthā-%}
<div n="lb">{%man's%} lament and {%Duryodhana's%} reply (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">vowed to slay all the {%Pāñcālas; Duryodhana%} let {%Kṛpa%} install
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} as the {%Kuru%} generalissimo; then they took leave
<div n="lb">of {%Duryodhana%} and left him alone (IX, {@65@}).
