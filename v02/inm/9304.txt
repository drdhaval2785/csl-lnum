[{@Sainyaniryāṇaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating
<div n="lb">to the marching out of the troops,” the 63rd of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Sainyaniryāṇa). § 570: The {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">had seven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} led by {%Drupada,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">consulted with his brothers about the election of a general-
<div n="lb">issimo, who might also withstand {%Bhīṣma. Sahadeva,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">proposed {%Virāṭa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%} named {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%}
<div n="lb">who was elected. Then they marched out to {%Kurukṣetra%}
<div n="lb">(description), with {%Bhīma%} in the van, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">with her ladies, etc., remained at {%Upaplavya.%} The {%Kekaya%}
<div n="lb">princes, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) marched behind {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} keeping
<div n="lb">him in their centre. In the rear were {%Virāṭa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">40,000 chariots, etc. {%Anādhṛṣṭi,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) marched
<div n="lb">surrounding {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna.%} Entering {%Kurukṣetra,%}
<div n="lb">they blew their conches, also {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna;%}
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcajanya%} filled them with joy (V, {@152@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">encamped on {%Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) each did some
<div n="lb">special work. At the holy {%Hiraṇvatī%} (an excellent {%tīrtha,%}
<div n="lb">with sacred water, without pointed pebbles and mire),
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} caused a moat to be excavated. There were
<div n="lb">assembled hundreds upon hundreds of skilled mechanics in
<div n="lb">receipt of regular wages, and surgeons and physicians, etc.
<div n="lb">Then their allies began to march thither (V, {@152@}). When
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} had departed, {%Duryodhana%} urged {%Kaṛna, Duḥśāsana,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Śakuni%} to make preparations for battle, which was fixed
<div n="lb">to commence the next morning (I, {@153@}). At the request of
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa%} related {%Duryodhana's,%} etc., project of
<div n="lb">imprisoning him; “neither {%Bhīṣma%} nor {%Droṇa%} said any-
<div n="lb">thing on that subject; indeed, all of them follow {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">except {%Vidura…%} War is that which should now take
<div n="lb">place.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} gave order to array the troops, but
<div n="lb">then he complained that he should slay his preceptors, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} reminded him of what {%Kuntī%} and {%Vidura%} had said
<div n="lb">through {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} affirmed it. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">their soldiers passed the night in great happiness (V, {@154@}).
<div n="lb">After that night had passed away, {%Duryodhana%} arranged his
<div n="lb">eleven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} (description), under {%Kṛpa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(V, {@155@}). Referring to a contest between the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">whom also the {%vaiśyas%} and the {%śūdras%} followed, and the
[Page608-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriyas%} among the {%Haihayas (b), Duryodhana%} urged
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} to become their generalissimo. {%Bhīṣma%} said that
<div n="lb">he did not see upon earth the warrior that was equal to
<div n="lb">him, except {%Arjuna;%} but {%Arjuna%} would never openly fight
<div n="lb">with him; {%Bhīṣma%} said he could, in a trice, destroy the
<div n="lb">universe with D., As., Rā., and men; but the {%Pāṇḍavas%} he
<div n="lb">could not exterminate; but he would slay every day
<div n="lb">10,000; and either {%Karṇa%} or {%Bhīṣma%} should fight first.
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} declared he would not fight before {%Bhīṣma%} was slain;
<div n="lb">then he would fight with {%Arjuna.%} Then {%Bhīṣma%} was
<div n="lb">solemnly installed, under a bloody shower, etc. Then they
<div n="lb">marched out to {%Kurukṣetra,%} and {%Duryodhana%} and {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">caused the camps to be measured out on a level part of the
<div n="lb">plain (V, {@156@}). When {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} heard that {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">had been installed in the command of the {%Kuru%} army, he
<div n="lb">summoned his brothers and {%Vāsudeva,%} and selected seven
<div n="lb">leaders for his seven {%akṣauhiṇīs: Drupada,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (cf. <lang n="greek"></lang>!),
<div n="lb">and above them all {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna;%} and {%Dhanañjaya%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Arjuna%}) of curly hair was made the leader of all those
<div n="lb">leaders; and {%Kṛṣṇa%} the leader of {%Arjuna%} and driver of his
<div n="lb">steeds. {%Halāyudha%} (i.e. {%Balarāma%}), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) came there, and
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) rose from their seats and offered
<div n="lb">worship to {%Halāyudha. Halāyudha%} said that a fierce
<div n="lb">slaughter was inevitable, that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would certainly
<div n="lb">win because of the help of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} that he had repeatedly
<div n="lb">tried to prevail upon {%Kṛṣṇa%} to remain neuter; that he
<div n="lb">would himself do; but as he could not be without {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">he would repair to the {%tīrthas%} of the {%Sarasvatī.%} Then he set
<div n="lb">out for his {%tīrthayātrā%} (V, {@157@}). About this time there
<div n="lb">came to the {%Pāṇḍava%} camp {%Bhīṣmaka's (c)%} son {%Rukmin (d).%}
<div n="lb">He entered the camp with an {%akṣauhiṇī%} of troops, from
<div n="lb">desire of doing what was agreeable to {%Vāsudeva.%} He offered
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} his assistance, if he was afraid. He would slay
<div n="lb">everyone: {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Arjuna,%} mentioning his exploits
<div n="lb">against the {%G.,%} at {%Khāṇḍava,%} against the {%Nivātakavacas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kālakeyas,%} at {%Virāṭa's%} city, and that he had paid his respects
<div n="lb">for battle's sake to {%Rudra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would not say he was
<div n="lb">afraid. {%Rakmin%} then went to {%Duryodhana,%} saying the same
<div n="lb">words, and was rejected in the same way. Then the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} again consulted, presided over by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">(V, {@158@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} to tell him all that
<div n="lb">had happened in the matter of encamping, and complained
<div n="lb">that though he understood the defects, he could not with-
<div n="lb">stand {%Duryodhana. Sañjaya%} said that he ought not to impute
<div n="lb">the fault only to {%Duryodhana:%} “as to our acts, some say
<div n="lb">that everything is ordained by God; some that they are the
<div n="lb">result of free-will; others that they are the result of those
<div n="lb">of our past lives” (V, {@159@}).
