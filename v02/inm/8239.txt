[{@Pativratopākhyāna@}]¦ (“the story of the faithful wife”)
<div n="lb">and [{@Brāhmaṇavyādhasaṃvāda@}] (“a conversation
<div n="lb">between a brahman and a hunter”) (cf. Pativratāyā
<div n="lb">ākhyānaṃ). § 479 (Mārkaṇḍ.): Questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">about the virtue of women, {%Mārkaṇḍeya,%} saying that the
<div n="lb">work of a mother is more difficult than that of a father, and
<div n="lb">that for women neither sacrifices nor {%śrāddhas%} nor fasts are
<div n="lb">of any efficacy, but that they can win heaven only by serving
<div n="lb">their husbands (III, {@205@}), related: When the {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">{%Kauśika,%} who had studied the Vedas and the Upaniṣads,
<div n="lb">was reciting the Vedas under a tree, a female crane befouled
<div n="lb">his body, and looked upon with anger by {%Kauśika%} fell to
<div n="lb">the ground. {%Kauśika%} regretted his angry deed. When
<div n="lb">he had entered a village in order to procure alms, in
<div n="lb">a certain house the wife first served her husband, who came
<div n="lb">home tired and hungry, with food, etc. (description), and
<div n="lb">then began to conciliate the angry {%Kauśika,%} who blamed her
<div n="lb">for exalting her husband above the {%brahmans.%} She said that
<div n="lb">she was no she-crane, that she knew that the ocean had been
<div n="lb">made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">that the fire of their wrath had not to this day been
<div n="lb">extinguished in the forest of {%Daṇḍaka,%} but that she regarded
<div n="lb">her husband as her supreme god, and deserved forgiveness,
<div n="lb">that anger is a foe to men within themselves, and that
<div n="lb">the gods know him to be a {%brahman%} who has abandoned
<div n="lb">anger and passion, etc.; and who, though himself injured,
<div n="lb">never returns the injury, etc., that virtue {%(dharma)%} is difficult
<div n="lb">to understand, but must be based on truth; the ancients have
<div n="lb">declared that virtue depends on {%śruti,%} but it is variously
<div n="lb">defined {%(bahudhā dṛśyate)%} and subtle to be understood
<div n="lb">{%(sūkṣma);%} “thou art cognisant of virtue and studiest the
<div n="lb">Vedas; but I think, however, that thou dost not know what
<div n="lb">virtue really is; a fowler {%(vyādha)%} in {%Mithilā%} will discourse
<div n="lb">to thee on virtue.” {%Kauśika%} blessed her, and returned to his
<div n="lb">abode, reproaching himself (III, {@206@}).—§ 480: He set out
<div n="lb">for {%Mithilā%} (description), ruled over by {%Janaka,%} and found
<div n="lb">out the fowler, who was seated in a butcher's yard, selling
<div n="lb">venison and buffalo meat to a large crowd of buyers; but he
<div n="lb">at once went to {%Kauśika,%} and proving that he knew why he
<div n="lb">had come, he led him to his abode, where he honoured him
<div n="lb">duly, and explained to him that, notwithstanding his cruel
<div n="lb">trade, which he had inherited from his sires and grandsires,
<div n="lb">and which belonged to his caste by birth, he led a virtuous
<div n="lb">life, serving his superiors and old people, speaking truth, never
[Page546-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">envying others, giving to the best of his power, etc. In the
<div n="lb">kingdom of {%Janaka%} there did not exist a single subject that
<div n="lb">did not follow the duties of his caste. He did not slay the
<div n="lb">boars and buffaloes himself, nor did he eat meat himself;
<div n="lb">he fasted during the day and ate in the night; “even though
<div n="lb">the behaviour of his order be bad, a person may yet be himself
<div n="lb">of good behaviour; so also a person may become virtuous,
<div n="lb">although he may by profession be a slayer of animals.” It is
<div n="lb">the fault of the kings when the subjects decay, and monsters,
<div n="lb">dwarfs, etc., are produced, but {%Janaka%} ruled justly. If one
<div n="lb">repents a wrong done by him, he is delivered from his
<div n="lb">sin (v. 13751). If a man seeks redemption {%(kalyāṇam%}
<div n="lb">{%abhipadyate)%} after having committed a sin, he becomes purified
<div n="lb">of all his sins (v. 13756). It is temptation {%(lobha)%} that
<div n="lb">constitutes the basis of sin. Then he gave some advice as
<div n="lb">to what is virtuous conduct (v. 13794 foll.: “these three are
<div n="lb">said to constitute the perfect way {%(padaṃ)%} of the virtuous:
<div n="lb">a man must not do wrong to anybody, he must give alms,
<div n="lb">and must always be truthful”); (v. 13797 foll.: “freedom
<div n="lb">from malice, forbearance, peace of mind, contentment, pleasant
<div n="lb">speech, renunciation of desires and anger, virtuous conduct,
<div n="lb">and actions regulated according to the ordinances of the sacred
<div n="lb">texts, constitute the perfect way {%(mārgaṃ)%} of the virtuous”)
<div n="lb">(III, {@207@}). The fowler and the animals slain by him are
<div n="lb">driven by their {%karman%} in a former life. In days of yore
<div n="lb">2,000 animals and 2,000 cows used to be killed every day in
<div n="lb">the kitchen of king {%Rantideva;%} at the {%cāturmāsya%} animals are
<div n="lb">sacrificed; the {%śruti%} says, “The fires are fond of meat”
<div n="lb">(v. 13812), and at the sacrifices animals are killed by the
<div n="lb">regenerate, and these animals are purged of sin, and by
<div n="lb">{%mantras%} go to heaven. Regarding animal food this rule
<div n="lb">has been laid down by {%munis:%} Whoever partakes of animal
<div n="lb">food after having first offered it duly and respectfully
<div n="lb">{%(yathāvidhi yathāśrāddhaṃ)%} to the gods and the {%Pitṛs,%} is
<div n="lb">not polluted by the act. The {%śruti%} says, “Such a man is
<div n="lb">not one who partakes of animal food,” and a {%brahman%} who
<div n="lb">has intercourse with his wife during her season is a {%brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%cārin.%} King {%Saudāsa,%} under the influence of a curse, ate
<div n="lb">human flesh. Agriculture is considered to be praiseworthy,
<div n="lb">though the plough destroys many creatures. Seeds of
<div n="lb">rice, etc., are all living creatures. As to hunting and the
<div n="lb">cutting of trees and herbs, many creatures live in trees
<div n="lb">and fruits and water. The earth and the air are all swarming
<div n="lb">with living organisms, which are unconsciously destroyed by
<div n="lb">men from mere ignorance (III, {@208@}). When life is at stake
<div n="lb">and in the matter of marriage, it is justified to tell an untruth.
<div n="lb">Whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is
<div n="lb">considered to be truth {%(satyaṃ)%} (v. 13845; cf. v. 13990).
<div n="lb">The fowler discoursed upon the influence of {%karman%} upon
<div n="lb">metempsychosis and salvation ({%mokṣa; Brahmaṇaḥ padaṃ,%}
<div n="lb">v. 13895) (III, {@209@}).—§ 481: Questioned by {%Kauśika%}
<div n="lb">about the senses, the fowler discoursed about the sinful (in
<div n="lb">thought, word, and action (v. 13906); the evolution of sin
<div n="lb">is this: First {%manas%} is bent on {%vijñāna;%} thence successively
<div n="lb">originate {%kāma, roṣa, karman, rāga, dveṣa, lobha, moha, vyāja,%}
<div n="lb">{%adharma, pāpa%}). The virtuous man discerns these evils by
<div n="lb">means of his spiritual insight (v. 13908).—§ 482: Then he
<div n="lb">shortly enumerated the elements of the {%brāhmī vidyā%} (the
<div n="lb">universe, consisting of the five great elements, space, wind,
<div n="lb">fire, water, and earth, is {%Bráhman%} [neuter]; their qualities:
<div n="lb">sound, touch, form, flavour, and taste; {%manas, buddhi, ahaṅ-%}
<div n="lb">{%kāra;%} the five senses, {%ātman, rajas, sattva, tamas;%} the last
<div n="lb">seventeen are {%“rāśir avyaktasañjñakaḥ”,%} in all (with the
[Page546-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">objects of senses and the manifest and the unmanifest)
<div n="lb">twenty-four {%(caturviṃśaka ity eṣa vyaktāvyaktamayo guṇaḥ)%}
<div n="lb">[read {%gaṇah,%} cf. Hopkins, Great Epic, p. 34] (III, {@210@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 483: A somewhat more detailed explanation of the five
<div n="lb">elements and their qualities. The terms {%vyakta%} and {%avyakta%}
<div n="lb">(v. 13931). Salvation, etc., are dependent on self-discipline
<div n="lb">{%(tapas),%} that is impossible without subduing the senses. The
<div n="lb">body is like a chariot, the coachman being the soul, and
<div n="lb">the horses the six senses (III, {@211@}).—§ 484: The three
<div n="lb">qualities {%sattva, rajas,%} and {%tamas%} (III, {@212@}).—§ 485: The
<div n="lb">five vital airs {%(prāṇa, samāna, apāna, udāna, vyāna),%} that
<div n="lb">are all seated ({%pratiṣṭhitāḥ,%} v. 13973) in the navel, and by
<div n="lb">whose collision the internal fire is generated that digests the
<div n="lb">food. The arteries {%(nāḍyaḥ),%} issuing from the heart in all
<div n="lb">directions, carry the essence of food {%(annarasān)%} acted upon
<div n="lb">by the ten {%prāṇas.%} The perception of the internal spirit,
<div n="lb">purification of the heart, destroys the good and evil effects of
<div n="lb">actions and leads to eternal beatitude. That state of peace
<div n="lb">and purification of heart ({%prasādasya,%} v. 13984) is likened
<div n="lb">to the state of a person who in a cheerful state of mind
<div n="lb">{%(tṛptaḥ)%} sleeps soundly {%(sukhaṃ),%} or to a lamp shining on
<div n="lb">a windless spot, well kindled. Community with {%Bráhman%}
<div n="lb">cannot be taught to us even by the {%guru%} (v. 13992) (III, {@213@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 486: Saying “Thou shalt see by what means I have
<div n="lb">attained to this blissful state”, the fowler introduced {%Kauśika%}
<div n="lb">to his parents, whom he honoured together with his wife and
<div n="lb">children like gods (description; v. 14025: “I do what is
<div n="lb">agreeable to them, even though it be not strictly justifiable”)
<div n="lb">(III, {@214@}).—The fowler said: “Thou hast wronged thy
<div n="lb">father and thy mother, for thou hast left home without their
<div n="lb">permission, for the purpose of learning the {%Vedas,%} and they
<div n="lb">have become blind from grief at thy loss. Thereby thy
<div n="lb">ascetic merit, etc., have become useless to thee. Do return
<div n="lb">home this very day.” {%Kauśika%} acknowledged that the
<div n="lb">fowler had rescued him when he was on the point of
<div n="lb">falling into hell, and that he did not consider him to be
<div n="lb">a {%śūdra,%} as it was very difficult for a {%śūdra%} to learn the
<div n="lb">eternal religion {%(dharmaḥ);%} his being a {%śūdra%} must surely
<div n="lb">be due to any action in a former birth; this {%Kauśika%} wished
<div n="lb">to learn.—§ 487: The fowler told: “I was formerly
<div n="lb">a {%brahman,%} son of an eminent {%brahman,%} and versed in the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas%} and the {%Vedāṅgas,%} and friend of a king, who was
<div n="lb">accomplished in the {%Dhanurveda,%} and thence skilled in archery
<div n="lb">myself; one day, when I accompanied the king on a hunting
<div n="lb">expedition, I killed a {%ṛṣi,%} whom I took for a deer, and was
<div n="lb">cursed by him to be born as a fowler in the {%śūdra%} caste
<div n="lb">(III, {@215@}); but I prevailed upon him to grant me that
<div n="lb">I should remain a pious man and honour my parents, and
<div n="lb">thereby attain great perfection {%(siddhiṃ),%} remember my
<div n="lb">past life, and again become a {%brahman.%} I took the {%ṛṣi%} to
<div n="lb">the hermitage, and he did not die.”—{%Kauśika%} saluted him
<div n="lb">respectfully, and having returned home he honoured his old
<div n="lb">parents (III, {@216@}).
