<div n="lb">§ 10 (Parvas.): I, {@2,@} 339.—§ 596: In the evening, when
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna;%} having slain large numbers of {%Saṃśaptakas,%} pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded towards his tent, he said to {%Kṛṣṇa%} that his heart was
<div n="lb">affrighted; he noticed indications of disaster; {%Abhimanyu%}
<div n="lb">did not come out with smiles to receive him, etc. He
<div n="lb">remembered that {%Droṇa%} had this day formed the circular
<div n="lb">army, which none save {%Abhimanyu%} could break, but he had
[Page561-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">not taught him how to come out of it, after having pierced
<div n="lb">it; he had heard the leonine shouts of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛṣṇa%} had heard {%Yuyutsu%} censuring them for having
<div n="lb">slain a child instead of {%Arjuna,%} and then {%Yuyutsu%} had thrown
<div n="lb">away his weapons afflicted with rage and grief. {%Kṛṣṇa%} con-
<div n="lb">soled {%Arjuna,%} referring to the {%kṣatriya%} duties and heaven.
<div n="lb">None save {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (who were always
<div n="lb">acceptable to him) could address {%Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">addressing him, told (VII, {@72@}) him the particulars of
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu's%} heroism and fall. {%Arjuna%} vowed to slay
<div n="lb">{%Jayadratha%} before the setting of the morrow's sun (his oath);
<div n="lb">even as to {%As., D.,%} men, birds, snakes, {%P.,%} wanderers of the
<div n="lb">night, {%B.-ṛ., D.-ṛ.,%} etc., he said that they would not
<div n="lb">succeed in protecting him, even if he entered {%Rasātala,%} or
<div n="lb">ascended the firmament, or repaired to the city of the gods
<div n="lb">{%(Devapuraṃ)%} or the city of {%Diti (Diteḥ puraṃ);%} if the sun
<div n="lb">set before he had slain him, he would himself ascend the
<div n="lb">pyre. {%Arjuna%} bent the {%Gāṇḍīva, Kṛṣṇa%} blew the {%Pāñcajanya,%}
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} the {%Devadatta%} (VII, {@73@}). Having been informed by
<div n="lb">spies, {%Jayadratha%} was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear,
<div n="lb">thinking that not even {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), not even {%D., G., As.,%}
<div n="lb">{%U., Rā.,%} can protect him against {%Arjuna;%} he wished to
<div n="lb">return home. {%Duryodhana%} comforted him, saying that he,
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would protect him. {%Jayadratha,%} accompanied
<div n="lb">by {%Duryodhana,%} repaired that very night to {%Droṇa%} and
<div n="lb">questioned him about the difference between himself and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna. Droṇa%} said they had got the same instruction, but
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} was superior to {%Jayadratha%} in consequence of {%yoga%}
<div n="lb">and the hard life led by {%Arjuna; Droṇa%} would, however,
<div n="lb">protect him, forming an impenetrable array; and, moreover,
<div n="lb">death ought not to be an object of terror to him (VII, {@74@}).
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} remonstrated with {%Arjuna%} for his rash vow; the
<div n="lb">{%Kurus%} had expected an attack by {%Arjuna;%} now they will
<div n="lb">protect {%Jayadratha%} (who had mentioned {%Arjuna's%} encounter
<div n="lb">with {%Śiva, Hiraṇyapura,%} etc.); {%Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) would be in
<div n="lb">{%Jayadratha's%} van; {%Droṇa's%} army would be half a {%śakaṭa%} and
<div n="lb">half a lotus with a needle-mouthed array in the middle
<div n="lb">(VII, {@75@}). {%Arjuna%} assured {%Kṛṣṇa%} of his competence to
<div n="lb">accomplish his vow, notwithstanding {%Droṇa, Sā., R., V., A.,%}
<div n="lb">{%M.,%} with {%Indra, V.-D., D., P., G., Garuḍa,%} etc., by the
<div n="lb">means of {%Gāṇḍīva%} and the weapons he had obtained from
<div n="lb">{%Yama,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the {%Brāhma%} weapon (VII, {@76@}). The
<div n="lb">gods with {%Indra%} became very anxious. Sinister omens
<div n="lb">appeared in nature. {%Kṛṣṇa%} went to {%Arjuna's%} abode and
<div n="lb">comforted {%Subhadrā%} (with the {%kṣatriya%} duties, etc., and
<div n="lb">revenge) (VII, {@77@}). {%Subhadrā%} lamented over {%Abhimanyu,%}
<div n="lb">and said “fie on {%Bhīmasena,%} etc.” (<lang n="greek"></lang>), because they had not
<div n="lb">protected him. {%Draupadī%} and {%Uttarā%} came to her, lamenting
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Abhimanyu%} had obtained the most laudable
<div n="lb">and enviable goal. Then he returned to {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@78@}).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} performed his usual nightly sacrifice to {%Śiva. Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">with {%Dāruka%} repaired to his own tent. None in the {%Pāṇḍava%}
<div n="lb">camp slept that night, thinking of {%Arjuna.%} In the middle of
<div n="lb">the night {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Dāruka%} that he had resolved to
<div n="lb">fight to-morrow [if necessary]; he should equip his chariot,
<div n="lb">placing on it {%Kaumodakī,%} etc., making room for {%Garuḍa,%} and
<div n="lb">yoking thereto {%Balāhaka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); when hearing {%Pañcajanya%}
<div n="lb">emitting the shrill {%Ṛṣabha%} note, he should come to {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">(VII, {@79@}). {%Arjuna%} in a dream saw {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who told him
<div n="lb">not to grieve, and mentioned the {%Pāśupata%} weapon (with
<div n="lb">which {%Śiva%} slew all the {%Daityas%} in battle); if he remembered
<div n="lb">it now, he would be able to slay {%Jayadratha%} to-morrow;
<div n="lb">otherwise he should pray to {%Śiva.%} At the {%Brāhma%} hour,
[Page562-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} saw himself sojourning through the sky {%(Himavat);%}
<div n="lb">{%Maṇimat,%} frequented by {%Si.%} and {%Cā.,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) with {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">to where {%Śiva%} was seated with {%Pārvatī%} (description) (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} hymned {%Mahādeva%} (VII, {@80@}). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">saw that the offerings he had made every night to {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">had come to {%Śiva,%} and he mentally worshipped both {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Śiva. Śiva%} then told {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} where to
<div n="lb">fetch his bow and arrow from a lake of {%amṛta.%} In the
<div n="lb">lake they saw two terrible snakes; when they had uttered
<div n="lb">the {%Brahma Śatarudriya,%} the snakes assumed the forms of
<div n="lb">a bow and arrow. From {%Śiva's%} body there came out
<div n="lb">a {%brahmacārin%} of blue throat and red locks, and having
<div n="lb">showed {%Arjuna%} the use of the bow and arrow, and the {%mantras,%}
<div n="lb">he sped these weapons to that same lake. Having thus once
<div n="lb">more obtained the {%Pāśupata%} weapon, {%Arjuna%} with {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">came back to their own camp (VII, {@81@}).—§ 597: THE FOUR-
<div n="lb">TEENTH DAY. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} underwent his morning rites (very
<div n="lb">copious description); {%Kṛṣṇa%} visited {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@82@}).
<div n="lb">Then also {%Virāṭa,%} etc., came (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">to rescue the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} quoting {%Nārada. Kṛṣṇa%} assured
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of {%Arjuna's%} success (VII, {@83@}). {%Arjuna%} came
<div n="lb">and acquainted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of his dream. Then he and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Yuyudhāna%} (these two in one chariot) set out to
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna's%} pavilion. {%Kṛṣṇa%} equipped {%Arjuna's%} chariot (which
<div n="lb">had previously been sanctified by {%manīras%}), which {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">circumambulated, bow and arrows in hand. {%Arjuna, Yuyu-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhāna,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} mounted the chariot. Many auspicious
<div n="lb">omens appeared. {%Arjuna%} charged {%Yuyudhāna%} to protect
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in his absence (only he or {%Pradyumna%} is able
<div n="lb">to do it). {%Yuyudhāna%} proceeded to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@84@}).
