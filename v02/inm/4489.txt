[{@Hiḍimbavadhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">killing of Hiḍimba,” the 9th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.)
<div n="lb">(cf. Hidimba). § 214 (cf. III, 553 ff.): Not far from that
[Page322-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">place dwelt on a {%śāla%} tree the {%Rākṣasa Hiḍimba,%} a cannibal
<div n="lb">with eight long and sharp-pointed teeth, etc. Scenting the
<div n="lb">odour of man, he sent his sister {%Hiḍimbā%} to slaughter them
<div n="lb">and bring them unto him. She fell in love with {%Bhīma,%} and,
<div n="lb">assuming a beautiful form, she asked him to become her
<div n="lb">husband, and promised to rescue him and his brothers and
<div n="lb">mother from her brother; but {%Bhīma%} (“neither men nor
<div n="lb">{%Gandhaṛvas,%} nor {%Yakṣas%} are able to bear my might,” v. 5960)
<div n="lb">refused to awaken them (I, {@152@}). Seeing that his sister did
<div n="lb">not return soon enough, {%Hiḍimba%} proceeded quickly to the
<div n="lb">spot, and, abusing his sister, he rushed at her, but was seized
<div n="lb">by {%Bhīma%} and dragged to a distance, lest his yells should
<div n="lb">awaken the brothers of {%Bhīma;%} fighting they broke down
<div n="lb">the trees, etc., and at those sounds the {%Pāṇḍavas%} woke up
<div n="lb">with their mother, and saw {%Hiḍimbā%} sitting before them
<div n="lb">(I, {@153@}). She made herself and her love for {%Bhīma%} known
<div n="lb">to them. {%Arjuna%} offered to assist {%Bhīma;%} but {%Bhīma%} refused.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} then said: “The morning twilight is about to set in;
<div n="lb">during the twilights {%Rākṣasas%} become stronger; kill him
<div n="lb">without delay.” Then {%Bhīma%} threw the {%Rākṣasa%} to the
<div n="lb">ground, and he, dying, sent forth a terrible yell; then he
<div n="lb">doubled up his body and broke it in the middle. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">thought there was a town not far off. Thereto they proceeded,
<div n="lb">followed by {%Hiḍimbā%} (I, {@154@}). {%Bhīma%} would also have
<div n="lb">slain {%Hiḍimbā,%} but was prevented by {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} It was
<div n="lb">agreed upon, that she should have {%Bhīma%} for her husband, until
<div n="lb">she got a son, sporting with him during the day, but bringing
<div n="lb">him back every evening. She then flew away with him, and
<div n="lb">sported with him on mountains, etc., until she had brought forth
<div n="lb">(the {%Rākṣasa%} women bring forth the very day they conceive
<div n="lb">(v. 6077) a bald-headed son, whom they, on account of his
<div n="lb">baldness, called {%Ghaṭotkaca%} ({%ghaṭo hāsyotkaca iti,%} v. 6079),
<div n="lb">who developed into a young man the very hour he was born,
<div n="lb">excelled all {%Piśācas,%} etc., in strength, and soon acquired high
<div n="lb">proficiency in all weapons. {%Hiḍimbā%} then went away; and also
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca,%} who promised that he would come when wanted
<div n="lb">for business, went away northwards. It was {%Indra%} who had
<div n="lb">created {%Ghaṭotkaca%} as an antagonist for {%Karṇa,%} in consideration
<div n="lb">of the latter's lance (I, {@155@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} proceeded from
<div n="lb">forest to forest in the garb of ascetics, studying the {%Brāhma%}
<div n="lb">{%Veda,%} and the {%Vedāṅgas,%} and the {%nītiśāstra,%} through the countries
<div n="lb">of the {%Matsyas, Trigartas, Pāñcālas,%} and {%Kīcakas.%} Then they
<div n="lb">met {%Vyāsa,%} who comforted them and led them into the town
<div n="lb">of {%Ekacakrā%} to the house of a brahman. He ordered them to
<div n="lb">wait here, till he came back, and then went away (I, {@156@}).
