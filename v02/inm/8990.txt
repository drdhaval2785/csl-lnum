{@Rāmopākhyānaparvan@}¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Rāma<sup>2</sup>,” i.e. the subject-matter of the Rāmāyaṇa; it is the
<div n="lb">48th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Rāmopākhyāna,
<div n="lb">Rāmāyaṇa.) § 525: As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}
<div n="lb">if he knew any one more unfortunate than he was (III,
<div n="lb">{@273@}), {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} related the story of {%Rāma Dāśarathi:%}
<div n="lb">King {%Aja%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race had a son {%Daśaratha,%} who had
<div n="lb">four virtuous sons: {%Rāma%} (son of {%Kausalyā%}), {%Lakṣmaṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Śatrughna%} (sons of {%Sumitrā%}), and {%Bharata%} (son of
<div n="lb">{%Kaikeyī%}). {%Sītā,%} the daughter of the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka,%}
<div n="lb">was created by {%Tvaṣṭṛ%} himself to become the wife of {%Rāma.%}
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati%} ({%Pitāmaha, Svayambhū,%} the Creator of all the
<div n="lb">worlds) had a mind-born son {%Pulastya,%} who with a cow
<div n="lb">begat a son {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e. {%Kubera%}). Leaving his father,
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśravaṇa%} went to his grandfather, and angered at this, his
<div n="lb">father with half of his own self became born as {%Viśravas%} for
<div n="lb">wreaking vengeance on {%Vaiśravaṇa.%} But {%Pitāmaha,%} pleased
<div n="lb">with {%Vaiśravaṇa,%} gave him immortality and made him the
<div n="lb">sovereign of wealth {%(Dhaneśa),%} a {%lokapāla%} and friend of {%Īśāna,%}
<div n="lb">and gave him a son {%Nalakūbara,%} and {%Laṅkā%} for his capital,
<div n="lb">guarded by hosts of {%Rākṣasas,%} and the {%vimāna Puṣpaka%}
<div n="lb">capable of going everywhere, and the kingship of the {%Yakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (III, {@274@}).—§ 526: The {%muni Viśravas%} was greatly
<div n="lb">enraged against {%Vaiśravaṇa. Kubera (Naravāhana),%} the king
<div n="lb">of the {%Rākṣasas,%} always sought to please his father, and,
<div n="lb">living in {%Laṅkā,%} sent three {%Rākṣasa%} women (<lang n="greek"></lang>) skilled in
<div n="lb">singing and dancing to wait upon him. {%Pulastya%} granted them
<div n="lb">boons: to {%Puṣpotkaṭā%} two sons: {%Kumbhakarṇa%} and {%Daśa-%}
<div n="lb">{%grīva (= Rāvaṇa); Mālinī%} bore one son, {%Vibhīṣaṇa; Rākā%}
<div n="lb">became the mother of the twins {%Khara%} and {%Śūrpaṇakhā.%}
<div n="lb">{%Vibhīṣaṇa%} surpassed everybody in beauty and was very pious;
<div n="lb">{%Daśagrīva%} was energetic and strong; {%Kumbhakarṇa%} was the
<div n="lb">most powerful in battle and a master of illusion; {%Khara%} was
<div n="lb">proficient in archery and hostile to {%brahmans; Śūrpaṇakhā%}
<div n="lb">troubled the ascetics {%(siddhavighnakarī).%} Learned in the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas,%} they lived with their father on {%Gandhamādana.%} And
<div n="lb">there they beheld {%Vaiśravaṇa%} seated with their father, and
<div n="lb">seized with jealousy, they gratified {%Brahmán%} with severe
<div n="lb">penances (<lang n="greek"></lang>), while {%Khara%} and {%Śūrpaṇakhā%} protected and
<div n="lb">attended on them. After 1,000 years {%Daśagrīva,%} cutting off
<div n="lb">his head (i.e. heads), offered it (i.e. them) in the fire, and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} appeared and made them desist from their
<div n="lb">austerities, granting them boons (<lang n="greek"></lang>) except immortality.
<div n="lb">Now {%Daśagrīva%} defeated {%Kubera%} in battle and drove him
<div n="lb">from {%Laṅkā; Kubera%} then, followed by {%Gandharvas, Yakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas,%} and {%Kinnaras,%} went to live on {%Gandhamādana.%}
<div n="lb">{%Rāvaṇa%} took from him {%Puṣpaka,%} upon which {%Vaiśravaṇa%}
<div n="lb">cursed him saying: “This chariot shall never carry thee,
<div n="lb">but him who will slay thee in battle, and as thou hast
<div n="lb">insulted thy elder brother thou shalt soon die.” {%Vibhīṣaṇa%}
<div n="lb">followed {%Kubera,%} who invested him with the command of
<div n="lb">the {%Yakṣa%} and {%Rākṣasa%} hosts. On the other hand, the
<div n="lb">man-eating {%Rākṣasas%} and {%Piśācas%} anointed {%Daśagrīva%} as their
<div n="lb">sovereign. {%Daśagrīva%} deprived the gods and {%Daityas%} of their
<div n="lb">valuable possessions, and because he terrified ({%rāvayām āsa,%}
<div n="lb">v. 15928) all creatures, he was called {%Rāvaṇa%} (III, {@275@}).
<div n="lb">The {%Brahmarṣis, Siddhas,%} and {%Devarṣis,%} with {%Agni%} as their
<div n="lb">spokesman, sought the protection of {%Brahmán,%} who said that
<div n="lb">the four-armed {%Viṣṇu%} had already been incarnate for this
<div n="lb">object, and caused {%Indra%} and the gods, {%Gandharvas,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas%} to beget strong sons, capable of assuming any
[Page593-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">form at will, on monkeys and bears; and the {%Gandharvī%}
<div n="lb">{%Dundubhī%} he caused to be born on earth as the hunch backed
<div n="lb">{%Mantharā,%} who, instructed by {%Brahmán,%} went hither and
<div n="lb">thither ever engaged in fomenting quarrels (III, {@276@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 527: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: The
<div n="lb">sons of {%Daśaratha%} were conversant with the {%Vedas%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Dhanurveda. Rāma%} equalled {%Indra%} and {%Bṛhaspati.%} At night,
<div n="lb">the {%Puṣya%} being in a lucky conjuncture, {%Rāma%} was to
<div n="lb">be invested as {%yuvarāja. Mantharā%} aroused the jealousy
<div n="lb">of {%Kaikeyī%} against {%Kausalyā, Kaikeyī%} prevailed upon
<div n="lb">{%Daśaratha%} that {%Bharata%} should be anointed and {%Rāma%} be
<div n="lb">in exile in the forest of {%Daṇḍaka%} for fourteen years. {%Rāma%}
<div n="lb">was accompanied by {%Lakṣmaṇa%} and {%Sītā. Daśaratha%} died.
<div n="lb">{%Bharata%} rebuked {%Kaikeyī%} and set off to find {%Rāma,%}
<div n="lb">accompanied by {%Kausalyā, Sumitrā, Kaikeyī, Śatrughna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha, Vāmadeva,%} etc. He saw {%Rāma%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa%}
<div n="lb">on the mountain {%Citrakūṭa,%} but {%Rāma%} would adhere to
<div n="lb">the order of his father. {%Bharata%} then ruled in Nandi-
<div n="lb">grāma, keeping before him the shoes of {%Rāma.%}—§ 528:
<div n="lb">{%Rāvaṇagamana%} (q.v.).—§ 529: {%Sītāharaṇa%} (q.v.).—§ 530:
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāvasumokṣaṇa%} (q.v.).—§ 531: Having bathed in the
<div n="lb">lake {%Pampā, Rāma%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa%} on the mountain {%Ṛṣya-%}
<div n="lb">{%mūka%} beheld the monkey-king {%Sugrīva%} (whom his brother
<div n="lb">{%Vālin%} had deprived of his wife {%Tārā%} and his kingdom) and
<div n="lb">his four counsellors, {%Hanūmat%} (equalling {%Himavat%}), etc.
<div n="lb">{%Sugrīva%} showed {%Rāma%} a piece of cloth that had been dropped
<div n="lb">by {%Sītā. Sugrīva%} promised to bring back {%Sītā. Rāma%}
<div n="lb">installed {%Sugrīva%} as king of all the monkeys and promised to
<div n="lb">slay {%Vālin.%} Then they all repaired to {%Kiṣkindhyā. Vālin%}
<div n="lb">came out; {%Tārā%} (who understood the voice of every creature)
<div n="lb">told him that it was {%Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Ṃainda, Dvivida,%}
<div n="lb">{%Hanūmat, Jāmbavat%} (the king of the bears), and {%Sugrīva%} who
<div n="lb">had come to destroy him. {%Vālin%} suspected {%Tārā.%} Near the
<div n="lb">mountain {%Mālyavat%} he had an encounter with {%Sugrīva.%}
<div n="lb">{%Hanūmat%} placed a garland round {%Sugrīva's%} neck (so that he
<div n="lb">shone like the mountain Malaya), and {%Rāma%} recognized
<div n="lb">{%Sugrīva%} by that sign and killed {%Vālin%} with an arrow. {%Sugrīva%}
<div n="lb">thus regained {%Kiṣkindhyā%} and {%Tārā. Rāma%} dwelt on
<div n="lb">Mālyavat for four months.—§ 532: {%Sītāsāntvana%} (q.v.).—
