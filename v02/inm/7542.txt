[{@Nalopākhyānaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Nala,” the 35th of the minor parvans of the Mahābhāraṭa;
<div n="lb">cf. Nalopākhyāna).—§ 343: One day, when the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">were grieving for {%Arjuna, Bhīma%} asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
<div n="lb">permit him to go and slay {%Duryodhana,%} interpreting the
<div n="lb">time to be complete (“as in the {%Veda%} a day is often
<div n="lb">equivalent to a year, when passed in suffering”) {%(kṛcchrataḥ),%}
<div n="lb">but he did not prevail upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} While they were
<div n="lb">conversing the great {%ṛṣi Bṛhadaśva%} came before them, and,
<div n="lb">asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if there was on earth a king more
<div n="lb">unfortunate than himself, he said that he would narrate a
<div n="lb">history of a prince more miserable than {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} viz.
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} (the son of the {%Niṣadha%} king {%Vīrasena%}), who, defeated
<div n="lb">deceitfully by {%Puṣkara%} (the brother of {%Nala,%} v. 2296),
<div n="lb">dwelt in the woods with his spouse, having neither slaves
<div n="lb">nor chariots nor brothers nor friends with him (III, {@52@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 344: {%Bṛhadaśva%} said: The {%Niṣadha%} king {%Nala,%} the son
<div n="lb">of {%Vīrasena,%} was above all kings, etc., and fond of dice.
[Page500-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">The {%Vidarbha%} king {%Bhīma%} was granted by the {%Brahmarṣi%}
<div n="lb">{%Damana%} a daughter, {%Damayantī,%} and three excellent sons,
<div n="lb">{%Dama, Dānta,%} and {%Damana.%} Both {%Nala%} and {%Damayantī%} had
<div n="lb">not their equals in beauty, and, continually hearing of each
<div n="lb">other's virtues, they conceived attachment to each other,
<div n="lb">though they had never seen each other. Once {%Nala%} in
<div n="lb">his garden saw a number of golden-winged swans and
<div n="lb">caught one of them, but let it loose, as it promised to
<div n="lb">speak well of him before {%Damayantī.%} The swans having
<div n="lb">arrived at the {%Vidarbha%} country, the one who had been
<div n="lb">caught by {%Nala%} led {%Damayantī%} to a secluded spot and
<div n="lb">fulfilled its mission. {%Damayantī%} caused it to speak to {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">of her (III, {@53@}).—§ 345: As {%Damayantī%} became sick of
<div n="lb">love, her father invited all the kings to her {%svayaṃvara.%}
<div n="lb">At this time the {%ṛṣis%} of the gods {%Nārada%} and {%Parvata,%}
<div n="lb">having arrived in course of their wanderings at the regions
<div n="lb">of {%Indra,%} told him that the kings did not now come to him
<div n="lb">because they were intent on the {%svayaṃvara%} of {%Damayantī.%}
<div n="lb">Hearing this, the {%Lokapālas%} set out on their vehicles for
<div n="lb">the {%svayaṃvara,%} but seeing {%Nala%} on the way and filled with
<div n="lb">astonishment at his beauty, they left their chariots in the
<div n="lb">sky and asked {%Nala%} to be their messenger (III, {@54@}).
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} promised to do so, but when {%Indra%} told him to go to
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} and tell her that {%Indra, Agni, Varuṇa,%} and {%Yama%}
<div n="lb">desired her to choose one of them for her lord, he asked
<div n="lb">them to spare him as he had come with the same object;
<div n="lb">but, as they insisted that he should stand by his promise,
<div n="lb">he by their power entered without being perceived by the
<div n="lb">guardians into the apartments of {%Damayantī,%} and, saying
<div n="lb">his name, fulfilled his mission (III, {@55@}). {%Damayantī%}
<div n="lb">declared that if she did not become the wife of {%Nala%} himself
<div n="lb">she would resort to poison, or fire, or water, or the rope.
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} advised her to choose one of the gods, maintaining
<div n="lb">that having come in a different mission he dared not seek his
<div n="lb">own interest. {%Damayantī%} then told him to come to her
<div n="lb">{%svayaṃvara%} in company with the gods, then she would
<div n="lb">choose him, at which no blame would be his, and {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">returned to the {%Lokapālas%} and told them what had happened
<div n="lb">(III, {@56@}). At the sacred hour of the holy lunar day of
<div n="lb">the auspicious season {%Bhīma%} summoned the kings to the
<div n="lb">{%svayaṃvara,%} and that assembly of kings resembled the
<div n="lb">{%Bhogavatī%} swarming with {%Nāgas. Damayantī,%} beholding five
<div n="lb">persons all alike in appearance, and recollecting the marks
<div n="lb">of the celestials, of which she had heard from old people,
<div n="lb">was unable to distinguish which of them was {%Nala.%} Filled
<div n="lb">with grief, she then decided upon seeking the protection
<div n="lb">of the gods themselves, and prevailed upon them that they
<div n="lb">assumed their true shapes. Thereupon she beheld the
<div n="lb">gods unmoistened with perspiration, with unwinking eyes and
<div n="lb">unfading garlands, not stained with dust, and staying without
<div n="lb">touching the ground, while {%Nala%} was revealed by his shadow,
<div n="lb">his fading garlands, and by his being stained with dust and
<div n="lb">sweat, and resting on the ground with winking eyes. She
<div n="lb">then chose {%Nala,%} seizing the hem of his garment and placing
<div n="lb">a floral wreath round his neck. {%Nala%} promised {%Damayantī%}
<div n="lb">that he would remain hers as long as he lived, and she
<div n="lb">spoke words of like import to him. The {%Lokapālas%} bestowed
<div n="lb">each a couple of boons on {%Nala: Indra,%} that he should be
<div n="lb">able to behold his divine nature in sacrifices, and blessed
<div n="lb">regions thereafter {%(gatim anuttamāṃ); Agni,%} his own presence
<div n="lb">wherever he wished and regions as bright as himself; {%Yama,%}
<div n="lb">subtle taste in food and pre-eminence in virtue; {%Varuṇa,%}
<div n="lb">water wherever he desired and garlands of celestial fragrance.
[Page500-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">Then the gods went to heaven and the kings returned
<div n="lb">home. {%Nala,%} after the wedding, stayed there for a time,
<div n="lb">returned home, ruled righteously, and celebrated the horse-
<div n="lb">sacrifice, etc. He begat the son {%Indrasena%} and the daughter
<div n="lb">{%Indrasenā%} upon {%Damayantī%} (III, {@57@}).—§ 346: When the
<div n="lb">{%Lokapālas%} were returning they met {%Dvāpara%} with {%Kali%} going
<div n="lb">to the {%svayaṃvara,%} and {%Indra%} told {%Kali%} that {%Damayantī%} had
<div n="lb">already chosen {%Nala.%} As {%Kali%} threatened to avenge himself
<div n="lb">he was rebuked by the {%Lokapālas,%} as {%Nala%} had studied the
<div n="lb">four {%Vedas%} with the {%Ākhyāna%} as the fifth, etc. When the gods
<div n="lb">had gone to heaven, {%Kali%} said that he would take possession
<div n="lb">of {%Nala%} and deprive him of his kingdom, and asked {%Dvāpara%}
<div n="lb">to enter the dice (III, {@58@}). {%Kali%} then went to the country
<div n="lb">of the {%Niṣadhas%} and always watched for an opportunity.
<div n="lb">At last, in the twelfth year, when {%Nala,%} after answering
<div n="lb">a call of nature, touching water had said his twilight prayers
<div n="lb">without having washed his feet, {%Kali%} entered his person.
<div n="lb">Then {%Kali%} becoming {%Vṛṣa%} ({%“vṛṣo gavāṃ,”%} the principal die,
<div n="lb">Nīl.) (PCR. thinks we ought to read that “{%Dvāpara%} also
<div n="lb">approached {%Puṣkara%} becoming {%Vṛṣa%}”) prevailed upon
<div n="lb">{%Puṣkara,%} that he challenged {%Nala%} to a match of dice in
<div n="lb">order to acquire his kingdom. {%Nala%} and {%Puṣkara%} gambled
<div n="lb">together for many months, {%Nala%} being always worsted; no
<div n="lb">one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading him
<div n="lb">from the play; at last they came in a body, which was
<div n="lb">told by the {%sūta%} to {%Damayantī,%} who in vain represented
<div n="lb">it to {%Nala;%} he uttered not a word in reply (III, {@59@}).
<div n="lb">Seeing that {%Nala%} had lost everything, {%Damayantī%} told her
<div n="lb">nurse and maidservant {%Bṛhatsenā%} to summon the councillors
<div n="lb">in the name of {%Nala%} and tell them what had been lost;
<div n="lb">the councillors approached {%Nala,%} and {%Damayantī%} informed
<div n="lb">him that the citizens had come again in a body, but he
<div n="lb">regarded her not. She then caused {%Bṛhatsenā%} to summon
<div n="lb">the {%sūta Vārṣṇeya,%} who at her request yoked {%Nala's%}
<div n="lb">favourite horses and brought her two children to {%Kuṇḍina%}
<div n="lb">(the city of {%Bhīma,%} Nīl.). There he left the children, the
<div n="lb">chariot, and the horses, and went to {%Ayodhyā,%} where he
<div n="lb">entered the service of king {%Ṛtuparṇa%} (the king of {%Kośala,%}
<div n="lb">v. 2877) as a charioteer (III, {@60@}).—§ 347: At last, when
<div n="lb">{%Puṣkara%} had won all {%Nala's%} wealth and his kingdom, he
<div n="lb">proposed to him to stake {%Damayantī.%} But {%Nala,%} feeling
<div n="lb">as if his heart would burst and gazing at {%Puṣkara%} in
<div n="lb">anguish without speaking a word, took all the ornaments
<div n="lb">off his body, and attired in a single piece of cloth left the
<div n="lb">city accompanied by {%Damayantī.%} They stayed for three
<div n="lb">nights in the outskirts of the city, living on water alone.
<div n="lb">Nobody showed him hospitable regards, as {%Puṣkara%} had
<div n="lb">proclaimed through the city that he that should show any
<div n="lb">attention to {%Nala%} would be put to death. After many days
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} saw some birds of golden hue and covered them with
<div n="lb">his cloth in order to catch them, but they rose up to the
<div n="lb">sky taking away that garment of his, and then told him
<div n="lb">they were the dice that had come hither to take away
<div n="lb">even his cloth. {%Nala%} proposed to {%Damayantī%} to leave
<div n="lb">him, pointing out to her the roads to {%Avantī, Ṛkṣavat,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vindhya, Payoṣnī, Vidarbha, Kośala%} (C. {%Kośalāṃ,%} B. and
<div n="lb">Bopp {%Kośalān%}), and the south. But she would not leave
<div n="lb">him, but suggested that they should go to {%Vidarbha%} (III, {@61@}).
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} refused to appear before {%Bhīma%} in his state of misery.
<div n="lb">They went on attired in the same piece of cloth. Once
<div n="lb">when {%Damayantī%} had fallen into a profound slumber in
<div n="lb">a shed for travellers {%(sabhā), Nala,%} influenced by {%Kali,%}
<div n="lb">resolved upon deserting {%Damayantī,%} as separated from him
[Page501-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">she might perchance wander to her relatives. With a sword
<div n="lb">that he found near the shed he cut off one half of the
<div n="lb">cloth and throwing the instrument away departed, having
<div n="lb">first returned again and again, dragged away by {%Kali,%} but
<div n="lb">drawn back by love (III, {@62@}). When {%Damayantī%} awoke,
<div n="lb">she lamented and cursed the being through whose imprecation
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} suffered woe, saying that it should lead a still more
<div n="lb">miserable life. Thereupon, wandering on, she was seized
<div n="lb">by a gigantic serpent and rescued by a hunter; as the
<div n="lb">hunter, after comforting her, tried to force her to love
<div n="lb">him, he was cursed by her and fell down lifeless upon the
<div n="lb">ground (III, {@63@}). Description of the forest, {%Damayantī's%}
<div n="lb">lamentations. She went in a northerly direction for three
<div n="lb">days and nights, then she came to an asylum of ascetics,
<div n="lb">who told her that she should again become happy together
<div n="lb">with {%Nala.%} Then the asylum disappeared. Sometime after-
<div n="lb">wards, having proceeded a long way, she met with a body of
<div n="lb">merchants landing on the banks of a river; its leader was {%Śuci%}
<div n="lb">(v. 2529, “so help us now, {%Maṇibhadra,%} the king of {%Yakṣas%}”),
<div n="lb">and it was bound for the city of the {%Cedi%} king {%Subāhu%} (III,
<div n="lb">{@64@}). {%Damayantī%} followed the caravan. Once, at midnight,
<div n="lb">the caravan was destroyed by wild elephants and many men
<div n="lb">were trodden to death, which some ascribed to their not
<div n="lb">having worshipped {%Maṇibhadra%} or {%Vaiśvavaṇa,%} the kings of
<div n="lb">{%Yakṣas,%} others to their having received {%Damayantī,%} whom
<div n="lb">they thought to be a {%Rākṣasa%} or {%Piśāca%} or {%Yakṣa%} woman,
<div n="lb">and resolved upon killing her when they saw her. Hearing
<div n="lb">this {%Damayantī%} fled. The next day the remnant of the
<div n="lb">caravan left the place. {%Damayantī,%} with the brahmans that
<div n="lb">had survived the slaughter of the caravan, came towards
<div n="lb">evening to the city of the {%Cedi%} king {%Subāhu.%} The boys
<div n="lb">began to follow her; when she came before the palace of
<div n="lb">the king, the queen-mother let the nurse take her in.
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} agreed to stay there on the conditions that she
<div n="lb">should not eat remnants, not wash anyone's feet, nor speak
<div n="lb">with other men, but be protected against all aspirations.
<div n="lb">The queen gave her as a {%sairindhrī%} to her daughter {%Sunandā%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@65@}).—§ 348: {%Nala,%} having deserted {%Damayantī,%} saw
<div n="lb">a conflagration in the forest and therefrom heard a voice
<div n="lb">calling him by name and saw the {%Nāga Karkoṭaka,%} who
<div n="lb">unable to stir, told him that he had deceived the great
<div n="lb">ṛṣi {%Nārada%} and been cursed by him with the words: “Stay
<div n="lb">thou here immobile until {%Nala%} takes thee hence, then
<div n="lb">thou shalt be freed from my curse,” and asked him to deliver
<div n="lb">him and promised to instruct him in respect of his welfare.
<div n="lb">The snake then became as small as a thumb, and {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">taking him up went to a spot free from fire. {%Karkoṭaka%}
<div n="lb">let him proceed yet counting his steps, and bit him at the
<div n="lb">tenth step {%(adaśad daśame pade)%} (see Nīl. and PCR.). Then
<div n="lb">the form of {%Nala%} was changed, in order that people might
<div n="lb">not recognize him, and {%Karkoṭaka%} assumed his own form,
<div n="lb">and said that {%Kali%} dwelling in {%Nala%} should be tortured
<div n="lb">by his venom, and that {%Nala%} should have no fear from
<div n="lb">animals with fangs, from enemies, and from men versed in
<div n="lb">the Veda {%(brahmavidbhyaḥ),%} and told him to go to {%Ayodhyā%}
<div n="lb">and present himself as a {%sūta Bāhuka%} before {%Ṛtuparṇa%} (of the
<div n="lb">race of {%Ikṣvāku%}), who would give {%Nala%} his skill in dice
<div n="lb">{%(akṣahṛdaya)%} in exchange for {%Nala's%} knowledge of horses
<div n="lb">{%(aśvahṛdaya),%} and when he had become an adept at dice he
<div n="lb">should have prosperity and meet with his wife and children
<div n="lb">and regain his kingdom. The {%Nāga%} king then gave {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">two pieces of celestial cloth, saying that when he desired to
<div n="lb">get back his own form he should remember him and wear
[Page501-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">this garment. Then he disappeared (III, {@66@}).—§ 349:
<div n="lb">On the tenth day {%Nala%} entered the city of {%Ṛtuparṇa;%} he
<div n="lb">approached the king and named himself {%Bāhuka,%} and said
<div n="lb">that he surpassed everybody in managing steeds and might be
<div n="lb">consulted in matters of difficulty {%(arthakṛcchreṣu)%} and affairs
<div n="lb">of skill {%(naipuṇeṣu),%} and that he was versed in the art
<div n="lb">of cooking. Then he was appointed superintendent of
<div n="lb">{%Ṛtuparṇa's%} horses on a pay of 10,000, and {%Vārṣṇeya%}
<div n="lb">and {%Jīvala%} should be under his direction. Every evening
<div n="lb">he recited the śloka, “Where lies that helpless one
<div n="lb">{%(tapasvinī)%} afflicted with hunger and thirst and worn
<div n="lb">with toil {%(śrāntā),%} or upon whom does she now wait
<div n="lb">{%(upatiṣṭhati)?%}” Once {%Jīvala%} asked him who she was, and
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} related to him the main features of his story without
<div n="lb">naming her or himself (III, {@67@}).—§ 350: {%Bhīma%} sent
<div n="lb">out brahmans in all directions to search for {%Nala%} and
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī,%} promising 1,000 kine, etc., to him that should
<div n="lb">find them. At length the brahman {%Sudeva,%} the friend of
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī's%} brother, recognized {%Damayantī%} in the city of
<div n="lb">the {%Cedis,%} seated with {%Sunandā%} during the time of the
<div n="lb">king's prayers {%(puṇyāhavācane rājñaḥ),%} and told her who
<div n="lb">he was and that her relatives and children were well.
<div n="lb">Beholding {%Damayantī%} weeping and conversing in private
<div n="lb">with {%Sudeva, Sunandā%} caused her mother to question {%Sudeva%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@68@}). {%Sudeva%} told the story of {%Damayantī,%} and that he
<div n="lb">had recognized her by a mole between her eyebrows, which
<div n="lb">was now almost covered with dust as her whole body.
<div n="lb">Then {%Sunandā%} washed away the dust and the queen-mother
<div n="lb">recognized her by the mole as the daughter of her sister,
<div n="lb">as she and {%Damayantī's%} mother were both daughters of the
<div n="lb">{%Daśārṇa%} king {%Sudāman,%} and she herself had been bestowed
<div n="lb">on {%Vīrabāhu%} and her sister on {%Bhīma;%} she had witnessed
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī's%} birth in the palace of her father in the Daśārṇa
<div n="lb">country. At her own request {%Damayantī%} was brought in
<div n="lb">a litter carried by men and protected by a large escort to
<div n="lb">the city of {%Bhīma,%} and was received with respect and
<div n="lb">worshipped the gods and brahmans. {%Bhīma%} gave unto
<div n="lb">{%Sudeva%} 1,000 kine, etc. The next day {%Damayantī%} let her
<div n="lb">mother cause {%Bhīma%} to send brahmans out in all directions
<div n="lb">to seek for {%Nala. Damayantī%} ordered them everywhere
<div n="lb">to recite the {%ślokas:%} “O beloved gambler, where hast
<div n="lb">thou gone, cutting off half of my garment,” etc., but to
<div n="lb">take care that no one knew that it was on her command
<div n="lb">(III, {@69@}).—§ 351: After a long time the brahman
<div n="lb">{%Parṇāda%} told that he had in {%Ayodhyā%} visited {%Bhāṅgāsuri%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Ṛtuparṇa%}), and that {%Bāhuka%} had been affected by
<div n="lb">hearing his {%śloka,%} and had said to him: “Chaste women,
<div n="lb">though overtaken by calamity, yet protect themselves,” etc.
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} then thanked {%Parṇāda%} and promised him great
<div n="lb">wealth and consulted with her mother, and, without {%Bhīma's%}
<div n="lb">knowing it, sent {%Sudeva,%} who told {%Ṛtuparṇa%} that to-morrow
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} would hold another {%svayaṃvara%} (III, {@70@}).
<div n="lb">When ordered by {%Ṛtuparṇa%} to conduct him to the {%svayaṃvara%}
<div n="lb">of {%Damayantī, Bāhuka%} felt his heart bursting with grief, but
<div n="lb">promised to go there in a single day; he yoked four horses
<div n="lb">born in {%Sindhu%} (description of their marks), made {%Vārṣṇeya%}
<div n="lb">sit on the chariot, and set out with so great speed that
<div n="lb">{%Vārṣṇeya%} thought he must be {%Mātali%} or {%Śālihotra,%} who
<div n="lb">had taken a human shape, or {%Nala%} (III, {@71@}).—§ 352:
<div n="lb">As the chariot was coursing thus, {%Ṛtuparṇa%} lost his upper
<div n="lb">garment, and {%Nala%} declared that it was impossible to
<div n="lb">recover it, as they had already travelled one {%yojana%} thence.
<div n="lb">As {%Ṛtuparṇa%} rightly indicated the number of fruits of
[Page502-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">a {%vibhītaka-%}tree {%(Terminalia bellerica),%} and said he was skilled
<div n="lb">in dice as in numbers, {%Nala%} prevailed upon him to teach him
<div n="lb">the science and in future receive instead his science of
<div n="lb">horses. Then {%Kali%} came out from the body of {%Nala,%} vomiting
<div n="lb">the poison of {%Karkoṭaka,%} and assumed his own shape, as
<div n="lb">the fire of {%Damayantī's%} curse had left him, but remained
<div n="lb">invisible to others except {%Nala. Kali%} prevailed upon {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">that he should not curse him, promising that those men
<div n="lb">who would attentively recite his history should be free
<div n="lb">from fear of him, and entered the {%vibhītaka-%}tree till {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">had gone far away. Then {%Kali%} returned to his abode.
<div n="lb">From the touch of {%Kali%} the {%vibhītaka-%}tree from that hour
<div n="lb">fell into disrepute. {%Nala%} now became free from calamity,
<div n="lb">though he did not assume his original form (III, {@72@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 353: At night they arrived at {%Kuṇḍina,%} having passed
<div n="lb">100 {%yojanas.%} The steeds of {%Nala%} that were in that city,
<div n="lb">and peacocks and elephants and {%Damayantī%} recognized the
<div n="lb">sound of {%Nala's%} chariot; {%Damayantī%} ascended the terrace
<div n="lb">with the desire of seeing {%Nala.%} The {%Kośala%} king {%(Ṛtuparṇa)%}
<div n="lb">wondered, as he did not hear any talk of the {%svayaṃvara,%}
<div n="lb">etc., and {%Bhīma%} thought that he had come simply to pay
<div n="lb">his respects. When {%Ṛtuparṇa%} had gone to his appointed
<div n="lb">quarters with {%Vārṣṇeya,%} and {%Bāhuka,%} having tended the
<div n="lb">horses, was sitting at the side of the chariot, {%Damayantī%}
<div n="lb">sent a female messenger in search of {%Nala%} (III, {@73@}). The
<div n="lb">female messenger {%Keśinī%} asked {%Bāhuka%} about {%Vārṣṇeya%}
<div n="lb">and himself; he said that {%Vārṣṇeya%} was the charioteer of
<div n="lb">{%Nala,%} that nobody knew {%Nala%} except {%Nala%} himself and
<div n="lb">his wife, as he did not discover his marks of identity
<div n="lb">anywhere, and that he himself was the charioteer and
<div n="lb">cook of king {%Ṛtuparṇa;%} at last she repeated the {%śloka%} of
<div n="lb">{%Parṇāda:%} “O beloved gambler,” etc., and said that
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} wished again to hear the reply he had given
<div n="lb">{%Parṇāda;%} then {%Bāhuka,%} weeping, said: “Chaste women,
<div n="lb">though overtaken by calamity,” etc., and {%Keśinī%} went to
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} and acquainted her with everything (III, {@74@}).
<div n="lb">{%Damayantī%} again sent {%Keśinī%} to stay in silence at {%Bāhuka's%}
<div n="lb">side and mark his conduct; she related that low passages
<div n="lb">grew in height so that he might pass through them easily,
<div n="lb">that when he approached narrow holes opened wide, that
<div n="lb">only by his looking upon them the vessels became filled
<div n="lb">with water, that when he held a handful of grass in the sun
<div n="lb">the fire blazed up all of a sudden, that he touched fire
<div n="lb">and was not hurt, that water falling at his will flowed
<div n="lb">in a stream, and that flowers pressed with his hands became
<div n="lb">gayer and more fragrant than before. {%Damayantī%} then caused
<div n="lb">{%Keśinī%} without {%Bāhuka's%} knowledge to bring her some meat
<div n="lb">that had been boiled and dressed by him, from the kitchen,
<div n="lb">and recognized the taste. She then sent her two children
<div n="lb">with {%Keśinī. Bāhuka%} embraced them crying aloud, saying
<div n="lb">they were like his own children, and sent {%Keśinī%} away lest
<div n="lb">people might think “evil” (III, {@75@}). Having obtained
<div n="lb">the consent both of her father and mother, {%Damayantī%}
<div n="lb">caused {%Nala%} to be brought to her apartments; it came to
<div n="lb">an explication; {%Damayantī%} declared that she had feigned
<div n="lb">to hold a second {%svayaṃvara%} because no one except {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">could in one day manage 100 {%yojanas%} with horses, and swore
<div n="lb">by the Air, Sun, and Moon (“who dwells as a witness within
<div n="lb">every creature,” v. 2989), who had been her protector for
<div n="lb">these three years, and {%Vāyu%} bore witness to the truth of
<div n="lb">her words. Then a floral shower fell there, and the celestial
<div n="lb">kettledrum began to play. {%Nala%} then wore the garment
<div n="lb">he had received from the serpent king and regained his
[Page502-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">old form. Thus {%Nala%} in the fourth year was reunited
<div n="lb">with his wife (III, {@76@}). The next day they presented
<div n="lb">themselves before {%Bhīma.%} The citizens were in great joy
<div n="lb">and adorned {%(arcitāni)%} the temples {%(devatāyatanāni),%} etc.
<div n="lb">{%Ṛtuparṇa%} asked {%Nala's%} forgiveness, and {%Nala%} also asked
<div n="lb">{%Ṛtuparṇa's%} forgiveness, and made over to him his horse-
<div n="lb">lore, having obtained from him the mystery of dice. Then
<div n="lb">{%Ṛtuparṇa%} went away to his own city, employing another
<div n="lb">person as his charioteer (III, {@77@}).—§ 354: Having dwelt
<div n="lb">for a month at {%Kuṇḍina, Nala%} set out for the {%Niṣadha%}
<div n="lb">country with a single white chariot, sixteen elephants, fifty
<div n="lb">horses, and 600 infantry, and proposed to {%Puṣkara%} that
<div n="lb">they should gamble again, as {%Nala%} had won great wealth;
<div n="lb">the stake should be {%Damayantī,%} wealth and kingdom,
<div n="lb">and their lives; if not, he proposed a single combat.
<div n="lb">{%Puṣkara,%} hoping to win {%Damayantī,%} whom he loved,
<div n="lb">gladly consented to gamble, and lost at a single throw.
<div n="lb">{%Nala,%} declaring that it was {%Kali%} who had done it all,
<div n="lb">forgave his brother and granted him his portion, and after
<div n="lb">a month let him go to his own town. All the citizens
<div n="lb">and subjects rejoiced at {%Nala's%} return (III, {@78@}). Then {%Nala%}
<div n="lb">with a large force brought {%Damayantī%} and his children home,
<div n="lb">and passed his days in joy and performed numerous sacrifices
<div n="lb">with abundant gifts to brahmans.—§ 355: “So thou also,
<div n="lb">O {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} wilt blaze forth in effulgence soon. They
<div n="lb">that will repeatedly recite this history of {%Nala%} and they
<div n="lb">that will hear it recited will never be touched by adversity.”
<div n="lb">As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} feared that some one skilled in dice
<div n="lb">might summon him, {%Bṛhadaśva%} taught him the science of
<div n="lb">dice {%(akṣahṛdaya)%} and then went to {%Aśvaśiras%} for a bathe.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then learnt from brahmans and ascetics from
<div n="lb">various directions that {%Arjuna%} was still engaged in ascetic
<div n="lb">penances, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} grieved for him (III, {@79@}).
