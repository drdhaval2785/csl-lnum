[{@Śrī-Vāsava-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the discourse between Śrī
<div n="lb">and Indra”). § 674{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">who through his penance beholds both this and the other
<div n="lb">world at once, etc., wandered through the three worlds.
<div n="lb">Once at dawn he performed his ablutions in the {%Gaṅgā%}
[Page216-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%(Dhruvadvārabhavāṃ),%} and so did {%Indra.%} They listened to the
<div n="lb">narratives told by the great D.—ṛ. They hymned the rising
<div n="lb">Sun, and then in the opposite direction beheld a luminous
<div n="lb">object riding on {%Viṣṇu's%} vehicle adorned with {%Garuḍa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Sūrya;%} it was {%Śrī%} with many Aps. (description); her names:
<div n="lb">{%Padmā,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). She said that they had formerly dwelt with
<div n="lb">the {%Asuras%} in consequence of her disposition to be bound
<div n="lb">by truth and merit; seeing, however, that the {%Asuras%} had
<div n="lb">assumed perverse natures, she had left them and wished to
<div n="lb">reside with {%Indra.%} Requested by {%Indra,%} she told that she
<div n="lb">had dwelt with the {%Asuras%} on account of their good
<div n="lb">behaviour, but after they had fallen off from virtue, she had
<div n="lb">deserted Dai. and Dā. and had come to {%Indra;%} “there where
<div n="lb">I reside, the seven other goddesses (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and {%Jayā%} as the
<div n="lb">eighth, who love me, etc., desire to live; all of them and
<div n="lb">myself, having deserted As., have come to thee.” D.—ṛ.,
<div n="lb">{%Nārada,%} and {%Indra%} gave her a hearty welcome. {%Vāyu,%} the
<div n="lb">friend of {%Agni,%} began to blow gently; all the deities assembled;
<div n="lb">heaven began to shower nectar upon the region of {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">etc.; {%Indra%} began to pour rain; no one deviated from the
<div n="lb">path of righteousness, etc.; D., K., Y., Ra. became cheerful,
<div n="lb">etc. (XII, {@229@}).
