{@[Putradarśanaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">seeing of the sons,” the 96th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
<div n="lb">cf. Putradarśana). § 789: {%Janamejaya%} said: Tell me what
<div n="lb">that wonderful feat was which M.-ṛ. {%Vyāsa%} accomplished after
<div n="lb">his promise to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} when he had taken up his abode
<div n="lb">in the forest with {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī,%} and after {%Vidura%} had
<div n="lb">left his body and entered into {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and when all the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} were in the ascetic retreat; for how many days did
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} stay with his men in the woods; on what food
<div n="lb">did the {%Pāṇḍavas%} support themselves with their men and wives?
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} passed about a month in
<div n="lb">that forest, supporting themselves on diverse kinds of food
<div n="lb">and drink. Then {%Vyāsa%} came there and {%Nārada,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">they sat down on sacred seats [of {%kuśa%} grass] and on seats of
<div n="lb">peacock feathers; {%Gāndhārī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) also sat down; they
<div n="lb">spoke of Ṛ., D., and As. Then {%Vyāsa%} said that he knew that
<div n="lb">burning grief in the heart of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “let
<div n="lb">D., G., and M.-ṛ. to-day behold the energy of my penances;
<div n="lb">therefore tell me what wish of thine I shall grant to-day.”
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wished to see his dead children and kinsmen,
<div n="lb">mentioning {%Duryodhana%} and the slaughter of {%Bhīṣma%} and
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa.%} Hearing this the grief of {%Gāndhārī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) became
<div n="lb">fresh; {%Gāndhārī%} said that for sixteen years {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} never
<div n="lb">had slept for grief; and also {%Kṛṣṇā,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) grieved
<div n="lb">exceedingly. {%Vyāsa%} then asked {%Kuntī%} to tell what she
<div n="lb">wished (XV, {@29@}). {%Kuntī%} told the story of {%Karṇa's%} birth
<div n="lb">(mentioning {%Durvāsas,%} etc.); {%Vyāsa%} promised to show her
[Page573-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} and said that she had no fault in what had happened
<div n="lb">about the birth of {%Karṇa;%} “the gods beget after five methods
<div n="lb">(thought, word, sight, touch, and sexual union)” (XV, {@30@})
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} promised to show everyone the persons whom they
<div n="lb">wished to see and who were in the other world (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “they were
<div n="lb">all portions of D.; both G., Aps., Pś., Gh., Rā., {%Puṇyajanāḥ,%}
<div n="lb">Si., D.-ṛ., D., and Dā. met with death on the battlefield of
<div n="lb">{%Kurukṣetra%}”; he explained who among the dead, etc., was
<div n="lb">what: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was the {%Gandharva%} king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). They all, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with his ministers and the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and Ṛ. and G., proceeded towards the Bhāgīrathī
<div n="lb">and waited for the advent of night; at sunset they bathed
<div n="lb">and finished their evening rites (XV, {@31@}). When night
<div n="lb">came, {%Vyāsa%} plunged into the Bhāgīrathī for a bath, and
<div n="lb">summoned all the deceased warriors, who all rose up from
<div n="lb">the water with a loud uproar, everyone presenting the same
<div n="lb">aspect that he did when clad for battle; there were {%Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); all of them were now robed in celestial vestments
<div n="lb">and had brilliant earrings; they were free from all animosity,
<div n="lb">etc.; G. sang their praises, etc.; each of them was waited
<div n="lb">upon by bands of Aps. {%Vyāsa%} gave {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} celestial
<div n="lb">vision; endued with celestial knowledge, {%Gāndhārī%} saw all
<div n="lb">the slain; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became full of joy (XV, {@32@}).
<div n="lb">Divested of wrath and malice, the spirits of the dead mingled
<div n="lb">with the living in happy converse (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Having sported with
<div n="lb">one another for that night they, taking leave from each other,
<div n="lb">returned to the places they had come from (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">dismissing them within the twinkling of an eye; of Rā. and
<div n="lb">Pś. some proceeded to the {%Uttarakurus,%} others to the gods.
<div n="lb">With {%Vyāsa's%} permission, many widows plunged into the
<div n="lb">waters of the Bhāgīrathī in order to accompany their deceased
<div n="lb">lords, and proceeded to those regions where their husbands
<div n="lb">had found their abodes. {%Vyāsa%} granted to all the men there
<div n="lb">assembled the fruition of their wishes. People of diverse
<div n="lb">realms, hearing of this meeting between the dead and living,
<div n="lb">became highly delighted (XV, {@33@}).—§ 790: {%Sauti%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} filled with joy asked {%Vaiśampāyana,%} how it is
<div n="lb">possible for persons whose bodies have been destroyed to
<div n="lb">reappear in those very forms. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Acts are
<div n="lb">never destroyed; bodies are born of acts; so also are features,
<div n="lb">etc., quoting a {%śruti%} in the horse-sacrifice (XV, {@34@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had never beheld his own sons, but got spiritual
<div n="lb">vision from {%Vyāsa,%} he had learnt all the royal duties, as also
<div n="lb">the {%Vedas%} and {%Upaniṣads; Vidura%} attained to high success
<div n="lb">through penances. {%Janamejaya%} said: If {%Vyāsa%} shows me my
<div n="lb">father as he was when he died I may then believe all that thou
<div n="lb">hast told me. {%Sauti%} said: Then {%Vyāsa%} brought {%Parikṣit%}
<div n="lb">[from the other world], and {%Śamīka%} and his son {%Śṛṅgin;%}
<div n="lb">all the counsellors and ministers of the king beheld them.
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya,%} performing the final bath in his sacrifice, highly
<div n="lb">rejoiced; he poured the sacred water over his father, as also
<div n="lb">over himself; then he said to {%Āstīka%} that this his sacrifice was
<div n="lb">fraught with many wonderful incidents; {%Āstīka%} praised
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} and the snake-sacrifice, from which {%Takṣaka%} had with
<div n="lb">difficulty escaped, the worship of Ṛ., etc. {%Janamejaya%}
<div n="lb">honoured {%Āstīka,%} and then asked Ṛ. {%Vaiśampāyana%} about
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} further residence in the woods (XV, {@35@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 791: {%Janamejaya%} said: Having seen his sons, etc., what
<div n="lb">did {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and king {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} also, do? {%Vaiśampā-%}
<div n="lb">{%yana%} said: Beholding that wonderful sight, the reappearance
<div n="lb">of his children, R.-ṛ. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became relieved of his
<div n="lb">grief and returned to his retreat; the people and Ṛ., dismissed
<div n="lb">by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} returned home. {%Vyāsa%} came and asked
[Page573-b+ 59]
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to dismiss the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (“thou hast heard
<div n="lb">discourses from Ṛ., the mysteries of D. from {%Nārada,%} etc.”),
<div n="lb">who now had passed more than a month in the woods.
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} affectionately, and
<div n="lb">dismissed him and his brothers. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} offered to
<div n="lb">wait upon his uncle and his two mothers; {%Gāndhārī%} dissuaded
<div n="lb">him from that step. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that his mind was
<div n="lb">wholly set upon penances, as the whole earth were empty now,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) {%Sahadeva,%} saying that he dared not leave his mother,
<div n="lb">urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to return to the capital; he would
<div n="lb">himself remain, engaged in penances and in serving the old
<div n="lb">king and his mothers. {%Kuntī%} affectionately dissuaded her
<div n="lb">sons from remaining with her and thereby obstructing her
<div n="lb">penances. They then took leave of their mother and
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} who blessed and comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), and embraced them one after another. Then {%Gāndhārī%}
<div n="lb">blessed them, and {%Kuntī%} kissed them on their heads, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī%} embraced {%Draupadī,%} etc., and instructed
<div n="lb">them. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his wives and troops and kinsmen
<div n="lb">set out for {%Hāstinapura%} (XV, {@36@}).
