[{@Indradarśana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“seeing Indra,” cf. Arjunābhiga-
<div n="lb">manap.). § 330: After some time {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} taught
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} in private the [Pratismṛti] science ({%upaniṣad,%} i.e.
<div n="lb">{%rahasyavidyā,%} Nīl.; {%bráhman%}) that would reveal the whole
<div n="lb">universe to him, and told him to practise severe austerities;
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), know the fourfold {%(catuṣpāda) Dhanur-%}
<div n="lb">{%veda,%} the {%Brāhma%} weapon, etc.; all celestial weapons are
<div n="lb">in the possession of {%Indra,%} imparted to him by the celestials
<div n="lb">from fear of {%Vṛtra.%} Then {%Arjuna%} took up the {%Gāṇḍīva,%}
<div n="lb">etc., blessed by brahmans, {%Siddhas,%} and invisible spirits
<div n="lb">{%(bhūtāni),%} and by {%Kṛṣṇā%} (she said: “Let no one amongst us
<div n="lb">be ever again born in the order of {%kṣatriyas,%} but as brahmans;
<div n="lb">it is my great grief that in the assembly {%Duryodhana%} called
<div n="lb">me a ‘cow’ (i.e. ‘to be enjoyed by many men,’ Nīl.); but
<div n="lb">the grief of parting with thee is far greater”), who wished
<div n="lb">him success from {%Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ, Hrī, Śrī, Kīrti, Dhṛti,%}
<div n="lb">{%Puṣṭi, Umā, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī,%} the {%Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas,%}
<div n="lb">the hosts {%(gaṇān)%} of the {%Maruts,%} the {%Viśvedevas,%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Sādhyas,%} and wished him safety from the spirits {%(bhūte-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhyaḥ)%} of the sky, earth, and heaven, and all other enemies;
<div n="lb">and having walked round {%(pradakṣiṇaṃ kṛtvā)%} his brothers
<div n="lb">and {%Dhaumya,%} he set out towards the north. All creatures
<div n="lb">left the path of {%Arjuna,%} who was urged by the desire of
<div n="lb">beholding {%Indra (? yuktasyaindreṇa yogena).%} He passed over
<div n="lb">many mountains, and reached {%Himavat%} in one day by means
<div n="lb">of his {%yoga;%} then he passed over {%Gandhamādana,%} etc., and
<div n="lb">reached {%Indrakīla,%} walking night and day untiringly.
<div n="lb">Here he was addressed by a voice in the skies, and beheld
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} in the guise of a brahman, who told him to throw away
<div n="lb">his bow as of no use there, as this was the abode only of
<div n="lb">peaceful brahmans, and advised him to wish for heavenly
<div n="lb">bliss {%(lokāḥ);%} but {%Arjuna%} only asked for the celestial weapons,
<div n="lb">which {%Indra%} said he should obtain when he had seen {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">{%(Tryakṣa, Śūladhara, Bhūteśa, Parameṣṭhin).%} Then {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">disappeared, and {%Arjuna%} remained, devoted to {%yoga%} (III, {@37@}).
