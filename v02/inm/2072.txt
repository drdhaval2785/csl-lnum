[{@Chattropānahotpatti@}]¦ (“the origin of giving umbrellas
<div n="lb">and sandals at {%śrāddhas%}”). § 752{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said: In ancient times {%Jamadagni Bhārgava%} was practising
<div n="lb">with his bow; [his wife] {%Reṇukā%} used to pick up the arrows
<div n="lb">and bring them back to him. One day, at noontide, when
<div n="lb">the Sun was in {%Jyeṣṭhāmūla, Reṇukā,%} her head and feet
<div n="lb">being scorched by the heat of the Sun, rested for a moment
<div n="lb">under a tree, whereafter {%Jamadagni%} threatened to shoot the
<div n="lb">Sun. The Sun, in the guise of a brahman, approached him
<div n="lb">and reminded him that the Sun produces food, etc. (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@95@}). [Further] questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} said: As
<div n="lb">{%Jamadagni%} did not desist from his anger, the brahman reminded
<div n="lb">him that the Sun is always in motion and cannot therefore be
<div n="lb">pierced; {%Jamadagni,%} knowing {%Sūrya,%} said that the Sun stays
<div n="lb">at midday for a moment. Then {%Sūrya%} sought his protection,
<div n="lb">and {%Jamadagni%} comforted him, saying “he who would slay
<div n="lb">one who asks for protection would transcend the simplicity that
<div n="lb">exists in brahmans, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).” {%Sūrya%} presented him with
<div n="lb">an umbrella and a pair of sandals, saying, “from this day the
<div n="lb">gift of these articles in all religious rites shall be established
<div n="lb">as an indispensable usage.” (XIII, {@96@}).
