<div n="lb">{@vāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation between Gautamī, the fowler,
<div n="lb">the serpent, Death, and Time”). § 719{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: An old brahman lady named {%Gautamī%} found
<div n="lb">her son dead, bitten by a serpent; an angry fowler, {%Arjunaka,%}
<div n="lb">bound the serpent with a string and brought it before
<div n="lb">{%Gautamī;%} she told him to release it, as {%brahmans%} do not
<div n="lb">harbour resentment, and there is no good in tormenting and
<div n="lb">killing an enemy; the fowler mentioned how {%Indra%} killed
<div n="lb">{%Vṛtra%} and {%Mahādeva%} destroyed a sacrifice. The serpent said
<div n="lb">that {%Mṛtyu%} had sent him on this errand. {%Mṛtyu%} (masc.)
<div n="lb">appeared and said that {%Kāla%} (Time) was the real promoter;
<div n="lb">{%Sūrya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) are created and destroyed by {%Kāla. Kāla%}
<div n="lb">came and said that it was the child's {%karman%} (deeds in the
<div n="lb">past) that was the cause; this was approved of by {%Gautamī%}
<div n="lb">and the fowler.
