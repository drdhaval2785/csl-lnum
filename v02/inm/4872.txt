<div n="lb">lamented the slaughter of his troops; “formerly in the abode

<div n="lb">{%Saṃśaptakas%} rallying, with a number of {%Śakas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(headed by {%Duryodhana%}), attacked {%Sātyaki; Duḥśāsana%} (with
<div n="lb">a large force of robbers) & {%Sātyaki;%} many elephants of the
<div n="lb">race of {%Añjana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were slain, and many steeds of the
<div n="lb">{%Vanāyu%} race, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and many thousands of warriors;
<div n="lb">many {%Daradas & Sātyaki;%} they fled away. {%Droṇa,%} hearing
<div n="lb">the noise, told his charioteer to take the chariot to the spot
<div n="lb">where {%Yuyudhāna%} was; the charioteer remarked that the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} were rushing against {%Droṇa;%} suddenly
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki%} appeared, and the broken troops and {%Duḥśāsana,%} all
<div n="lb">struck with panic, rushed towards {%Droṇa's%} division (VII, {@121@}).
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} rebuked {%Duḥśāsana%} for his cowardice (quoting his words
<div n="lb">to {%Draupadī%}), and told him to make peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Duḥśāsana%} (with {%Mlecchas%}) & {%Sātyaki. Droṇa%} & the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas%} + the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Droṇa%} slew the {%Pāñśāla%}

<div n="lb">chariot, but was then carried away by his own steeds; having
<div n="lb">caused a great carnage {%Droṇa%} once more took up his station in
<div n="lb">the midst of his own array (VII, {@122@}). {%Duḥśāsana & Sātyaki;%}
<div n="lb">the warriors of {%Duḥśāsana%} (but not himself) fled away.
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} urged a body of 3,000 {%Trigartas%} towards {%Yuyu-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhāna,%} who slew 500; then they turned towards {%Droṇa.%}
<div n="lb">While {%Sātyaki%} was proceeding towards {%Arjuna%} he was again
<div n="lb">attacked by {%Duḥśāsana,%} who was taken up by the {%Trigarta%}
<div n="lb">leader on his chariot; {%Sātyaki%} did not slay him, recollecting
<div n="lb">the words of {%Bhīmasena,%} but quickly proceeded along the track
<div n="lb">of {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@123@}). D. and Cā. wondered. {%Bhīmasena,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), & the {%Kauravas. Sātyaki%} proceeded towards {%Arjuna.%}
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} & the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Duryodhana%} caused a great
<div n="lb">carnage. {%Droṇa%} (in order to rescue {%Duryodhana%}) & the {%Pāñcālas;%}
<div n="lb">a dreadful carnage took place. Then there arose a loud
<div n="lb">uproar from the place where {%Arjuna%} was (VII, {@124@}). In
<div n="lb">the afternoon: {%Droṇa%} & the {%Somakas%} (and {%Pāṇḍavas%});
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhatkṣattra%} (of the {%Kekayas%}) {%& Droṇa;%} both invoked the

<div n="lb">of the {%Kāmboja%} breed), and then {%Dhṛṣtaketu's%} son, and the
<div n="lb">son of {%Jarāsandha.%} The {%Cedis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), & {%Droṇa,%} who slew
<div n="lb">them, especially the foremost among the {%Cedis.%} The {%Pāñcālas%}
<div n="lb">began to tremble and loudly called for {%Bhīmasena%} and

<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Droṇa%} slew {%Kṣatradharman%} ({%Dhṛṣṭa-%}

<div n="lb">asking him to send him a message by uttering a leonine roar
<div n="lb">(VII, {@126@}). {%Bhīma%} requested {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to protect

<div n="lb">understood that all was safe, and thought of {%Arjuna's%} feats

<div n="lb">{%Bhīma's%} horses of the hue of bears and {%Karṇa's%} of the hue

<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} was not pleased with the arrival of {%Sātyaki%} on
