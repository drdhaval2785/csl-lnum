<div n="lb">called {%Prāṇa%} residing within the head, and the heat that is
<div n="lb">there, cause all kinds of exertion. That {%Prāṇa%} is the living
<div n="lb">creature, the universal soul, the eternal Being, and the
<div n="lb">Mind, Intellect, and Consciousness of all living creatures,
<div n="lb">etc. Thus the living being is, in every respect, caused by
<div n="lb">{%Prāṇa%} to move about and exert…That heat, residing
<div n="lb">between {%Apāna%} and {%Prāṇa,%} in the region of the navel,
<div n="lb">operates, with the aid of those two breaths, in digesting all
<div n="lb">food that is taken by a living creature. There is a duct
<div n="lb">beginning from the mouth down to the anal canal. Its
<div n="lb">extremity is called the anus. From this main duct {%(srotas)%}
<div n="lb">numerous subsidiary ones branch out in the bodies of all
<div n="lb">living creatures. In consequence of the rush of the several
<div n="lb">breaths ({%Prāṇa, Samāna,%} etc.) those breaths mingle together.
<div n="lb">The heat {%(agniḥ)%} [that dwells in {%Prāṇa,%} PCR.] is called
<div n="lb">{%Ūṣman.%} It is this heat that causes digestion…The
<div n="lb">breath called {%Prāṇa,%} the bearer of a current of heat, descends
<div n="lb">[from the head, PCR.] downwards to the extremity of the
<div n="lb">anal canal and thence is pushed upwards again. Coming
<div n="lb">back to its seat in the head it once more sends back the heat
<div n="lb">it bears. Below the navel is the region of digested matter,
<div n="lb">and above it that for the food not yet digested. The navel is
<div n="lb">the depositary of all the forces of life, which sustain the body.
<div n="lb">Urged by the ten kinds of breaths the ducts {%(nāḍyaḥ),%}
<div n="lb">branching out from the heart, convey the liquid juices that
<div n="lb">food yields upwards, downwards, and in transverse directions.
<div n="lb">The main duct leading from the mouth to the anus is the
<div n="lb">path by which {%yogins%} succeed in attaining to {%Bráhman%} by
<div n="lb">holding the soul within the brain. Even thus heat is planted
<div n="lb">in the breaths called {%Prāṇa%} and {%Apāna%} of all embodied
<div n="lb">creatures. That heat is always burning there like fire
<div n="lb">in any vessel: XII, {@185,@} 6868, 6870, 6878, 6882.—§ 662{%b%}
