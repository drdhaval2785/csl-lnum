<div n="lb">X-XVII {%°ri°;%} B. mostly {%°ri°%}), son of Abhimanyu and
<div n="lb">Uttarā, and father of Janamejaya. § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I,
<div n="lb">{@2,@} 606 ({%°aḥ…janma, °rī°%} also B.).—§ 51 (cf. Āstīkap.):
<div n="lb">One day king {%P.,%} the son of {%Abhimanyu,%} when hunting,
<div n="lb">having pierced a deer lost sight of it. He then asked the
<div n="lb">muni {%Śamīka,%} but received no answer as the muni was then
<div n="lb">observing the vow of silence; in anger the king then placed
<div n="lb">upon the muni's shoulder a dead snake and returned to his
<div n="lb">capital {%Hāstinapura.%} Of this the muni's son {%Śṛṅgin%} was
<div n="lb">informed in a quarrel by his companion {%Kṛśa%} (I, {@40@}), and
<div n="lb">then cursed {%P.,%} saying that within seven nights he should
<div n="lb">be stung to death by {%Takṣaka.%} The muni was not pleased
<div n="lb">with the curse, as {%P.%} properly protected his subjects (I, {@41@}).
<div n="lb">Therefore he sent his disciple {%Gauramukha%} to inform {%P.,%} who
<div n="lb">became very repentant and sorrowful. A mansion was
<div n="lb">erected upon a solitary column and well guarded. The
<div n="lb">seventh day the brahman {%Kāśyapa%} was coming desirous
<div n="lb">of curing the king. {%Takṣaka%} in the shape of an old
<div n="lb">brahman met with {%Kāśyapa%} (I, {@42@}). As {%Kāśyapa%} revived
<div n="lb">a banyan which had been reduced to ashes by being bitten
<div n="lb">by {%Takṣaka, Takṣaka%} gave to {%Kāśyapa%} more wealth than
<div n="lb">what he expected from {%P.,%} and having ascertained by means
<div n="lb">of {%yoga%} that {%P.'s%} span of life was at an end, {%Kāśyapa%}
<div n="lb">retired. {%Takṣaka%} went to {%Hāstinapura,%} and hearing that {%P.%}
<div n="lb">was protected by poison-neutralizing {%mantras%} and medicines,
<div n="lb">he caused some serpents in the guise of ascetics to present
<div n="lb">the king with {%kuśa-%}grass, water, and fruits, in one of
<div n="lb">which he himself was concealed as a tiny ugly insect.
<div n="lb">As such he appeared when {%P.%} was eating the fruit. {%P.%} said:
<div n="lb">“The sun is setting, to-day I have no more fear from poison;
<div n="lb">therefore let this insect becoming {%Takṣaka%} bite me so that
[Page540-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the words of the ascetic may be rendered true.” Then he
<div n="lb">placed the insect on his neck and was bitten by {%Takṣaka,%}
<div n="lb">who coiled round his neck and uttered a tremendous roar
