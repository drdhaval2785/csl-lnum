<div n="lb">I) {%Pitāmaha%} [i.e. Brahmán] was once performing a sacrifice
<div n="lb">at {%Puṣkara;%} whatever he thought of, immediately appeared,
<div n="lb">the {%Gandharvas%} sung, the {%Apsarases%} danced. The {%ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">missed {%Sarasvatī, Brahmán%} thought of her and she appeared
<div n="lb">there at {%Puṣkara%} under the name of {%Suprabhā.%} II) At
<div n="lb">{%Naimiṣa%} many {%munis%} were assembled, performing sacrifices
<div n="lb">and talking about the {%Vedas,%} they thought of {%Sarasvatī,%} who
<div n="lb">made her appearance and came to be called {%Kāñcanākṣī.%}
<div n="lb">III) Similarly she came to the sacrifice of {%Gaya%} in the country

<div n="lb">(see the note of PCR. pag. 154). VII) At {%Brahmán's%}
<div n="lb">sacrifice on the {%Himavat,%} as {%Vimalodā.%} All these seven
