{@Bakavadhaparvan@}¦ (“the slaughter of Baka,” the 10th
<div n="lb">of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 215: I, {@157@} ff.: The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} for some time dwelt in the abode of the {%brahman,%}
<div n="lb">living on alms; {%Bhīma%} alone used to eat one-half of the
[Page105-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">alms. One day {%Bhīma%} and {%Kuntī%} overheard the {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">complaining (I, {@157@}), and his wife (I, {@158@}) and daughter
<div n="lb">asked to be sacrificed for him to a {%rākṣasa,%} and their little
<div n="lb">son said that he would slay the {%rākṣasa%} with a blade
<div n="lb">of grass. {%Kuntī%} approached (I, {@159@}), and learned that the
<div n="lb">{%rākṣasa Baka%} (“king of the {%Asuras,%}” v. 6808), a cannibal,
<div n="lb">protected the town and the country, receiving as his fee
<div n="lb">a cartload of rice, two buffaloes, and the human being
<div n="lb">who brought them to him, from one after another of the
<div n="lb">householders, while the king, residing in {%Vetrakīyagṛha%} (see
<div n="lb">BR.), did nothing to protect the country against him.
<div n="lb">Now the turn had come for the {%brahman,%} and as he had no
<div n="lb">wealth to buy a man, and could not part with any of his
<div n="lb">family, he would go with all his family to the {%rākṣasa,%} in
<div n="lb">order that he might devour them all (I, {@160@}). {%Kuntī%} said
<div n="lb">that one of her sons would bring the food to the {%rākṣasa.%}
<div n="lb">This the {%brahman%} energetically refused, until she had told
<div n="lb">him that on account of his strength and {%mantras%} her son
<div n="lb">would be safe; but he ought not to disclose this fact to
<div n="lb">anybody, for then people might trouble them out of curiosity,
<div n="lb">and if her son imparted his knowledge to anybody he would
<div n="lb">himself no longer be able to profit by it. {%Bhīma%} also
<div n="lb">consented (I, {@161@}). When the others returned home with
<div n="lb">their alms, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} blamed his mother for her rash act;
<div n="lb">but she relied on {%Bhīma%} (I, {@162@}). The next morning {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">set out for the abode of the {%rākṣasa,%} and approaching he
<div n="lb">began himself to eat the food he carried, loudly calling the
<div n="lb">{%rākṣasa%} by his name. The {%rākṣasa%} came out in a fury;
<div n="lb">but {%Bhīma,%} disregarding his yells and blows, leisurely ate
<div n="lb">up the whole of that food and washed his hands. Then they
<div n="lb">began to hurl trees at each other, and thereupon they clasped
<div n="lb">each other with their arms. At last {%Bhīma%} pressed {%Baka%}
<div n="lb">down to the earth, and placing one knee on the middle of
<div n="lb">his back, bent him double, while he {%(Baka)%} roared frightfully
<div n="lb">and began to vomit blood (I, {@163@}). {%Baka%} died uttering
<div n="lb">frightful yells. The {%rākṣasas,%} his relatives, came and
<div n="lb">promised never again to kill human beings, and from that
<div n="lb">day the {%rākṣasas%} of that region were very peaceful towards
<div n="lb">mankind. {%Bhīma%} placed the corpse at one of the gates of the
<div n="lb">town, and went away unobserved. The {%brahman%} told the
<div n="lb">citizens that it was a {%brahman%} skilled in {%mantras (mantra-%}
<div n="lb">{%siddha)%} who had slain the {%rākṣasa,%} and they established
<div n="lb">a {%Brahma%} festival {%(brahmamahaṃ)%} (I, {@164@}).
