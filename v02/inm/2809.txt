{@Śukakṛtya(ṃ)@}¦ (“the works of Śuka”). § 714 (Mokṣadh.):
<div n="lb">XII, {@328—9@} (12312—12421) (continuation of {%Śukakṛti%}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira:%} Having heard the words of
<div n="lb">{%Janaka,%} having entered Soul by [his] soul and having seen
<div n="lb">Self by his self {%(ātmānam ātmanāsthāya dṛṣṭvā cātmānam%}
<div n="lb">{%ātmanā), Śuka%} without putting further questions to {%Janaka,%}
<div n="lb">proceeded northwards to {%Śaiśira%} (through the air). At
<div n="lb">that time {%Nārada%} proceeded to {%Himavat (b).%} Then {%Śuka%}
<div n="lb">came to the asylum of {%Vyāsa.%} One day the disciples
<div n="lb">asked {%Vyāsa%} to let no sixth disciple be skilled in the
<div n="lb">Veda. {%Vyāsa%} answered that they ought to multiply, and
<div n="lb">the Veda to be spread, and taught them the qualifications
<div n="lb">of persons that can be accepted as disciples, and the rules
<div n="lb">in respect of the study of the Veda (XII, {@328@}). The
<div n="lb">disciples of {%Vyāsa%} took leave of him and descended from
<div n="lb">the mountain to the earth for the purpose of subdividing the
[Page219-b+ 62]
<div n="lb">Vedas; there they performed the agniṣṭoma, etc., at the
<div n="lb">sacrifices of Brahmans, Kṣattriyas, and Vaiśyas, and taught
<div n="lb">the Veda. {%Vyāsa%} remained with {%Śuka,%} passing his days in
<div n="lb">anxious thoughtfulness. {%Nārada%} came and asked him why
<div n="lb">Vedic sounds were silent now, so that the mountain now
<div n="lb">resembled a hamlet of {%Niṣādas,%} and Ṛ., D., and G. did no
<div n="lb">longer shine as before; and exhorted {%Vyāsa%} to recite the
<div n="lb">Veda and thereby dispel the fears arising from Rā. {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Śuka%} then set themselves to recite the Veda. One day
<div n="lb">a violent wind arose which {%Vyāsa%} declared to be an omen
<div n="lb">that the recitation of the Veda should be suspended; and he
<div n="lb">explained the {%Devayāna%} and the {%Pitṛyāna,%} and the Winds
<div n="lb">({%Samāna,%} etc. {%[g];%} cf. {%Sādhyāḥ%}), especially {%Pravaha (h),%}
<div n="lb">{%Āvaha (i), Udvaha (j), Saṃvaha (k), Vivaha (l), Parivaha%}
<div n="lb">{%(m), Parāvaha (n);%} “this wind is the breath of {%Viṣṇu's%}
<div n="lb">nostrils.” Having said this {%Vyāsa%} plunged into the celestial
<div n="lb">Ganges. (For continuation v. {%Śuka-Nāradasaṃvāda.%})
