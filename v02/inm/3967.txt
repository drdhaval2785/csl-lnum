[{@Gandhamādana-praveśa(ḥ)@}]¦ (“proceeding to the
<div n="lb">Gandhamādana”). § 419 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">in vain proposed that {%Bhīma%} should return with {%Kṛṣṇā,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva, Dhaumya,%} the charioteers, cooks, etc., to {%Gaṅgā-%}
<div n="lb">{%dvāra,%} while {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should proceed with {%Nakula%} and
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa. Bhīma%} promised to carry {%Kṛṣṇā%} and the twins.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇā%} said that she would be able to go. They entrusted
<div n="lb">to the {%Pulinda%} king (v. 10866, {%Kulindānāṃ%}) {%Subāhu%} on the
<div n="lb">{%Himavat%} (inhabited by {%Kirātas, Taṅgaṇas,%} and {%Pulindas%}),
<div n="lb">the servants {%Indrasena,%} etc., the cooks and stewards, and
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī's%} accoutrements, and began to proceed (III, {@140@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 420: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} complained to {%Bhīma%} that he had not
<div n="lb">seen {%Arjuna%} for five years. They now should, in company with
<div n="lb">brahmans of strict vows, enter {%Gandhamādana (b),%} etc. (III,
<div n="lb">{@141@}).—§ 421: Exhorted by {%Lomaśa,%} when they were about
<div n="lb">to go to the mountain {%Mandara (b),%} they adored {%Ākāśagaṅgā%}
<div n="lb">(v. 10902, read with B. {%puṇyā%} for {%puśyā%}) (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and then
<div n="lb">proceeded with the {%ṛṣis.%}—§ 422: Then they saw the bones
<div n="lb">of the {%Daitya Naraka (b)%} like to a white mountain.—§ 422 {%bis:%}
<div n="lb">Varāhāvatāra (q.v.), III, {@142.@}—§ 423: As they, with the
<div n="lb">brahmans, entered {%Gandhamādana (b)%} a terrible wind arose,
<div n="lb">followed by showers of rain, lightning, and torrents, during
<div n="lb">which they took shelter under trees, etc., {%Sahadeva%} carrying
<div n="lb">the sacred fire {%(agnihotrāṇi).%} When the tempest was over
<div n="lb">and the sun reappeared, they continued their journey (III,
<div n="lb">{@143@}). When they had proceeded only a {%krośa, Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">sank down. {%Nakula%} ran forward and supported her, and the
<div n="lb">others hastily came, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} took her on his lap and
<div n="lb">lamented. {%Dhaumya%} and the other brahmans comforted and
<div n="lb">blessed him, and by reciting {%mantras%} capable of dispelling
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas,%} and by performing ceremonies, while she was
<div n="lb">touched and fanned by the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} they made her regain
<div n="lb">her senses. The twins pressed her feet with their hands.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} promised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to carry them all over the
<div n="lb">snowy mountains, “or {%Ghaṭotkaca%} will carry us all.” With
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} permission {%Bhīma%} thought of {%Ghaṭotkaca,%} who
<div n="lb">immediately came and was embraced by {%Bhīma%} (III, {@144@}).
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca%} carried {%Kṛṣṇā%} through the air, and hundreds of
<div n="lb">other {%Rākṣasas%} carried the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the brahmans,
<div n="lb">while {%Lomaśa%} moved along the path of the {%Siddhas.%} So they
<div n="lb">proceeded through regions inhabited by {%Mlecchas, Vidyā-%}
<div n="lb">{%dharas,%} monkeys, {%Kinnaras, Kimpuruṣas, Gandharvas,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">and the northern {%Kurus,%} towards {%Kailāsa%} and {%Badarī (c),%} where
<div n="lb">they were received by the numerous {%ṛṣis,%} and where they
<div n="lb">dwelt, beholding {%Maināka, Hiraṇyaśikkara, Bindusaras,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Bhāgīrathī,%} and offering oblations, etc. (III, {@145@})
