[{@Sauptikaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section including the
<div n="lb">nightly attack”: {%(a)%} the 10th of the greater parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr., including the 83rd and the 84th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans; {%(b)%} the 83rd of the minor parvans; cf. Sauptika):
<div n="lb">§ 616: {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. proceeded towards the south. At
<div n="lb">the hour of sunset they reached a spot near the encampment.
<div n="lb">Hearing the shouts in the {%Pāṇḍava%} camp, they proceeded
<div n="lb">farther and reached a dense forest. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} interrupted
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} by expressing his grief for {%Duryodhana,%} and then
<div n="lb">inquired about the acts of the three survivors (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">continued: {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc., laid themselves down for rest
<div n="lb">under a huge banyan; {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} fell asleep;
[Page634-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} was kept awake by wrath and the desire of
<div n="lb">vengeance. He saw a fierce owl coming to that banyan and
<div n="lb">slaying a large number of crows roosting on its branches; at this
<div n="lb">sight he formed the resolution of slaying the {%Pāṇḍava%} army
<div n="lb">while buried in sleep; he roused {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman,%}
<div n="lb">unfolded his project before them, and asked for their advice
<div n="lb">(X, {@1@}); {%Kṛpa%} dissuaded him from executing his wicked
<div n="lb">design; “Let us repair to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vidura,%} and ask them as to what we should do” (X, {@2@});
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} tried to refute {%Kṛpa's%} arguments (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (X, {@3@}).
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa%} promised to aid {%Aśvatthāman%} if the latter would fight
<div n="lb">the foe the next morning during daylight (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Aśvatthāman's%}
<div n="lb">answer: he would not desist (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (X, {@4@}). {%Kṛpa%} earnestly
<div n="lb">remonstrated with {%Aśvatthāman,%} who declared his resolution
<div n="lb">to be unaltered (<lang n="greek"></lang>), yoked his steeds to his chariot, and
<div n="lb">proceeded alone, saying that he would avenge his father
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} followed him. Approaching the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍava%} camp, {%Aśvatthāman%} stopped at the gate (X, {@5@}).
<div n="lb">He beheld a being of gigantic frame (description; hundreds
<div n="lb">and thousands of {%Hṛṣīkeśas%} issued from its flames) ready to
<div n="lb">resist him, and fearlessly fought it; it devoured all the
<div n="lb">weapons of {%Aśvatthāman,%} who repented of his rash deed, and
<div n="lb">resolved to seek the protection of {%Mahādeva%} (X, {@6@}), to whom
<div n="lb">he recited a hymn (<lang n="greek"></lang>). A golden altar appeared before him
<div n="lb">with a blazing fire on it; many mighty beings of extra-
<div n="lb">ordinary appearance came there (description), worshippers of
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva. Aśvatthāman%} felt no fear at the sight; he offered
<div n="lb">himself to {%Mahādeva%} as a libation on the fire; {%Mahādeva%}
<div n="lb">appeared and declared that the period of life of everybody in
<div n="lb">the camp had ran out; he gave a sword to {%Aśvatthāman%} and
<div n="lb">filled him with his own energy; many invisible beings and
<div n="lb">Rā. proceeded to his right and left as he set out (X, {@7@}).
<div n="lb">He asked {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} to stand at the gate and
<div n="lb">slay everybody who would seek to escape; he entered the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍava%} camp like a thief and slew {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(description; he employed the {%Rudra%} weapon); Rā. uttered
<div n="lb">loud roars in joy; also Y. came there; {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%}
<div n="lb">set fire to the {%Pāṇḍava%} camp in three places; “{%Arjuna%} is
<div n="lb">incapable of being vanquished by D., As., G., Y., and Rā.”
<div n="lb">Before midnight the vast host of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} was slain by
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman;%} the camp was invaded by Rā. and Pś. that
<div n="lb">gorge upon blood and flesh. {%Aśvatthāman%} forgot his grief for
<div n="lb">his father; when morning dawned he issued from the camp
<div n="lb">and joined {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked why
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} did not achieve such a feat before; {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">answered that the absence of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with {%Kṛṣṇa,%} as
<div n="lb">also the sleep, was the cause of {%Aśvatthāman's%} success. They
<div n="lb">congratulated each other and resolved to give notice of
<div n="lb">the slaughter to {%Duryodhana%} (X, {@8@}). They beheld {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} still living, surrounded by wolves, hyenas, etc. They
<div n="lb">lamented and informed him (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Aśvatthāman%} asked him,
<div n="lb">when he came to heaven, to inform {%Droṇa%} and embrace
<div n="lb">{%Bāhlīka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and informed him who were yet alive (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">and who had been slain (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Duryodhana%} regained his senses
<div n="lb">and praised {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Saying “we shall all
<div n="lb">meet again in heaven”, he gave up his life-breaths; his soul
<div n="lb">ascended to heaven. At early dawn {%Sañjaya%} came to the
<div n="lb">city and lost his spiritual sight. {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc., ascended
<div n="lb">their chariots. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} breathed long and hot sighs
<div n="lb">(X, {@9@}).
