[{@Anugītāparvan@}]¦ (“the section containing the repetition
<div n="lb">of the Bhagavadgītā,”) the 94th of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Anugītā). § 782: {%Janamejaya%} said: When
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna,%} after having slain their enemies, dwelt
<div n="lb">there in the palace, what conversation took place between
<div n="lb">them? {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Arjuna,%} having recovered his
<div n="lb">kingdom, spent his time joyously in the company of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">in that beautiful palace. There they repaired to a particular
<div n="lb">part of the palace with their friends and relatives. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to repeat to him what he had taught him before
<div n="lb">the battle [i.e. Bhagavadgītā], especially as he would soon
<div n="lb">repair to {%Dvārakā. Kṛṣṇa%} is discontented because {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">cannot remember it; he would now, however, recite an old
<div n="lb">story upon the same topic. “There came a brahman from
<div n="lb">{%Svargaloka%} and was honoured by us; hear what he said, asked
<div n="lb">by us.” The brahman said: There came a brahman {%Kāśyapa,%}
<div n="lb">possessed of penance, etc., to some other brahman, who had
<div n="lb">become conversant with all the authorities on religion, etc.,
<div n="lb">crowned with ascetic success {%(siddhaṃ),%} able to move everywhere
<div n="lb">at will {%(kramamāṇaṃ),%} knowing the science of disappearing
<div n="lb">at will, roving with invisible {%Siddhas%} and celestial musicians
<div n="lb">({%?cakradharaiḥ,%} PCR.); {%Kāśyapa%} honoured him as his {%guru,%}
<div n="lb">and the brahman spoke to him about transmigration, comparing
<div n="lb">his own example; at last he had renounced the world and
<div n="lb">attained to his present success, and should not have to return
<div n="lb">to this world, but would come to “{%Bráhman's%} eternal abode”;
<div n="lb">he promised to answer {%Kāśyapa's%} questions (XIV, {@16@}).
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: Asked by {%Kāśyapa,%} the brahman discoursed on
<div n="lb">how {%Jīva%} casts off and then attains to a body, how Emanci-
<div n="lb">pation is achieved, and where acts do exist when {%Jīva%} becomes
<div n="lb">divested of body, etc.; how death is brought about; the
<div n="lb">happiness and misery of {%Jīva%} determined by acts (XIV, {@17@});
<div n="lb">how {%Jīva%} enters the womb; {%Brahmán%} first formed a body
<div n="lb">of his own, then he created {%Pradhāna,%} the material cause
<div n="lb">{%(prakṛtiṃ)%} of all embodied creatures; indifference to pleasure
<div n="lb">and pain leads to the Supreme Seat (XIV, {@18@}); who is said
<div n="lb">to be emancipated; on the science of {%yoga;%} how {%Jīva%} attains to
<div n="lb">emancipation.—{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: Then the brahman disappeared;
<div n="lb">this discourse was, in fact, what thou (Arjuna) heardst on
<div n="lb">thy car; this is a great mystery even to the gods; at no
<div n="lb">time or place has this been heard by man in this world; by
<div n="lb">adhering to this religion, even those who are of sinful birth,
<div n="lb">women, {%vaiśyas,%} and {%śūdras,%} attain to the highest goal; {%yoga%}
[Page057-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">takes place in his case who devotes himself to its constant
<div n="lb">practice {%(nityayuktasya)%} for a period of six months (XIV, {@19@}).
<div n="lb">In this connection the ancient narrative of a discourse between
<div n="lb">a married couple is cited: [Brāhmaṇagītā] {%(b)%} (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@20—34@}). Asked by {%Arjuna%} about {%Bráhman, Kṛṣṇa%} recited
<div n="lb">the old story of the discourse between a preceptor and his
<div n="lb">disciple on this subject: Guruśiṣyasaṃvāda {%(g).%} Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa%} said that he is the preceptor, and the
<div n="lb">mind his pupil; “formerly, when the hour of battle came,
<div n="lb">this very religion was declared by me; and now, it is long
<div n="lb">since I saw my father; I wish to see him again with thy
<div n="lb">leave.”—{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Arjuna%} replied: “We shall go
<div n="lb">to-day from this town to {%Hāstinapura%} and inform {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%}” (XIV, {@35—51@}).—§ 783: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">caused {%Dāruka%} to yoke his car, and then set out for {%Hāstina-%}
<div n="lb">{%pura%} with {%Arjuna. Arjuna%} praised {%Kṛṣṇa,%} “the soul of the
<div n="lb">universe, etc.,” as he had learned from {%Nārada,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">saying that {%Śrī%} is always established in him, and mentioning
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Arrived at {%Hāstinapura,%} they entered
<div n="lb">the palace of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} where they saw {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%} passed the night in the apartments of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna.%} At morning they proceeded to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who
<div n="lb">sat with his ministers; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} mentioned {%Vasudeva%} (his
<div n="lb">maternal uncle), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to think of {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and to come back to his horse-sacrifice.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} took no gifts from him, took leave of {%Kuntī%} (his
<div n="lb">maternal aunt), {%Vidura,%} etc., and then set out from {%Hāstina-%}
<div n="lb">{%pura%} with {%Subhadrā%} on the car, accompanied by {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then, having caused them to return, he
<div n="lb">with {%Dāruka%} and {%Sātyaki%} proceeded to the city of the {%Ānarttas%}
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@52@}).—§ 784: {%Arjuna%} repeatedly embraced {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (omens). As he came to the desert, he beheld {%Utaṅka%}
<div n="lb">{%(b)%} (XIV, {@53—58@}).—§ 785: {%Janamejaya%} said: What did
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} next do, after having granted that boon to {%Utaṅka?%}
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Having granted that boon to {%Utaṅka,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} accompanied by {%Sātyaki,%} proceeded to {%Dvārakā%} on
<div n="lb">his car, passing many lakes and rivers and forests and hills.
<div n="lb">He came there when the festival of {%Raivataka%} had begun;
<div n="lb">the {%Raivataka%} hill shone with great splendour (description;
<div n="lb">the trees looked like the {%kalpa%}-trees of {%Indra's%} garden; the
<div n="lb">mountain looked like {%Meru%}); gifts were ceaselessly being
<div n="lb">made to the distressed, or blind, or helpless. {%Kṛṣṇa%} re-
<div n="lb">counted the incidents of the great battle to his father (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@59@}). {%Vasudeva%} said: Tell me about the battle between
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vaiśampāyana%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} narrated, also in the presence of his mother, how
<div n="lb">the {%Kaurava%} heroes had been slain in battle. {%Kṛṣṇa's%}
<div n="lb">narrative of the battle (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣṇis%} became filled with grief (XIV, {@60@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">had passed by the slaughter of {%Abhimanyu; Subhadrā%}
<div n="lb">noticed it and fell down; {%Vasudeva%} then also fell down, and
<div n="lb">then asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to tell the whole truth (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">consoled him (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XIV, {@61@}). {%Vasudeva%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">made excellent obsequial offerings to {%Abhimanyu,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">fed six millions of brahmans and gave away heaps of gold, etc.
<div n="lb">Also the {%Pāṇḍavas%} at {%Hāstinapura%} were filled with grief for
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu; Uttarā%} totally abstained from all food, and her
<div n="lb">relatives feared for her embryo; {%Vyāsa%} came and predicted to
<div n="lb">{%Pṛthā, Uttarā, Arjuna,%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} that the son of
<div n="lb">{%Uttarā%} would become a great prince, through the influence
<div n="lb">of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Vyāsa; Abhimanyu%} had gone to the regions of
<div n="lb">the gods. {%Arjuna%} became cheerful; the child in {%Uttarā's%}
<div n="lb">womb grew like the moon in the bright fortnight; {%Vyāsa%}
[Page058-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to perform the horse-sacrifice, and
<div n="lb">disappeared; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} set his mind on the journey for
<div n="lb">bringing wealth (XIV, {@62@}). {%Janamejaya%} said: Having
<div n="lb">heard these words of {%Vyāsa,%} what steps were taken by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira?%}—how did he succeed in obtaining the wealth
<div n="lb">of {%Marutta? Vaiśampāyana%} said: Having heard the words
<div n="lb">of {%Vyāsa, Yudhiṣṭhira%} summoned all his brothers, reminding
<div n="lb">them of the words of {%Vyāsa, Bhīṣma,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} about
<div n="lb">{%Marutta's%} gold; {%Bhīmasena%} was of his opinion, saying that
<div n="lb">they must worship {%Śiva%} and his followers; then the K.s, who
<div n="lb">protected the treasures, would certainly yield; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">was pleased; the others, headed by {%Arjuna,%} approved. The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} ordered their army to march under the {%nakṣatra%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhruva%} (i.e. {%Rohiṇī,%} Nīl.), and on the day {%Dhruva%} (i.e. Sunday,
<div n="lb">Nīl.), and set out, having worshipped {%Śiva%} with {%modakas,%}
<div n="lb">frumenty, and cakes of meat, taking leave of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and keeping {%Yuyutsu%} in the capital (XIV, {@63@}).
<div n="lb">Then they set out (description); arrived at the spot, they
<div n="lb">pitched their camp, placing the brahmans and {%Āgniveśya%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Dhaumya,%} Nīl.) in the van; then the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the
<div n="lb">other kings, and the brahmans and priests, having performed
<div n="lb">propitiatory rites, and placing the king and his ministers in
<div n="lb">the middle, caused the camp to be pitched by laying out six
<div n="lb">roads and nine divisions; king {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused a separate
<div n="lb">encampment to be made for the infuriated elephants; the
<div n="lb">brahmans declared this very day to be an auspicious one;
<div n="lb">on this day they would live upon water alone, and they
<div n="lb">should all fast; they passed the night on beds of {%kuśa-%}
<div n="lb">grass, listening to the discourses of the learned brahmans.
<div n="lb">When the cloudless morning came, the brahmans told {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} (XIV, {@64@}) to make offerings to {%Śiva. Dhaumya%}
<div n="lb">performed the rites (description), and gave {%bali%} to the servants
<div n="lb">of {%Śiva;%} offerings were next made to {%Kubera, Maṇibhadra,%}
<div n="lb">and to the other Y. and lords of Bh. (with {%kṛśaras,%} and
<div n="lb">meat, and {%nivāpas%} mixed with sesame seeds); the king gave
<div n="lb">thousands of cows to the brahmans; then he ordered {%bali%}
<div n="lb">for the night-wandering Bh. Then the king, placing {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">ahead, proceeded to the spot where the treasure was, once
<div n="lb">more worshipping {%Kubera,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Numerous costly
<div n="lb">vessels were dug out and placed in wooden chests, etc.;
<div n="lb">there were 60,000 camels, 120,000 horses, and 100,000
<div n="lb">elephants, etc. (description). Once more worshipping {%Śiva,%}
<div n="lb">they set out for {%Hāstinapura%} with the permission of {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">and placing {%Dhaumya%} in the van, marched a {%goyuta%} (four
<div n="lb">miles, PCR.) every day (XIV, {@65@}). Meanwhile, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">with {%Pradyumna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came to see {%Draupadī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and
<div n="lb">was received by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Uttarā%} gave birth
<div n="lb">to {%Parikṣit,%} who was born without life, afflicted with the
<div n="lb">{%Brāhma%} weapon; {%Kuntī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), lamented, and {%Kuntī%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} who came with {%Yuyudhāna,%} to revive him and rescue
<div n="lb">{%Uttarā,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), reminding him that {%Abhimanyu%} had said to
<div n="lb">{%Uttarā%} that her son would learn the art of weapons, etc., by
<div n="lb">the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas; Kṛṣṇa%} comforted her (XIV, {@66@}).
<div n="lb">Then {%Subhadrā%} lamented (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XIV, {@67@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} entered the
<div n="lb">lying-in room (description; with articles destructive of Rā.);
<div n="lb">{%Uttarā%} lamented (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XIV, {@68@}), and so did {%Kuntī,%} etc.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} touched water and withdrew the {%Brāhma%} weapon,
<div n="lb">and “as {%Kaṃsa%} and {%Keśin%} have rightly been slain by me, etc.”
<div n="lb">{%(tena satyena),%} he revived the child (XIV, {@69@}). {%Parikṣit%}
<div n="lb">illumined the lying-in room with his energy; Rā. fled or
<div n="lb">were destroyed; a voice in the sky applauded {%Kṛṣṇa;%}
<div n="lb">the {%Brāhma%} weapon returned to {%Brahmán;%} at the command
<div n="lb">of {%Kṛṣṇa%} the brahmans were made to utter benedictions;
[Page058-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were glad and praised {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and so did
<div n="lb">wrestlers, actors, astrologers, etc.; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and the other
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣṇi%} chiefs made precious gifts to the child, whom {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">called {%Parikṣit%} (etymology). When he was a month old,
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} came back with the wealth, and were received
<div n="lb">by those {%Vṛṣṇis%} and the citizens; {%Vidura%} ordered various
<div n="lb">kinds of worship to be offered to the gods in their temples,
<div n="lb">etc.; with dancers and singers, the city resembled the mansion
<div n="lb">of {%Kubera,%} etc. (description) (XIV, {@70@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} and his
<div n="lb">ministers went out to see the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} who entered the city
<div n="lb">together with the {%Vṛṣṇis,%} and worshipped {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), and also {%Kṛṣṇa,%} having heard how he had revived
<div n="lb">{%Parikṣit;%} after a few days {%Vyāsa%} came and was worshipped
<div n="lb">by the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas,%} and he permitted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
<div n="lb">perform the horse-sacrifice, “a purifier of all sinners.” {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to perform the sacrifice; but {%Kṛṣṇa%} told
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to appoint them to whatever tasks he likes;
<div n="lb">“when thou sacrificest, {%Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), will be sacri-
<div n="lb">ficing” (XIV, {@71@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Vyāsa%} to cause him
<div n="lb">to be initiated; {%Vyāsa%} said that he and {%Paila%} and {%Yājñavalkya%}
<div n="lb">would perform the rites; the initiation would be performed
<div n="lb">on the day of full moon in the month of {%Caitra;%} “let {%sūtas%}
<div n="lb">and brahmans well versed in the science of horses select
<div n="lb">a worthy horse”; all the articles were duly procured; {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">ordained that the {%sphya%} and the {%kūrca%} should be made of
<div n="lb">gold; “let the horse be loosened to-day.” Asked by {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} ordained that {%Arjuna%} should protect the horse;
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena%} the kingdom aided by {%Nakula; Sahadeva%} should
<div n="lb">attend to all the relatives invited (with the permission of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Arjuna%} to spare all hostile
<div n="lb">kings as much as possible and to invite them to the horse-
<div n="lb">sacrifice (XIV, {@72@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was initiated by the {%Ṛtvijs%}
<div n="lb">(description); the horse was let loose. {%Arjuna%} with {%Gāṇḍīva%}
<div n="lb">followed the horse; all {%Hāstinapura%} came out wanting to
<div n="lb">behold him; a disciple of {%Yājñavalkya%} followed him in order
<div n="lb">to perform auspicious rites for him; and also many brahmans
<div n="lb">and {%kṣattriyas.%} During the horse's wanderings many great
<div n="lb">and wonderful battles were fought; the horse wandered over
<div n="lb">the whole earth; from the north it turned to the east:
<div n="lb">kings in myriads fought against {%Arjuna%} because they had lost
<div n="lb">their kinsmen on the field of {%Kurukṣetra,%} and innumerable
<div n="lb">{%Kirātas, Yavanas, Mlecchas,%} and {%Āryas;%} “I shall narrate
<div n="lb">only the principal battles” (XIV, {@73@}). The {%Trigartas%} (the
<div n="lb">sons and grandsons of the slain) attacked {%Arjuna,%} who in vain
<div n="lb">asked them to forbear; the {%Trigarta%} king {%Sūryavarman &%}
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} who slew {%Sūryavarman's%} younger brother {%Ketuvarman;%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtavarman & Arjuna,%} who was wounded in his hand and
<div n="lb">let fall {%Gāṇḍīva,%} but took it up again and slew eighteen
<div n="lb">warriors; the {%Trigartas%} fled and accepted {%Arjuna's%} dominion
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@74@}). In {%Prāgjyotiṣa, Bhagadatta's%} son king {%Vajra-%}
<div n="lb">{%datta%} (description) attacked {%Arjuna%} on his elephant, but, after
<div n="lb">a fierce battle (XIV, {@75@}) lasting three days, he on the fourth
<div n="lb">day had his elephant slain, and he promised to come to the
<div n="lb">horse-sacrifice (XIV, {@76@}). Recollecting {%Jayadratha,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Saindhavas,%} mounted on cars, attacked {%Arjuna,%} who was on
<div n="lb">foot; a terrible wind began to blow, and {%Rāhu%} swallowed up
<div n="lb">both the sun and the moon at the same time, etc.; {%Kailāsa%}
<div n="lb">began to tremble; the seven Ṛ. and the other Ṛ. of heaven
<div n="lb">breathed hot sighs; Indra's bow appeared in the sky, and clouds
<div n="lb">poured flesh and blood on the earth; {%Gāṇḍīva%} fell down; the
<div n="lb">gods, D.-ṛ., {%Saptarṣis,%} and B.-ṛ. recited {%(jepuḥ)%} “victory” to
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} who once more used his bow; the {%Saindhavas%} fled
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@77@}), but once more rallied; {%Arjuna%} urged them to
[Page059-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">surrender, but in vain, because they only thought of {%Jayadratha;%}
<div n="lb">many were slain; then {%Duḥśalā,%} taking her grandson, the son
<div n="lb">of {%Suratha%} [the son of {%Jayadratha%}], in her arms, repaired to
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna; Arjuna%} dropped his bow and asked about {%Suratha;%}
<div n="lb">she said that he had died from sorrow when he heard of
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna's%} arrival; she drew a parallel between {%Suratha's%}
<div n="lb">[orphan] son and {%Abhimanyu's%} [orphan] son {%Parikṣit.%}
<div n="lb">Recollecting {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Gāndhārī,%} and censuring
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriya%} practices and {%Duryodhana, Arjuna%} consoled and
<div n="lb">embraced her; {%Duḥśalā%} asked her warriors to desist, and
<div n="lb">returned home. At last the horse arrived at {%Maṇipūra%}
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@78@}), where {%Babhruvāhana, Arjuna's%} son by {%Citrāṅ-%}
<div n="lb">{%gadā,%} humbly approached {%Arjuna,%} together with a number
<div n="lb">of brahmans, bringing treasure in his van; {%Arjuna%} angrily
<div n="lb">blamed him for having neglected his duty as a {%kṣattriya.%}
<div n="lb">{%Ulūpī%} came from within the earth and beheld her [step-]son
<div n="lb">standing cheerless, and incited him to fight {%Arjuna,%} which
<div n="lb">he did (description of his car); he even caused the sacrificial
<div n="lb">horse to be seized; gravely wounded, {%Arjuna%} praised his son
<div n="lb">highly; he cut off his standard, which was set with gold and
<div n="lb">resembled a golden palmyra, and then he slew his steeds; at
<div n="lb">last {%Arjuna%} fell down in a swoon, and so did {%Babhruvāhana;%}
<div n="lb">{%Citrāṅgadā%} repaired to the battlefield weeping piteously
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@79@}); she indulged in copious lamentations, lost her
<div n="lb">senses, and fell down on the earth; regaining consciousness
<div n="lb">and seeing {%Ulūpī,%} she blamed her for having brought about
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna's%} slaughter by {%Babhruvāhana,%} and asked her to revive
<div n="lb">him; “I do not grieve for my slain son, I only grieve for my
<div n="lb">husband”; otherwise she would sit in {%prāya%} and die; the
<div n="lb">horse she had set free. Regaining consciousness {%Babhruvāhana%}
<div n="lb">lamented piteously, saying that now he had slain his father, he
<div n="lb">would wander over the earth, covering himself with his father's
<div n="lb">skin, or with the two halves of his head, as an expiation, or
<div n="lb">else he would die; he took an oath (touching water) that, if
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} was not revived, he would emaciate his own body,
<div n="lb">sitting on the field of battle; “I shall without doubt have to
<div n="lb">sink into hell; he who has slain a heroic {%kṣattriya%} becomes
<div n="lb">purified by making a gift of 100 cows; I, who have slain
<div n="lb">my father, cannot be rescued.” {%Ulūpī%} thought of the gem
<div n="lb">that has the virtue of reviving a dead man; the gem, thus
<div n="lb">thought of, came there; she said that {%Arjuna%} had not been
<div n="lb">vanquished by {%Babhruvāhana,%} but {%Ulūpī%} had exhibited this
<div n="lb">illusion for the benefit of {%Arjuna.%} As soon as the prince
<div n="lb">had placed the gem on the breast of {%Arjuna%} the latter
<div n="lb">revived. {%Indra%} poured down celestial flowers, etc. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">wondered why the two ladies were present, and why every-
<div n="lb">thing seemed to indicate grief, and asked {%Babhruvāhana%}
<div n="lb">who told him to question {%Ulūpī%} (XIV, {@80@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna, Ulūpī%} recited the curse of the {%Vasus%} (approved by
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%}) because {%Arjuna%} had slain {%Bhīṣma%} in unfair fight
<div n="lb">(while he was engaged with {%Śikhaṇḍin%} and had ceased to
<div n="lb">fight); if {%Arjuna%} had died without having expiated his sin
<div n="lb">he would have fallen into Hell; hearing the curse of the
<div n="lb">{%Vasus, Ulūpī%} had consulted her father, who prevailed upon
<div n="lb">the {%Vasus%} that {%Arjuna%} should be freed from their curses
<div n="lb">when he had been slain by {%Babhruvāhana. Arjuna%} highly
<div n="lb">approved of {%Ulūpī's%} action, and told {%Babhruvāhana%} to come
<div n="lb">with his mother and counsellors and officers to the horse-
<div n="lb">sacrifice; {%Babhruvāhana%} promised to come and to take upon
<div n="lb">himself the task of distributing food among the brahmans
<div n="lb">{%(dvijātipariveśakaḥ).%} He asked {%Arjuna%} to pass the night in
<div n="lb">the city with his two wives; but {%Arjuna%} was prevented by
<div n="lb">his vow of following the horse; he took leave and proceeded
[Page059-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">on his way (XIV, {@81@}). The horse, having wandered over
<div n="lb">the whole earth, turned its face towards {%Hāstinapura.%} At
<div n="lb">{%Rājagṛha,%} the {%Magadha%} king {%Meghasandhi,%} son of {%Sahadeva,%}
<div n="lb">attacked {%Arjuna,%} who was on foot, from his chariot;
<div n="lb">{%Meghasandhi%} was worsted, but spared and told to come to the
<div n="lb">horse-sacrifice. The horse then proceeded along the sea-coast
<div n="lb">through the country of the {%Vaṅgas, Puṇḍras,%} and {%Kośalas;%}
<div n="lb">in these countries {%Arjuna%} vanquished innumerable {%Mleccha%}
<div n="lb">armies (XIV, {@82@}). {%Arjuna%} proceeded towards the south.
<div n="lb">The horse came to {%Cuktimatī,%} the beautiful city of the {%Cedis.%}
<div n="lb">{%Śarabha,%} the son of {%Śiśupāla,%} fought {%Arjuna,%} and then
<div n="lb">worshipped him. Then the horse came to the {%Kāśis, Aṅgas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kośalas, Kirātas,%} and {%Taṅgaṇas;%} then to the {%Daśārṇas,%}
<div n="lb">whose ruler {%Citrāṅgada%} was vanquished by {%Arjuna;%} then
<div n="lb">to the dominions of the {%Niṣāda%} king, the son of {%Ekalavya,%}
<div n="lb">who was vanquished after a furious battle; then towards the
<div n="lb">southern ocean, where the {%Draviḍas, Andhras, Māhiṣakas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kolvagireyas%} (B. {%Kolla°%}) were subjugated; then to the
<div n="lb">{%Surāṣṭras, Gokarṇa, Prabhāsa,%} and {%Dvāravatī,%} where the
<div n="lb">{%Yādava%} youths were going to beat the horse, but were
<div n="lb">forbidden by King {%Ugrasena,%} who came to {%Arjuna%} with
<div n="lb">{%Vasudeva.%} Then the horse proceeded along the coast of the
<div n="lb">western ocean to the prosperous country of the five rivers;
<div n="lb">then to the {%Gāndhāras,%} where a fierce battle ensued with the
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhāra%} king, the son of {%Śakuni%} (XIV, {@83@}), who wanted
<div n="lb">to avenge the slaughter of {%Śakuni;%} many {%Gāndhāras%} were
<div n="lb">slain; at last the king, disregarding {%Arjuna's%} peaceful advice,
<div n="lb">fought alone; {%Arjuna%} shot off his headgear; then he and all
<div n="lb">the {%Gāndhāras%} fled; the mother of the king and all the aged
<div n="lb">ministers came out and forbade her son to fight; {%Arjuna%} said
<div n="lb">he had spared him for the sake of {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">and told him to come to the horse-sacrifice (XIV, {@84@}). The
<div n="lb">horse then turned towards the road that led to {%Hāstinapura.%}
<div n="lb">As these tidings reached the {%Kuru%} court through the intelli-
<div n="lb">gence-bearers, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} rejoiced, and on the twelfth day
<div n="lb">of the bright fortnight of {%Māgha,%} under a favourable con-
<div n="lb">stellation, he summoned his brothers (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and caused {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">to let learned brahmans select a beautiful spot for the sacri-
<div n="lb">ficial compound (description). Then {%Bhīma%} sent messengers
<div n="lb">to invite the kings of the earth; they brought gems, female
<div n="lb">slaves, horses, and weapons. All the foremost brahmans also
<div n="lb">came there with their disciples; likewise many dialecticians
<div n="lb">disputing with each other. All was made of gold. One
<div n="lb">hundred thousand brahmans were fed; many mountains of food,
<div n="lb">many large tanks of curds, and many lakes of ghee were seen
<div n="lb">there. The entire population of {%Jambudvīpa%} was collected
<div n="lb">together (XIV, {@85@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} appointed {%Bhīmasena%} to
<div n="lb">pay proper honours to the royal guests and to their attendants.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} came with the {%Vṛṣṇis, Baladeva,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about {%Arjuna%} (having heard it from
<div n="lb">a confidential agent of his in {%Dvārakā%}), that he had become
<div n="lb">very much emaciated, and that he was near at hand; he had
<div n="lb">warned against a carnage similar to that at the presenting of
<div n="lb">the {%Arghya,%} and he had especially recommended {%Babhruvāhana%}
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@86@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired of {%Kṛṣṇa%} why {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">had to suffer such hardships in life; {%Kṛṣṇa%} attributes it to
<div n="lb">the elevation of {%Arjuna's%} cheek-bones; {%Draupadī%} looked
<div n="lb">angrily at {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who approved of her love. {%Bhīmasena,%}
<div n="lb">etc., became gratified with {%Arjuna's%} triumphs. A messenger
<div n="lb">announced the arrival of {%Arjuna,%} and was presented with
<div n="lb">large gifts. On the second day {%Arjuna%} entered the city
<div n="lb">(description); people said that he had surpassed even {%Sagara,%}
<div n="lb">etc. {%Arjuna%} saluted {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Babhruvāhana%}
[Page060-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">came with his mother and entered the abode of {%Kuntī%}
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@87@}); {%Citrāṅgadā%} [and {%Ulūpī%}] saluted {%Pṛthā,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Babhruvāhana%} saluted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">gave him an excellent chariot and steeds, and the others
<div n="lb">likewise gave him presents. On the third day {%Vyāsa%} told
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to commence the sacrifice, and to make the
<div n="lb">{%dakṣiṇā%} threefold. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} underwent the {%dīkṣā.%} The
<div n="lb">sacrifice was duly performed (description); 300 animals were
<div n="lb">tied to the stakes in addition to the horse; this sacrifice was
<div n="lb">honoured by the presence of D.-ṛ., G., Aps., Kp., and Ku.;
<div n="lb">there were the disciples of {%Vyāsa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XIV, {@88@});
<div n="lb">having cooked the other animals, the priests sacrificed the
<div n="lb">horse; after having cut it into pieces (B. cooking), they
<div n="lb">caused {%Draupadī%} to sit near it; then the brahmans cooked its
<div n="lb">marrow; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brothers smelled the sin-
<div n="lb">destroying smoke of that marrow; the limbs (heart, tongue,
<div n="lb">breast, etc., Nīl.) the sixteen {%ṛtvijs%} offered into the fire.
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} and his disciples eulogised {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who gave
<div n="lb">1,000 crores of golden {%niṣkas%} to the brahmans, and the
<div n="lb">whole earth as {%dakṣiṇā%} to {%Vyāsa; Vyāsa%} returned it to him,
<div n="lb">telling him to give the purchasing value instead; {%Yudhiṣ-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṭhira%} said that the {%dakṣiṇā%} for the horse-sacrifice is the
<div n="lb">earth, and that he would enter the woods and tell them to
<div n="lb">divide it into four parts, one for each of the four principal
<div n="lb">priests ({%? cāturhotrapramāṇataḥ;%} PCR. “according to what is
<div n="lb">done in the {%cāturhotra%} sacrifice”); his brothers and {%Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">approved of his words, as did also a voice in the sky;
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} prevailed upon him to retain the earth
<div n="lb">and give away millions of golden coins, trebling the {%dakṣiṇā%}
<div n="lb">for the horse-sacrifice; no other king would be able to
<div n="lb">accomplish what {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} thus did after the manner
<div n="lb">of {%Marutta; Vyāsa%} gave the wealth (the price of the earth)
<div n="lb">to the officiating priests, in four parts, and they distributed
<div n="lb">it among the brahmans, who were also permitted to take the
<div n="lb">ornaments of gold, etc.; the remaining wealth was allotted
<div n="lb">to {%kṣattriyas, Vaiśyas, Śūdras,%} and {%Mlecchas. Vyāsa%} gave
<div n="lb">away his own share to {%Kuntī,%} who devoted it to various
<div n="lb">meritorious acts. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} performed the final sacrificial
<div n="lb">bath, and dismissed the kings, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), with proper honours
<div n="lb">and gifts. There were oceans of wine of different kinds, etc.
<div n="lb">(description); people of different realms speak of this sacrifice
<div n="lb">to this day. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} entered his capital (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@89@}).—§ 786: {%Janamejaya%} said: Tell me of any wonderful
<div n="lb">incident that occurred in the sacrifice of my grandfather.
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} related how a mongoose disparaged the
<div n="lb">sacrifice: Nakulākhyāna {%(b);%} then the mongoose dis-
<div n="lb">appeared, and the brahmans returned home. “Thou shouldst
<div n="lb">not think highly of sacrifice; millions of Ṛ. have ascended to
<div n="lb">Heaven with the sole aid of their penances; abstention from
<div n="lb">injury, contentment, proper conduct, sincerity, penances, self-
<div n="lb">restraint, truthfulness, and gifts are each equal in point of
<div n="lb">merit to sacrifice” (XIV, {@90@}). Seeing that kings are given
<div n="lb">to sacrifice, M.-ṛ. to penance, and learned brahmans to
<div n="lb">tranquillity, etc., {%Janamejaya%} cannot but think that nothing
<div n="lb">can be compared with the result of sacrifices, since {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">obtained the sovereignty over the gods by his many sacrifices;
<div n="lb">and when {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma,%} and {%Arjuna%} resembled {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">“why did then that mongoose depreciate {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">horse-sacrifice?” {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Formerly, when
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} was performing a sacrifice the Ṛ. felt compassion on
<div n="lb">the animals, and said to {%Indra%} that the slaughter of animals
<div n="lb">in sacrifices had not been ordained; according to the [true]
<div n="lb">scriptural ordinances the sacrifice should be performed with
[Page060-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">seeds of grain which had been kept for three years. As
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} did not accept their words, a great dispute arose;
<div n="lb">they referred to the {%Cedi%} king {%Vasu,%} who declared that
<div n="lb">a sacrifice may be performed with whichever of the two
<div n="lb">kinds of objects is ready; he therefore had to enter {%Rasātala;%}
<div n="lb">therefore no one should singly be relied upon, when a doubt
<div n="lb">arises, except {%Brahmán;%} gifts made by a sinful person and
<div n="lb">with wealth acquired by unrighteous means became lost;
<div n="lb">while men possessing the wealth of penances acquired great
<div n="lb">merit and proceeded to Heaven, by giving away, to the best
<div n="lb">of their ability, grains of corn, or roots, etc., or water or
<div n="lb">leaves. The same results are also won by compassion,
<div n="lb">{%brahmacarya,%} truthfulness, kindness, fortitude, and forgiveness,
<div n="lb">which are the eternal foundations of eternal righteousness;
<div n="lb">having made gifts of articles lawfully acquired, {%Viśvāmitra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), have attained to high success; those amongst
<div n="lb">brahmans, {%kṣattriyas, vaiśyas,%} and {%Śūdras,%} who betake
<div n="lb">themselves to penances, and who purify themselves by gifts
<div n="lb">and other acts of righteousness, proceed to Heaven (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@91@}). {%Janamejaya%} said: If Heaven is the result of wealth
<div n="lb">acquired by lawful means, please tell me all about it; thou
<div n="lb">hast told me the great result that accrued to the brahman
<div n="lb">living by gleaning grains from his gift of powdered barley.
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} cited the old narrative of what occurred in
<div n="lb">former days at the great sacrifice of {%Agastya (e).%}—Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} explained that the mongoose
<div n="lb">(v. Nakulākhyāna) with a golden head was {%Dharma,%} who
<div n="lb">had been cursed by P., but freed from his curse by disparaging
<div n="lb">himself in the form of {%Yudhiṣṭhira;%} “the mongoose dis-
<div n="lb">appeared there in our very sight” (XIV, {@92@}).
