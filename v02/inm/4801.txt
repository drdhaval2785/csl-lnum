{@Jantūpākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to Jantu”). § 11:
<div n="lb">I, {@2,@} 447.—§ 408 (Tīrthay.): Questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa%} said: King {%Somaka%} had 100 wives, but was a long
<div n="lb">time sonless. At last, when he and his wives were old, he
<div n="lb">got a son {%Jantu,%} whom all the wives surrounded with the
<div n="lb">utmost care. One day when {%Jantu%} had been stung by an ant
<div n="lb">at his hip and cried, {%Somaka,%} afraid of losing him, inquired
<div n="lb">of his {%ṛtvij%} if there were a ceremony by which a man might
<div n="lb">get 100 sons. He was told to sacrifice {%Jantu%} and let his wives
<div n="lb">take a smell of the smoke of his fat; then 100 sons would be
<div n="lb">born to him, and {%Jantu%} himself would be born once more of
<div n="lb">the same mother, with a mark of gold on his back (III, {@127@}).
<div n="lb">The sacrifice was performed notwithstanding the screams of
<div n="lb">the wives, and after ten months 100 sons were born, of
<div n="lb">whom {%Jantu%} was the eldest and most beloved and superior
<div n="lb">in merit, and had that mark of gold. When the {%guru%} and
<div n="lb">{%Somaka%} had died, the {%purohita%} was grilled in a terrible hell
<div n="lb">for having performed that sacrifice, and {%Somaka%} prevailed
<div n="lb">upon {%Dharmarāja%} (who said “one cannot enjoy or suffer for
<div n="lb">another person's acts”) that he should be likewise tormented
[Page353-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">for the same period before he entered the blessed regions.
<div n="lb">Here they (the Pāṇḍavas, etc.) spent six nights (III, {@128@}).
