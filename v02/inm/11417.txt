[{@Vaivasvatopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“story of Manu Vaiva-
<div n="lb">svata”). § 457 (Mārk.). Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} said: The {%maharṣi Manu, Vivasvat's%} son, equal
<div n="lb">to {%Prajāpati%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}), excelled his father and grand-
<div n="lb">father in strength, etc. He practised austerities in {%Badarī,%}
<div n="lb">standing on one foot, etc., for 10,000 years. Once a small
<div n="lb">fish came to him on the banks of the {%Cīriṇī%} and asked his
<div n="lb">protection from the greater fishes. He first reared it in a
<div n="lb">water vessel, and as it grew larger, he carried it to a large
<div n="lb">tank, and thence into the {%Gaṅgā,%} and at last into the ocean.
<div n="lb">The fish, saying that the world was about to be destroyed,
<div n="lb">caused him to build a strong ship with a long rope and
<div n="lb">ascend it with the seven {%ṛṣis%} and the seeds that were
<div n="lb">enumerated by the {%brahmans%} of old. The fish then appeared
<div n="lb">and was recognized by a horn, to which {%Manu%} tied the noose.
<div n="lb">And, while there was water everywhere, the fish dragged
<div n="lb">the boat through the flood for many years, until, advised by
<div n="lb">the fish, {%Manu%} tied the ship to the highest peak of {%Himavat,%}
<div n="lb">thence called {%Naubandhana.%} The fish told him that he was
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} and caused {%Manu%} to create (again) by austerities
<div n="lb">all creatures with gods, {%Asuras,%} and men. This is the
<div n="lb">{%Mātsyakaṃ Purāṇaṃ%} (III, {@187@}).
