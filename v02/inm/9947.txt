<div n="lb">(cf. Rāmopākhyānap.). {%Rāvaṇa%} caused {%Mārīca%} to entice away
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} by assuming the shape of a deer with golden horns and
<div n="lb">a golden skin. Seeing this deer {%Rāma%} pursued it, like {%Rudra%}
<div n="lb">pursuing the stellar deer {%(tārāmṛgaṃ)%} in days of yore; struck
<div n="lb">with {%Rāma's%} arrow {%Mārīca,%} imitating {%Rāma's%} voice cried out,
<div n="lb">calling upon {%Sītā%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa. Lakṣmaṇa,%} thinking that
<div n="lb">nobody was able to slay {%Rāma,%} at first inclined to stay there
<div n="lb">and protect {%Sītā,%} but as she suspected him, he set out on the
<div n="lb">track of {%Rāma.%} Then {%Rāvaṇa,%} in the guise of an ascetic, with
<div n="lb">shaven head and with a {%kuṇḍala%} and a triple staff, came to the
<div n="lb">hermitage and began to carry away {%Sītā%} to {%Laṅkā;%} on his
<div n="lb">way he was seen by the vulture {%Jaṭāyu%} (III, {@278@}).
