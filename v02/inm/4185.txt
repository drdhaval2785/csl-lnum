{@Goharaṇaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the robbing of
<div n="lb">the kine of Virāṭa,” the 55th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
<div n="lb">cf. Gograhaṇa). § 552: Meanwhile the spies of Duryodhana
<div n="lb">returned to Hāstinapura and informed Duryodhana, who was
<div n="lb">sitting with Droṇa, Karṇa, Kṛpa, Bhīṣma, his brothers, and
<div n="lb">the Trigartas, that they had not found out the Pāṇḍavas, but
<div n="lb">that Kīcaka {%(b)%} had been slain (IV, {@25@}). Kārṇa and Duḥśāsana
<div n="lb">proposed that the other spies should be sent (IV, {@26@}).
<div n="lb">Droṇa said: “People like the Pāṇḍavas never perish, let the
<div n="lb">abode which the Pāṇḍavas are to occupy now be settled”
<div n="lb">(IV, {@27@}). Bhīṣma applauded Droṇa (IV, {@28@}). Kṛpa
<div n="lb">recommended precautions (IV, {@29@}). The Trigarta king,
<div n="lb">Suśarman, supported by Karṇa, proposed to invade the city
<div n="lb">of Virāṭa and to rob his kine and wealth, and thus to take
<div n="lb">revenge for the invasions of the Matsyas headed by Kīcaka.
<div n="lb">Duryodhana caused Duḥśāsana to array their forces. Suśarman
<div n="lb">set out towards the south-east on the seventh day of the dark
<div n="lb">fortnight, and the Kauravas on the eighth day (IV, {@30@}).
<div n="lb">After Kīcaka had been slain, Virāṭa began to rest his hopes
<div n="lb">on the Pāṇḍavas. His brothers, Śatānīka and Madirākṣa,
<div n="lb">and the king himself, and Sūryadatta and Śaṅkha, the eldest
<div n="lb">son of Virāṭa, put on their coats of mail. Virāṭa also caused
<div n="lb">Śatānīka to order chariots for Kaṅka, Vallava, Tantripāla,
<div n="lb">and Dāmagranthi (i.e. Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena, Nakula, and
<div n="lb">Sahadeva in disguise) (IV, {@31@}). The Matsyas overtook the
<div n="lb">Trigartas shortly before sunset. Śatānīka and Viśālākṣa
<div n="lb">penetrated into the heart of the Trigarta host. Virāṭa, with
<div n="lb">Sūryadatta in his van and Madirākṣa in his rear, began
<div n="lb">a single combat from chariots against Suśarman (IV, {@32@}).
<div n="lb">The night interrupted the battle for a while, but it began
<div n="lb">once more when the moon arose. Suśarman and his younger
<div n="lb">brother made Virāṭa prisoner, and the Matsyas began to fly;
<div n="lb">Bhīma would uproot a tree, but was prevented by Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">lest the people should recognize them; then Bhīma, with
<div n="lb">Nakula and Sahadeva as protectors of his wheels, rushed
<div n="lb">against Suśarman, and the Matsya warriors, Virāṭa's son, and
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira, etc., followed him; the charioteer of Suśarman
<div n="lb">was dragged to the ground. Madirāśva came to the aid of
<div n="lb">Bhīma. Virāṭa leapt down from the chariot of Suśarman,
[Page310-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">seizing the mace of the latter, and ran in pursuit of him;
<div n="lb">Suśarman was seized by Bhīma, but set free by Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">(IV, {@33@}). The Pāṇḍavas passed the night on the field of
<div n="lb">battle honoured by Virāṭa. As proposed by Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">Virāṭa ordered messengers to proclaim the victory in the city.
<div n="lb">The messengers repaired to the city that very night, and
<div n="lb">at sunrise they proclaimed the victory at the city gates
<div n="lb">(IV, {@34@}). Meanwhile Duryodhana, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), invaded the
<div n="lb">Matsya country and took away the kine. Hearing this,
<div n="lb">Bhūmiñjaya (i.e. Uttara), who had been left by the king in
<div n="lb">the empty city (IV, {@35@}), and whose charioteer had been slain
<div n="lb">in a great battle, followed the advice of Kṛṣṇa (who had
<div n="lb">been instigated by Arjuna) and sent Uttarā (IV, {@36@}), who
<div n="lb">prevailed upon Bṛhannalā (= Arjuna in disguise) to become
<div n="lb">the charioteer of Uttara. Uttarā and her maidens asked
<div n="lb">Arjuna to bring fine clothes for their dolls when he had
<div n="lb">vanquished the Kurus (IV, {@37@}). Seeing the host of the
<div n="lb">Kurus, Uttara became agitated with fear and jumped down
<div n="lb">from the chariot and began to flee, but was seized by Arjuna
<div n="lb">and made to hold the reins, while Arjuna had to fight (IV,
<div n="lb">{@38@}). Bhīṣma, Droṇa, etc., suspected the comer to be Arjuna,
<div n="lb">and many portents were explained by Droṇa in that sense.
<div n="lb">Karṇa blamed Droṇa, and Duryodhana said that if it were
<div n="lb">Arjuna the Pāṇḍavas must go into exile for twelve more
<div n="lb">years (IV, {@39@}). Having reached the {%śamī%} tree, Arjuna ordered
<div n="lb">Uttara to fetch the weapons of the Pāṇḍavas, including
<div n="lb">Gāṇḍīva, which were deposited there (IV, {@40@}). Believing
<div n="lb">that a corpse had been tied up in the tree, Uttara refused, but
<div n="lb">as Arjuna said: “There are only bows in that tree and no
<div n="lb">corpse,” he climbed up and unwrapped and untied the bows
<div n="lb">(IV, {@41@}). Arjuna explained to him to whom the different
<div n="lb">bows belonged, first mentioning the Gāṇḍīva (<lang n="greek"></lang>), which is
<div n="lb">honoured by the gods, the Dānavas, and the Gandharvas
<div n="lb">(IV, {@42—43@}). He then revealed to Uttara that they were
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍavas and confirmed it by telling his ten names (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(IV, {@44@}). Arjuna took off the bracelets from his arms, etc.,
<div n="lb">recalled to his mind all his weapons, and twanged the Gāṇḍīva
<div n="lb">with a dreadful sound, whence the Kurus knew that he was
<div n="lb">Arjuna, then he comforted Uttara by mentioning his former
<div n="lb">exploits (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and his preceptors in arms (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (IV, {@45@}). Having
<div n="lb">taken down the banner with the figure of a lion he set up his
<div n="lb">own flagstaff bearing the figure of an ape with a lion's tail,
<div n="lb">which was a celestial illusion {%(māyā)%} contrived by Viśva-
<div n="lb">karman himself, for as soon as he thought of the gift of Agni,
<div n="lb">Agni ordered the superhuman creatures to take their usual
<div n="lb">place on that banner, which then fell down from the air on
<div n="lb">his chariot (read {%rathe%} with B.). Droṇa concluded from
<div n="lb">various omens that it was Arjuna (IV, {@46@}). Duryodhana
<div n="lb">repeated to Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and Kṛpa, his and Karṇa's
<div n="lb">opinion, that Arjuna must have broken his pledge, and asked
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma to calculate the time. Karṇa blamed Droṇa for
<div n="lb">praising Arjuna (IV, {@47@}), and declared that he would throw
<div n="lb">Arjuna down from his chariot that very day (IV, {@48@}).
<div n="lb">Kṛpa blamed Karṇa and warned him from fighting alone with
<div n="lb">Arjuna, mentioning his exploits (<lang n="greek"></lang>); they ought all to fight
<div n="lb">with Arjuna and not Karṇa alone (IV, {@49@}). Aśvatthāman
<div n="lb">blamed Karṇa for his vain boast and declared that he would
<div n="lb">not fight with Arjuna (IV, {@50@}). Bhīṣma tried to mediate
<div n="lb">between Aśvatthāman and Kṛpa on one side and Karṇa on
<div n="lb">the other side; he was of opinion that fight they must, and
<div n="lb">therefore this was not the time for quarrel. “The Brāhmāstra
<div n="lb">and the Vedas are never to be seen combined anywhere else
<div n="lb">than in Droṇa (and Aśvatthāman).” He was supported by
[Page310-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman and Duryodhana. Droṇa said; “Let such
<div n="lb">arrangements be made that Arjuna may not be able to
<div n="lb">approach Duryodhana in battle, and that Duryodhana may
<div n="lb">not be captured by the foe” (IV, {@51@}). Having calculated
<div n="lb">the time (“an excess of five months and twelve nights in
<div n="lb">thirteen years”), Bhīṣma declared that the Pāṇḍavas had
<div n="lb">not broken the pledge. Duryodhana said: “I will not give
<div n="lb">back the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas.” Bhīṣma proposed that
<div n="lb">Duryodhana should proceed towards the capital with one-
<div n="lb">fourth of the army, and that one-fourth should escort the
<div n="lb">kine, while he, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman, and Kṛpa should
<div n="lb">withstand the foes. This proposal was accepted; Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">placed Droṇa in the centre, Aśvatthāman on the left wing,
<div n="lb">Kṛpa on the right wing, and Karṇa in the van, and would
<div n="lb">himself stand in the rear (IV, {@52@}). Droṇa recognized the
<div n="lb">top of Arjuna's banner, etc. Arjuna directed Uttara to the
<div n="lb">spot where Duryodhana was; the soldiers became so con-
<div n="lb">founded that they could not even fly, and the kine turned
<div n="lb">back along the southern road (IV, {@53@}). As Arjuna was
<div n="lb">advancing towards Duryodhana the Kurus fell upon him,
<div n="lb">especially Karṇa, who was supported by Citrasena, Saṅgrā-
<div n="lb">majit (the brother of Karṇa), Śatrusaha, Jaya, and Vikarṇa;
<div n="lb">Vikarṇa fled; Śatruntapa and many others were slain by
<div n="lb">Arjuna, so also Saṅgrāmajit; at last Karṇa took to flight
<div n="lb">(IV, {@54@}). Duryodhana, etc., attacked Arjuna; Arjuna shot
<div n="lb">at Droṇa, Duḥsaha, Aśvatthāman, Duḥśāsana, and Kṛpa, and
<div n="lb">wounded Bhīṣma, Duryodhana, and Karṇa. Then Arjuna
<div n="lb">described to Uttara the banners, etc., of Kṛpa, Droṇa,
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman, Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Bhīṣma (IV, {@55@}).
<div n="lb">Indra, the gods, the Viśvas, the Aśvins, the Maruts, the Yakṣas,
<div n="lb">the Gandharvas, the Mahoragas, the Nāgas, the Rākṣasas, the
<div n="lb">serpents, the Pitṛs, and the maharṣis came to see the combat,
<div n="lb">likewise, sitting on the chariot of Indra, king Vasumanas, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); also Agni, Śiva, Soma, Varuṇa, Prajāpati, Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ,
<div n="lb">Kubera, Yama, Alambuṣa, Ugrasena, Tumburu, etc., came
<div n="lb">there (IV, {@56@}). Arjuna attacked Kṛpa, announced his name,
<div n="lb">and blew the Devadatta; at last Kṛpa was led away by his
<div n="lb">soldiers (IV, {@57@}). Droṇa attacked Arjuna; Arjuna said:
<div n="lb">“I will not strike thee unless thou strikest me first”; with
<div n="lb">his own weapons Arjuna baffled the Aindra, Vāyavya, and
<div n="lb">Āgneya weapons, which were shot by Droṇa; a voice was
<div n="lb">heard in the sky applauding Droṇa; then Aśvatthāman
<div n="lb">attacked Arjuna, which gave Droṇa an opportunity to leave
<div n="lb">the field (IV, {@58@}). Aśvatthāman cut off the string of the
<div n="lb">Gāṇḍīva and was applauded by the gods, and by Droṇa,
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma, Karṇa, and Kṛpa. Arjuna attached a fresh string
<div n="lb">to the Gāṇḍīva. As Aśvatthāman's arrows became exhausted
<div n="lb">Karṇa attacked Arjuna (IV, {@59@}), who challenged him to
<div n="lb">a single combat and rebuked him, because he had fled after
<div n="lb">the slaughter of his younger brother. At last Karṇa,
<div n="lb">wounded, fled in a northern direction (IV, {@60@}). Then
<div n="lb">Arjuna ordered Uttara to take him to Bhīṣma; Uttara
<div n="lb">became afraid and was comforted by Arjuna {%(d),%} who
<div n="lb">enumerated some of his exploits and weapons. Duḥśāsana,
<div n="lb">Vikarṇa, Duḥsaha, and Viviṃśati rushed towards Arjuna;
<div n="lb">Duḥśāsana fled; Vikarṇa fell down; Duḥsaha and Viviṃśati
<div n="lb">were taken away by their warriors (IV, {@61@}). At last the
<div n="lb">Kauravas fled (IV, {@62@}); Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Duḥśāsana
<div n="lb">attempted in vain to defeat Arjuna (IV, {@63@}). Then Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">and Arjuna fought with the Prājāpatya, Aindra, Āgneya,
<div n="lb">Raudra, Kaubera, Vāruṇa, Yāmya, and Vāyavya weapons;
<div n="lb">the Gandharva Citrasena showed the two combatants to
<div n="lb">Indra, who showered celestial flowers down upon them;
[Page311-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">at last Bhīṣma, wounded, lost consciousness and was led
<div n="lb">away by his charioteer (IV, {@64@}). Duryodhana and then
<div n="lb">Vikarṇa attacked Arjuna; Vikarṇa ran back and ascended
<div n="lb">the chariot of Viviṃśati; Duryodhana was wounded and fled,
<div n="lb">and so did all the warriors (IV, {@65@}). Stung by the censure
<div n="lb">of Arjuna, Duryodhana returned, and Karṇa, Bhīṣma, Droṇa,
<div n="lb">Kṛpa, Viviṃśati, and Duḥśāsana rushed forwards to protect
<div n="lb">Duryodhana. Arjuna employed the weapon Sammohana
<div n="lb">which he had obtained from Indra, and blew his conch
<div n="lb">so that the Kurus were deprived of their senses. Then he
<div n="lb">caused Uttara to take away the white garments of Droṇa and
<div n="lb">Kṛpa, the yellow ones of Karṇa, and the blue ones of
<div n="lb">Duryodhana and Aśvatthāman, but not those of Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb">because he had not been stupefied. Arjuna wounded Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb">who told Duryodhana to go back to his city, which they all
<div n="lb">did; Arjuna followed them for a while and worshipped
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Aśvatthāman, and Kṛpa; then he, with
<div n="lb">an arrow, broke the crown of Duryodhana and blew the
<div n="lb">Devadatta. Then he ordered Uttara to turn back. The gods
<div n="lb">returned to their respective abodes (IV, {@66@}). A large
<div n="lb">number of Kuru soldiers issuing from the forest stood before
<div n="lb">Arjuna with joined palms and were spared. Arjuna said to
<div n="lb">Uttara: “Do not eulogize the Pāṇḍavas, but say that the
<div n="lb">feat is thy own.” Then he replaced the weapons on the {%śamī%}
<div n="lb">tree; the monkey ascended to the sky, together with the other
<div n="lb">creatures on the flagstaff, the illusion {%(māyā)%} melted away,
<div n="lb">and Uttara's own banner was replaced upon the chariot.
<div n="lb">Arjuna entered the city in the guise of Bṛhannalā, having
<div n="lb">sent the cowherds to announce the victory (IV, {@67@}). Virāṭa
<div n="lb">entered his city, followed by the four Pāṇḍavas, and dispatched
<div n="lb">an army to protect Uttara, though Yudhiṣṭhira said that,
<div n="lb">protected by Bṛhannalā, he was able to vanquish even the
<div n="lb">gods, the Asuras, the Siddhas, and the Yakṣas. Meanwhile
<div n="lb">the messengers of Uttara came and Virāṭa ordered the
<div n="lb">highways to be decorated, etc., and began to play at dice
<div n="lb">with Yudhiṣṭhira, who again repeatedly praised Bṛhannalā.
<div n="lb">Virāṭa struck Yudhiṣṭhira with a die, but the blood was
<div n="lb">prevented from falling on the ground and was washed away
<div n="lb">by Kṛṣṇā, who also, at the injunction of Yudhiṣṭhira, let
<div n="lb">Uttara enter alone, that Bṛhannalā should not see him
<div n="lb">bleeding. Uttara prevailed upon Virāṭa to ask Yudhiṣṭhira's
<div n="lb">pardon. When the bleeding had stopped, Bṛhannalā
<div n="lb">entered (IV, {@68@}). Uttara said: “All this has been
<div n="lb">accomplished by a {%devaputra%} (‘son of a deity’) who then
<div n="lb">disappeared.” Arjuna gave to Uttarā the garments he had
<div n="lb">brought (IV, {@69@}).
