[{@Mokṣadharmaparvan@}]¦ (“the section containing the
<div n="lb">rule for attaining to emancipation from transmigration,”
<div n="lb">the 90th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Mokṣadharma).
<div n="lb">§ 659: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the duties in the four
<div n="lb">stages of life; {%Bhīṣma%} indicated the attainment of emanci-
<div n="lb">pation as the highest of all duties. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} how grief might be overcome; {%Bhīṣma%} related
<div n="lb">the old story of the conversation between a {%brahman%} and
<div n="lb">king {%Senajit,%} burning with sorrow on account of the death
<div n="lb">of his son; dissociation from the world is the grand method
<div n="lb">of overcoming grief. The {%brahman%} cited the verses sung by
<div n="lb">{%Piṅgalā%} (a fallen woman who was denied the company of
<div n="lb">her lover through an accident) about the manner in which
<div n="lb">she had acquired eternal merit; freedom from hope and
<div n="lb">desire is felicity. King {%Senajit%} experienced delight and
<div n="lb">became very happy (XII, {@174@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} as to what constitutes the highest good that man
<div n="lb">should seek in view of the transient character of time;
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of a discourse between
<div n="lb">a {%brahman,%} who was devoted to the study of the {%Vedas,%}
<div n="lb">and his son {%Medhāvin,%} who was well conversant with the
<div n="lb">religion of emancipation, and acquainted also with the affairs
<div n="lb">of the world, on the uncertainty of life and the mutability
<div n="lb">of all things save {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@175@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">how happiness and misery come to the rich and the poor;
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of what was sung by
<div n="lb">{%Śampāka;%} who had achieved emancipation, told in former
<div n="lb">times by a poor {%brahman%} rendered miserable by a bad wife,
<div n="lb">etc.; the faults of prosperity; in renunciation is the highest
<div n="lb">good of men (XII, {@176@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what a man
<div n="lb">must do to find happiness if he be poor. {%Bhīṣma%} explained
<div n="lb">who is a happy man, and related the old narrative of
<div n="lb">what {%Maṅki%} had sung when freed from attachments; {%Maṅki%}
<div n="lb">found that he was assiduously doomed to disappointments;
<div n="lb">at last, with a remnant of his property, he purchased a couple
<div n="lb">of young bulls with a yoke; a camel ran away with them
<div n="lb">upon its neck; {%Maṅki's%} observations, quoting {%Śuka:%} desire
<div n="lb">is fraught with sorrow (XII, {@177@}). In this connection
<div n="lb">reference is made to the old verses sung by the {%Videha%} king
<div n="lb">{%Janaka,%} who had attained to tranquillity of soul: “even if the
<div n="lb">whole of {%Mithilā%} be consumed in a conflagration I shall incur
<div n="lb">no loss.” Discourse between king {%Nāhuṣa%} (i.e. Yayāti) and
<div n="lb">Ṛ. {%Bodhya%} about freedom from attachment; {%Bodhya's%} six
<div n="lb">preceptors ({%Piṅgalā,%} etc.) (XII, {@178@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished
<div n="lb">to know by what conduct a person may succeed in this
<div n="lb">world and attain to an excellent end. {%Bhīṣma%} related
<div n="lb">the old story of the discourse between king {%Prahlāda%} and
<div n="lb">a sage who had adopted the {%Ājagara%} vow: the indifference
<div n="lb">of the latter to all worldly objects in view of the inevitability
<div n="lb">of death (XII, {@179@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked which of these,
<div n="lb">viz. kinsmen, or acts, or wealth, or wisdom, should be the
<div n="lb">refuge of man. {%Bhīṣma%} answered that wisdom should be
<div n="lb">the refuge, instancing {%Bali,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and related the old story
<div n="lb">of the discourse between {%Indra%} and {%Kāśyapa,%} a Ṛ.'s son, who
<div n="lb">was brought to the ground by a {%vaiśya%} negligently driving
<div n="lb">his chariot, and who in despair resolved to end his life; {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">appeared to him in the form of a jackal and proved to him
<div n="lb">the superiority of his status as a human being and a brahman;
<div n="lb">not to yield to the instigation of the senses constitutes happi-
<div n="lb">ness; “thou dost not regret {%(smārasi)%} wine {%(Vāruṇī)%} nor the
[Page482-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%latvāka%} fowls; there is no drink and no food more delicious
<div n="lb">than these;…the vilest {%Pukkasa%} or {%Cāṇḍāla%} never wishes
<div n="lb">to give up his life.” {%Kāśyapa%} gave up the desire of ending
<div n="lb">his life; he knew the jackal to be {%Indra,%} worshipped
<div n="lb">him, and returned home (XII, {@180@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">whether gifts, sacrifices, penances, and dutiful services to
<div n="lb">preceptors are productive of merit. {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on
<div n="lb">righteousness and sin and their respective consequences
<div n="lb">on life (XII, {@181@}).—§ 660: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about
<div n="lb">him who has created the universe and to whom it returns
<div n="lb">when dissolution comes. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative
<div n="lb">of the sacred words that M.-ṛ. {%Bhṛgu%} uttered in reply to the
<div n="lb">questions of {%Bharadvāja,%} on the {%Kailāsa%} summit, explaining
<div n="lb">to him the cosmogony, i.e. {%Bhṛgu-Bharadvāja-saṃvāda(b)%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@182—192@}).—§ 661: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Bhīṣma%} about
<div n="lb">the ordinances about conduct. {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on the
<div n="lb">characteristics of the wicked and the good (“{%Sūrya%} should
<div n="lb">always be worshipped,” etc.), and the duties that all men
<div n="lb">should practise, quoting D.-ṛ. {%Nārada;%} “one who has
<div n="lb">abstained from meat should not take meat even if it be
<div n="lb">sanctified with {%mantras%} from the {%Yajurveda%}” (XII, {@193@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on {%adhyātma;%}
<div n="lb">the nature of the three attributes of Goodness, Passion,
<div n="lb">and Darkness; the distinction between matter {%(sattva)%}
<div n="lb">and soul {%(kṣetrajña);%} the highest end to be obtained
<div n="lb">is emancipation (XII, {@194@}). {%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the
<div n="lb">four kinds of {%yoga;%} “M.-ṛ., obtaining a knowledge of
<div n="lb">the same, attain to eternal success {%(siddhiṃ)%} even here”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@195@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired after the fruits of the
<div n="lb">silent recitation of sacred {%mantras; Bhīṣma%} wanted to recite
<div n="lb">the old narrative of the discourse between {%Yama,%} a {%brahman,%}
<div n="lb">and Time (v. {%infra,%} ch. {@199@}); on {%Sāṅkhya,%} “otherwise called
<div n="lb">the {%Vedānta,%}” and {%Yoga, Bráhman,%} etc. (XII, {@196@}).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the other aims of silent
<div n="lb">reciters; {%Bhīṣma%} indicated the different aims realized by
<div n="lb">different kinds of reciters (XII, {@197@}); the nature of the
<div n="lb">hell into which reciters may sink; the regions of Lp., etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), are hells compared to the region of the Supreme Soul,
<div n="lb">i.e. to emancipation (XII, {@198@}).—§ 662: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">wished to hear in full the dispute between Time, {%Mṛtyu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yama, Sūrya's%} son {%Ikṣvāku,%} and a {%brahman,%} referred to
<div n="lb">above (v. ch. {@196@}); {%Bhīṣma%} related this old story, i.e.
<div n="lb">{%Jāpakopākhyāna(b)%} (XII, {@199—200@}).—§ 663: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">inquired about the results of the {%yoga%} of knowledge, of all
<div n="lb">the {%Vedas,%} and of observances and vows; {%Bhīṣma%} related
<div n="lb">the old discourse between {%Manu Prajāpati%} and his disciple
<div n="lb">M.-ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati%} (the foremost of D.ṛ.), in days of old, who
<div n="lb">had studied the {%Ṛcs,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bṛhaspati%} asked how an
<div n="lb">embodied being departs from one body and attains to another;
<div n="lb">acts result from the desire of obtaining happiness and avoiding
<div n="lb">misery; the efforts for the acquisition of knowledge arise
<div n="lb">from the desire of avoiding both happiness and misery; it is
<div n="lb">by avoiding acts that one succeeds in entering into {%Bráhman;%}
<div n="lb">the nature of {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@201@}); continuation of {%Manu's%}
<div n="lb">discourse on the nature of emancipation and the soul; the
<div n="lb">soul takes its character from the body; how the soul leaving
<div n="lb">one body enters into another (XII, {@202@}); though invisible,
<div n="lb">the soul exists (XII, {@203@}); continuation of {%Manu's%} dis-
<div n="lb">course, explaining how the soul may be seen (XII, {@204@});
<div n="lb">continuation of {%Manu's%} discourse, explaining how grief may
<div n="lb">be avoided; how {%Bráhman%} may be attained (XII, {@205@});
<div n="lb">abstention from acts is the highest religion (XII, {@206@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 664: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Bhīṣma%} about the nature of
[Page482-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">the Supreme Deity ({%Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)). {%Bhīṣma's%}
<div n="lb">discourse, which he had heard from {%Rāma Jāmadagnya,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), on the nature of {%Nārāyaṇa%} or {%Govinda,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the
<div n="lb">{%Asura Madhu (b); Brahmán's%} seven will-born sons (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Madhusūdana (Kṛṣṇa)%} created day and night,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then from his mouth he created 100 {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">from his arms 100 {%kṣatriyas,%} from his thighs 100 {%vaiśyas,%}
<div n="lb">and from his feet 100 {%śūdras,%} and then he made {%Dhātṛ%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Brahmán,%} PCR.) the lord and ruler of all created
<div n="lb">beings; {%Brahmán%} also became the expositor of the knowledge
<div n="lb">of the {%Vedas; Virūpākṣa%} he made the ruler of the spirits
<div n="lb">and ghosts and {%Mātṛs; Yama%} the ruler of P. [and] all sinful
<div n="lb">men; {%Kubera%} the lord of all treasures; {%Varuṇa%} the lord of
<div n="lb">the waters and of all aquatic animals; {%Indra%} the lord of the
<div n="lb">gods. In those times men lived as long as they chose,
<div n="lb">without any fear of {%Yama;%} offspring was begotten by
<div n="lb">a fiat of the will. In the {%Tretā%} age children were begotten
<div n="lb">by touch alone. In the {%Dvāpara%} age sexual intercourse
<div n="lb">originated. In the {%Kali%} age men have come to marry and
<div n="lb">live in pairs. The sinful creatures of the earth, born in
<div n="lb">the southern region and called {%Andhrakas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); in the
<div n="lb">northern region, the {%Yaunas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); their practices are
<div n="lb">similar to those of {%Cāṇḍālas%} and ravens and vultures; in the
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta%} age they were nowhere on earth; it is from the {%Tretā%}
<div n="lb">that they have had their origin; when the terrible interval
<div n="lb">[between the {%Tretā%} and the {%Dvāpara%}] came, the {%kṣatriyas%}
<div n="lb">engaged in battle. D.-ṛ. {%Nārada,%} that observer of all
<div n="lb">the worlds, has said that {%Kṛṣṇa%} is the supreme god
<div n="lb">(XII, {@207@}).—§ 665: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked who are the first
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpatis,%} and who the great {%Ṛṣis,%} and in which direction
<div n="lb">they dwell. {%Bhīṣma%} enumerated {%Brahmán's%} seven sons
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), mentioned in the {%Purāṇas%} as seven {%Brahmáns.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpatis%} that came after these are: (<lang n="greek"></lang>) in {%Atri's%} race:
<div n="lb">{%Prācīnabarhis (Brahmayoniḥ sanātanaḥ)%} > the ten {%Prācetasaḥ >%}
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati Dakṣa%} or {%Ka; (b) Marīci%} had one son {%Kaśyapa%} or
<div n="lb">{%Ariṣṭanemi. Atri%} had another son born of his loins, the
<div n="lb">handsome and princely {%Soma;%} he performed penances for
<div n="lb">1,000 celestial {%yugas. Aryaman%} and his sons were rulers
<div n="lb">and creators of all creatures. {%Śaśabindu%} had 10,000 wives,
<div n="lb">and begot upon each of them 1,000 sons, who would call
<div n="lb">none {%Prajāpati%} save themselves; the ancient {%(purāṇāḥ)%}
<div n="lb">brahmans call creatures {%(prajāṃ) Śāśabindavī;%} this race
<div n="lb">became the progenitor of the {%Vṛṣṇi%} race. “These that
<div n="lb">I have named are the illustrious {%Prajāpatis.%}” The deities
<div n="lb">are: the twelve {%Ādityas%} (all sprung from {%Kaśyapa%}) (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the
<div n="lb">{%Aśvins%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (the sons of {%Mārtaṇḍa—aṣṭamasya%}); these were
<div n="lb">first called the gods and the two classes of Pitṛs {%(? te ca%}
<div n="lb">{%pūrvaṃ surāś ceti dvividhāḥ pitaraḥ smṛtāḥ). Tvaṣṭṛ's%} son
<div n="lb">was the handsome {%Viśvarūpa; Ajaikapād,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) [are the
<div n="lb">eleven {%Rudras%}]; these were reckoned as gods at the time
<div n="lb">of the {%Prajāpati Manu;%} the {%Siddhas%} and {%Sādhyas,%} different
<div n="lb">as to perfect conduct and youth; the {%Ṛbhus%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Maruts%} were also classes of gods (C. {%devānāṃ cādito gaṇāḥ;%}
<div n="lb">B. {%codito gaṇaḥ%}); thus are enumerated the {%Viśvedevās%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Aśvins.%} Amongst them the {%Ādityas%} are {%kṣatriyas,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Maruts vaiśyas,%} the {%Aśvins%} (engaged in penances) {%śūdras;%}
<div n="lb">the gods [called] {%Aṅgirasaḥ%} are {%brahmans.%} The person who
<div n="lb">at morn recites the names of these deities becomes cleansed
<div n="lb">of all his sins. {%Yavakrīta,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and {%Kaṇva,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), all
<div n="lb">reside in the east; {%Unmuca,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the south; {%Uṣaṅgu,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the west; {%Ātreya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the north. These
<div n="lb">are the witnesses [of the universe] and the creators of all
<div n="lb">the worlds. By reciting these names one is cleansed of all
[Page483-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">one's sins; by sojourning to these points a person becomes
<div n="lb">cleansed of all his sins and succeeds in returning home in
<div n="lb">safety (XII, {@208@}).—§ 666: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about
<div n="lb">the reason of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} assuming the form of an animal.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said that formerly, while hunting, he arrived
<div n="lb">at the hermitage of {%Mārkaṇḍeya,%} where he was honoured
<div n="lb">by Ṛ., and M.-ṛ. {%Kaśyapa%} related: In former days Dā. and
<div n="lb">As. {%Naraka,%} etc., oppressed D. and D.-ṛ.; the earth seemed
<div n="lb">to be oppressed with a heavy weight. The {%Ādityas%} repaired
<div n="lb">to {%Brahmán,%} who said that {%Viṣṇu%} in the form of a boar would
<div n="lb">slay the As. Some time afterwards {%Viṣṇu%} (having {%yoga%} for
<div n="lb">his soul, etc.) penetrated into the earth (into {%Rasātala%}) in the
<div n="lb">form of a boar, and uttering tremendous roars {%(nādena),%}
<div n="lb">at which even D. with {%Indra%} became terror-stricken, pierced
<div n="lb">the As. with his hoofs, etc., whence he came to be called
<div n="lb">{%Sanātana. Brahmán%} explained to the gods that he was
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} the Creator of all things, the foremost of {%yogins,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">he from whose navel the primeval lotus had sprung, etc.
<div n="lb">(XII, {@209@}).—§ 667: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the nature
<div n="lb">of that high {%yoga%} by which emancipation may be attained.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of a discourse between a
<div n="lb">preceptor (the foremost of Ṛ.) and his disciple on emancipation;
<div n="lb">on {%adhyātma%} (undisclosed in the very {%Vedas%}); {%Vāsudeva%} is the
<div n="lb">supreme [cause] of the universe; he is the origin of the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas (viśvasya brahmaṇo mukhaṃ),%} etc.; he created P., D.,
<div n="lb">Ṛ., Y., Rā., N., As., and men, etc.; having reduced every-
<div n="lb">thing into non-existence, he once more, in the beginning
<div n="lb">of a {%yuga,%} creates {%Prakṛti;%} at the end of every {%yuga%} the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas%} and all other scriptures disappear; in consequence
<div n="lb">of the grace of {%Svayambhū,%} M.-ṛ., through their penances,
<div n="lb">first re-acquire the {%Vedas%} and {%Itihāsas; Svayambhū%} knows
<div n="lb">the {%Vedas, Bṛhaspati%} their {%Aṅgas, Bhārgava%} (i.e. Śukra) the
<div n="lb">{%Nītiśāstra%} (science of morality, etc.), {%Nārada%} the {%Gāndharva%}
<div n="lb">(the science of music), {%Bharadvāja%} the science of arms
<div n="lb">{%(Dhanurgrahaṃ), Gārgya%} the history of the celestial Ṛṣis
<div n="lb">{%(devarṣicaritaṃ), Kṛṣṇātreya%} medicine, diverse other teachers
<div n="lb">the philosophical systems ({%Nyāyatantrāṇi,%} cf. Nīl.). Neither
<div n="lb">D. nor Ṛ. were [originally] able to apprehend {%Bráhman;%}
<div n="lb">only {%Nārāyaṇa%} knew it; from him Ṛ., the foremost D., As.,
<div n="lb">and R.-ṛ. of old learnt it. Etymology of {%Puruṣa (navadvāraṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%puraṃ vyāpya śete,%} v. 7679) (XII, {@210@}). Continuation of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse explaining how the inclinations and
<div n="lb">instincts of a past life run towards the soul in a new
<div n="lb">life (XII, {@211@}). Continuation of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on
<div n="lb">abstention from acts and the nature of knowledge. Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the faults that should
<div n="lb">be got rid of in order to attain to emancipation (XII, {@212@}).
<div n="lb">Continuation of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse (XII, {@213@}). {%Bhīṣma's%}
<div n="lb">discourse on the means of conquering the senses (XII, {@214@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on the consequences of attachment to
<div n="lb">the objects of the senses (XII, {@215@}). {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse
<div n="lb">on the nature and causes of dreams. Darkness has been
<div n="lb">adopted by the {%Asuras, Bráhman%} is difficult of attainment
<div n="lb">by either the gods or the {%Asuras;%} goodness, passion, and
<div n="lb">darkness belong to the deities and the {%Asuras;%} goodness is
<div n="lb">the attribute of the deities, while the two others belong
<div n="lb">to the {%Asuras; Bráhman%} transcends all those attributes;
<div n="lb">it is pure knowledge, and is obtainable only by withdrawing
<div n="lb">the mind and the senses from all external objects (XII, {@216@}).
<div n="lb">Who may be said to know {%Bráhman;%} the distinction between
<div n="lb">{%pravṛtti%} and {%nivṛtti;%} the respective nature of {%prakṛti%} and
<div n="lb">{%puruṣa;%} the nature and consequences of {%yoga%} (XII, {@217@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 668: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the conduct by which
[Page483-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Janaka%} the king of Mithilā attained to emancipation.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} recited the old narrative of the conversation
<div n="lb">between {%Pañcaśikha%} and {%Janaka%} of Mithilā, i.e. {%Pañcaśikha-%}
<div n="lb">{%vākya (b)%} (XII, {@218—219@}).—§ 669: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">what leads to happiness and what to misery and what to
<div n="lb">freedom from fear; {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on self-restraint
<div n="lb">(XII, {@220@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} question about the merits of
<div n="lb">subsisting upon the remnants of sacrifices, and whether
<div n="lb">fasting be really a penance {%(tapas); Bhīṣma%} explained that
<div n="lb">though fasting is generally regarded as a penance, it is not so
<div n="lb">in reality, being rather an impediment to the acquisition
<div n="lb">of the knowledge of soul; living upon sacrificial remnants is
<div n="lb">regarded as fasting of the highest merit (XII, {@221@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 670: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked whether man should be regarded
<div n="lb">as the real doer of acts. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative
<div n="lb">of a discourse between the {%Daitya%} king {%Prahlāda,%} who
<div n="lb">was unattached to worldly objects, etc., and {%Indra,%} who
<div n="lb">questioned {%Prahlāda%} about the best means by which
<div n="lb">knowledge of the soul can be attained, etc., and was
<div n="lb">instructed by him. {%Indra%} became filled with wonder, and,
<div n="lb">having worshipped the {%Daitya%} king, proceeded to his own
<div n="lb">abode (XII, {@222@}).—§ 671: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about
<div n="lb">the kind of intelligence by adopting which a king deprived
<div n="lb">of kingdom and prosperity may still live on earth. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">related the old narrative of the discourse between {%Indra%}

<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked as to what is good for a man sunk
<div n="lb">into dire distress. {%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on fortitude, quoting
<div n="lb">the old narrative of the discourse between {%Bali%} and {%Vāsava%}
<div n="lb">(Indra), i.e. Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda {%(b)%} (XII, {@227@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 674: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the indications of future
<div n="lb">greatness and future fall. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old story of

<div n="lb">end” (XII, {@230@}).—§ 676: Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">about the man that is dear to all, {%Bhīṣma%} quoted the words
<div n="lb">that {%Kṛṣṇa,%} asked by {%Ugrasena,%} said to him on a former
<div n="lb">occasion on the subject of D.-ṛ. {%Nārada's%} qualifications
<div n="lb">(XII, {@231@}).—§ 677: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the origin

<div n="lb">the {%Vedas%} with all their branches, and the {%Upaniṣads,%} and
<div n="lb">was desirous of leading the life of {%brahmacarya%}) about these
<div n="lb">very questions. {%Vyāsa%} said: Only {%Bráhman%} is without

<div n="lb">15 winks of the eye = 1 {%kāṣṭhā;%} 30 {%kāṣṭhās%} = 1 {%kalā;%}
<div n="lb">30(1/10) {%kalās%} = 1 {%muhūrta;%} 30 {%muhūrtas%} = 1 day and night;

<div n="lb">the duration is 4,000 [celestial] years, with a morning

<div n="lb">“The fourth stage [of life] is based upon the {%Upaniṣads;%} the

<div n="lb">{%(b)%} with Mṛtyu-Prajāpati-saṃvāda {%(c)%} (XII, {@257-@}
<div n="lb">{@259@}).—§ 679: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what is righteousness
<div n="lb">and whether righteousness is for this world or for the next
[Page485-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">or for both. {%Bhīṣma's%} answer: the practices of the good,

<div n="lb">(XII, {@260@}). Continuation (XII, {@261@}).—§ 680: Inquired

<div n="lb">Jājali-saṃvāda {%(b)%} (XII, {@263—265@}).—§ 681: {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">related an old narrative of what was recited by king
<div n="lb">{%Vicakhyu%} (B. {%°khn°%}) through compassion for all creatures,
<div n="lb">in condemnation of animal slaughter when he saw the
<div n="lb">mangled body of a bull and heard the painful groans

<div n="lb">brahmans gathered there to assist at the ceremonies. “{%Manu%}
<div n="lb">has applauded harmlessness in all acts…The true
<div n="lb">brahmans realize the presence of {%Viṣṇu%} in every sacrifice.”
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} said that one should
<div n="lb">acquire merit and act in such a way that one's body may
<div n="lb">not languish and suffer pain, and that death may not come
<div n="lb">(XII, {@266@}).—§ 682: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked whether one
<div n="lb">should act speedily or with delay. {%Bhīṣma%} told the old
<div n="lb">story of what occurred with respect to the wise {%Cirakārin,%}
<div n="lb">the son of {%Medhātithi Gautama%} of the race of {%Aṅgiras%}
<div n="lb">{%(Āṅgirase kule),%} who came to be called thus because he
<div n="lb">used to reflect long upon all matters, etc., and was regarded
<div n="lb">as an idle and foolish person. Once M.-ṛ. {%Gautama%} (the
<div n="lb">foremost of practisers of {%yoga%}), witnessing an act of grave
<div n="lb">misconduct in his wife {%Ahalyā,%} in wrath commanded {%Cirakārin%}
<div n="lb">to slay her, and then departed for the woods. {%Cirakārin%}
<div n="lb">began to think for a long while (description), remembering
<div n="lb">that the father is the performer of {%garbhādhāna%} and
<div n="lb">{%sīmantonnayana,%} etc., and that the mother is the son's
<div n="lb">{%dhātrī,%} etc. (etymology of several names of the mother
<div n="lb">and of the father), etc.; he thought that his mother was
<div n="lb">not to blame, as {%Indra%} had come to her in the form of her
<div n="lb">husband, etc. When many days had expired {%Gautama%}
<div n="lb">returned, shedding tears of repentance and thinking that
<div n="lb">the fault committed was due to his own carelessness
<div n="lb">(etymology of two names of the wife), and now became
<div n="lb">filled with great joy, and from that time, dwelling in his
<div n="lb">hermitage, did not live separately from his spouse or his
<div n="lb">son. He said: “Blessed be thou, O {%Cirakārika!%} do thou
<div n="lb">always reflect long before acting,” uttering some verses
<div n="lb">upon the merits of reflecting long. {%Gautama%} at last ascended
<div n="lb">to heaven with his son (XII, {@267@}).—§ 683: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">asked how a king should protect his subjects without
<div n="lb">injuring anybody. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the
<div n="lb">conversation between {%Dyumatsena%} and his son king {%Satyavat,%}
<div n="lb">and the words spoken by the latter in behalf of some
<div n="lb">individuals who had been brought out for execution at the
<div n="lb">command of his father (“the killing of individuals can
<div n="lb">never be a righteous act”), quoting the instructions he
<div n="lb">had received from their grandsires of olden days, as to how
<div n="lb">kings should rule their subjects in the different ages (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">“when the {%Kali%} age sets in…fifteen parts of even that
<div n="lb">one-fourth of righteousness disappear, one-sixteenth thereof
<div n="lb">being all that then remains of it,” and quoting {%Manu%}
<div n="lb">{%Svāyambhuva%} (XII, {@268@}).—§ 684: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
<div n="lb">about the relative superiority of domestic life and {%yoga.%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} recited the old narrative of the discourse between
<div n="lb">the {%Yati Kapila%} and {%Syūmaraśmi%} on animal sacrifices, the
<div n="lb">obligatory character of acts, and the merits of {%yoga%} and
<div n="lb">renunciation. In days of old when {%Tcaṣtṛ%} came to king
<div n="lb">{%Nahuṣa,%} the latter was on the point of killing a cow in order
[Page485-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">to show him hospitality; {%Kapila%} said, “Alas! ye {%Vedas%}”;
<div n="lb">Ṛ. {%Syūmaraśmi,%} entering the cow, blamed this saying of
<div n="lb">{%Kapila,%} etc. (XII, {@269@}); the three classes of {%Pitṛs%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">etc. (XII, {@270@}). Continuation (XII, {@271@}).—§ 685:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked which among the three, viz. religion,
<div n="lb">profit, and pleasure, is superior. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the ancient
<div n="lb">narrative of the benefit that the cloud {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} (not
<div n="lb">yet adored by other men) in days of old had conferred
<div n="lb">upon a poor brahman that was devoted to him, and who
<div n="lb">had failed to obtain wealth by worshipping the gods.
<div n="lb">The brahman worshipped the cloud with {%dhūpas,%} etc.; the
<div n="lb">cloud became pleased and said to the brahman that the
<div n="lb">wise have ordained expiation for brahmanicide, drinking
<div n="lb">spirits, stealing, etc., but not for one that is ungrateful;
<div n="lb">“Expectation has a child named Iniquity, Wrath is a child
<div n="lb">of Envy, Cupidity of Deceit, Ingratitude is barren.” After
<div n="lb">that the brahman, on a bed of {%kuśa%}-grass and penetrated
<div n="lb">with the energy of {%Kuṇḍadhāra,%} beheld all living beings
<div n="lb">in a dream, and {%Maṇibhadra%} in the midst of the gods
<div n="lb">employed in giving his orders; the gods were engaged in
<div n="lb">bestowing kingdoms, etc., upon men, etc.; {%Kuṇḍadhāra%}
<div n="lb">prostrated himself before the gods in the presence of all
<div n="lb">Y. and prayed for some favour in behalf of the brahman;
<div n="lb">{%Maṇibhadra%} first offered to give him wealth, but was
<div n="lb">prevailed upon by {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} to give virtue alone. The
<div n="lb">brahman became disgusted with the world and entered the
<div n="lb">woods and practised severe penances (description), and his
<div n="lb">mind was firmly set upon virtue; his strength did not
<div n="lb">diminish, and after a long time he acquired spiritual
<div n="lb">vision, etc. {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} then paid him a visit and caused
<div n="lb">him to see the end that is attained by kings; he beheld
<div n="lb">thousands of kings sunk in hell, and many living in this
<div n="lb">world embracing lust and wrath, etc. {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} said:
<div n="lb">“With these [vices] all human beings are enchained; the
<div n="lb">gods are afraid of men; these vices, at the command of
<div n="lb">the gods, mar and disconcert on every side; no man can
<div n="lb">become virtuous unless permitted by the gods…” The
<div n="lb">brahman confessed that he had not appreciated {%Kuṇḍadhāra's%}
<div n="lb">favour as he ought to do; {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} forgave him and
<div n="lb">disappeared. The brahman roamed through all the worlds,
<div n="lb">having attained to ascetic success {%(siddhiṃ)%} through the
<div n="lb">grace of {%Kuṇḍadhāra.%} D., {%brahmans,%} Y., good men, and Cā.
<div n="lb">always adore only the virtuous (XII, {@272@}).—§ 686:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what that sacrifice is which is ordained
<div n="lb">for the sake of virtue alone and not for the acquisition of
<div n="lb">heaven or wealth. {%Bhīṣma%} related the history, formerly
<div n="lb">recited by {%Nārada,%} of a brahman named {%Satya,%} who in
<div n="lb">order to perform sacrifices lived according to the {%uñcha%}
<div n="lb">vow (description); his wife {%Puṣkaradhāriṇī%} did not approve
<div n="lb">of his conduct (i.e. his cruel sacrifices), but at his com-
<div n="lb">mand she (clad in plumes of peacocks) joined a sacrifice
<div n="lb">where he was the {%hotṛ.%} His neighbour the virtuous
<div n="lb">{%Parṇāda%} at the command of {%Śukra%} (or, according to a
<div n="lb">various reading, of {%Śukra's%} race, so B., the text of C. is
<div n="lb">in disorder) addressed him in the shape of a deer, telling
<div n="lb">him to slay him and sacrifice with him, and {%Sāvitrī%} also
<div n="lb">told him to do so, but in vain; {%Sāvitrī%} then entered the
<div n="lb">sacrificial fire; but the deer (who was {%Dharma%}), causing
<div n="lb">the brahman through spiritual vision to behold Aps. and G.,
<div n="lb">at first made him desire to slay the deer (at which his
<div n="lb">{%tapas%} diminished greatly), but then won him over to the
<div n="lb">{%ahiṃsā%} religion, and himself assisted him in his sacrifice;
<div n="lb">“the injury of living creatures forms no part of sacrifice
[Page486-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">(leading only to heaven)” (XII, {@273@}).—§ 687: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">inquired about how one becomes sinful, or virtuous, by what
<div n="lb">one attains to renunciation, and by what one wins emancipation,
<div n="lb">whereafter he was instructed by {%Bhīṣma%} (XII, {@274@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} expounded the means for
<div n="lb">attaining to emancipation (XII, {@275@}).—§ 688: Continuation
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse, quoting the old narrative of the
<div n="lb">discourse between {%Nārada%} and {%Asita Devala,%} whom {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">questioned about the origin and destruction of all creatures
<div n="lb">(XII, {@276@}).—§ 689: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired after the means
<div n="lb">for removing desire. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of
<div n="lb">what was said by the {%Videha%} king to the inquiring {%Māṇḍavya:%}
<div n="lb">“Even if the whole of {%Mithilā%} burn in a conflagration,
<div n="lb">nothing of mine will be burnt down.” The brahman {%Māṇḍavya%}
<div n="lb">became filled with joy and betook himself to the path of
<div n="lb">emancipation (XII, {@277@}).—§ 690: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
<div n="lb">about the good which one should pursue in view of
<div n="lb">the transient character of time. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old
<div n="lb">narrative of a discourse between a father, who was devoted
<div n="lb">only to the study of the {%Vedas,%} and his son {%Medhāvin,%}
<div n="lb">who was conversant with the religion of emancipation.
<div n="lb">The father acted in the way pointed out [by his son]
<div n="lb">(XII, {@278@}).—§ 691: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">explained of what behaviour a man should be, of what
<div n="lb">acts, of what kind of knowledge, etc., in order to be able
<div n="lb">to attain to {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@279@}).—§ 692: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">asked when he should succeed in abandoning sovereignty
<div n="lb">for adopting renunciation. {%Bhīṣma's%} answer stating the
<div n="lb">certainty of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} acquisition of emancipation, and
<div n="lb">quoting that discourse which was sung in days of old, viz. the
<div n="lb">conversation between Dai. (As.) {%Vṛtra,%} after he became
<div n="lb">divested of all his prosperity, and [his preceptor] {%Uśanas;%}
<div n="lb">{%Vṛtra%} said: “Desirous of fighting {%Indra,%} I beheld in that
<div n="lb">battle {%Hari = Nārāyaṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)” (XII, {@280@}); while
<div n="lb">{%Uśanas%} instructed him about {%Viṣṇu%} whose head is
<div n="lb">the infinite place [i.e. emancipation], {%Sanatkumāra%} came
<div n="lb">there and, asked by {%Uśanas,%} instructed {%Vṛtra; “Viṣṇu%} is
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} etc.” (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the six colours; the four higher
<div n="lb">regions (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the indestructible and infinite some say is the
<div n="lb">region of {%Mahādeva,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vṛtra%} became free from sorrow,
<div n="lb">gave up his life-breaths, and attained to the highest station.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked whether {%Kṛṣṇa%} is identical with the
<div n="lb">Supreme Deity; {%Bhīṣma%} answered in the affirmative.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} applause of {%Vṛtra. Bhīṣma%} said that the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} would in the end be numbered among the {%Siddhas%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@281@}).—§ 693: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how {%Vṛtra,%} whose
<div n="lb">virtue and devotion to {%Viṣṇu%} and comprehension of the
<div n="lb">{%Upaniṣads%} and the {%Vedānta%} were so great, was vanquished
<div n="lb">by {%Indra,%} and how the battle took place. {%Bhīṣma%} described

<div n="lb">how a king should behave in view of the great object of

<div n="lb">that was uttered by {%Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi%} to {%Sagara,%} who
<div n="lb">asked his counsel. {%Sagara%} acquired those virtues which
<div n="lb">are productive of emancipation and continued, with their

<div n="lb">asked why D.-ṛ. {%Uśanas Kāvya (Bhārgavadāyāda)%} sided with
<div n="lb">the {%Asuras%} and not with the gods, and whence he came

<div n="lb">“{%Rantideva%} obtained success in all the worlds by worshipping

<div n="lb">at that time the gods repaired to {%Śiva%} and imparted to

<div n="lb">their very habitations, and also the chief of those {%Asuras%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Mahāmoha,%} PCR.); the men again obtained their

<div n="lb">Then the seven Ṛ. came forward and installed {%Indra%} as the

<div n="lb">“{%Brahmán%} by penances created all existent objects;

<div n="lb">expounded the reason of the difference of colour in men;
<div n="lb">“originally sprung from {%Brahmán,%} all the inhabitants of

[Page487-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Parāśara%} said that it was by cleansing their souls by penances,

<div n="lb">opinion should be entertained about the virtues of truth,
<div n="lb">self-restraint, forgiveness, and wisdom. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the
<div n="lb">old narrative of the discourse between the {%Sādhyas%} and
<div n="lb">a Swan {%(haṃsa),%} who was {%Brahmán%} wandering through
<div n="lb">the three worlds, and having come upon the {%Sādhyas%}
<div n="lb">instructing them about the religion of emancipation;
<div n="lb">at last the {%Sādhyas%} put a series of detached questions,
<div n="lb">which were answered by the Swan (XII, {@300@}).—§ 704:

<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the principles of the {%Sāṅkhya%}
<div n="lb">[philosophy]; these principles have been established by all
<div n="lb">the puissant {%Yatis, Kapila,%} etc.; with the objects are engaged
<div n="lb">men, Pś., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “{%Viṣṇu%} is attached to [the organs of]

<div n="lb">inquired about what does deteriorate and what does
<div n="lb">not. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the discourse
<div n="lb">between Ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha%} and king {%Karāla-Janaka,%} who
<div n="lb">asked for his instruction. “At the end of {%Brahmán's%}

<div n="lb">The nine kinds of creation (XII, {@311@}). {%Yājñavalkya's%}

<div n="lb">on the destruction of the universe: “{%Brahmán,%} who is

<div n="lb">The story of {%Yājñavalkya's%} acquisition of the {%Yajurveda,%}
[Page488-a+ 63]

<div n="lb">I taught the {%Śatapathabrāhmaṇa,%} etc., to 100 good disciples
<div n="lb">and thereby did what was disagreeable to my maternal uncle

<div n="lb">maternal uncle as to who should be permitted to appropriate
<div n="lb">the {%dakṣiṇā%} for the recitation of the {%Vedas;%} in the very presence
<div n="lb">of {%Devala%} I took half of that {%dakṣiṇā;%} thy father and
