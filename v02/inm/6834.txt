[{@Mahāprasthānikaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to
<div n="lb">the great journey to the other world,” the 17th of the great
<div n="lb">and the 99th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Mahā-
<div n="lb">prasthānika(ṃ) parva(n)).—§ 794: {%Janamejaya%} said: Having
<div n="lb">heard of the battle with iron clubs between the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and
<div n="lb">{%Andhakas,%} and of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} ascension to heaven, what did
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} do? {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Having heard the
<div n="lb">particulars of the great slaughter of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">set his heart on leaving the world, saying to his brothers that
<div n="lb">it is Time that ripens every creature, of which they approved.
<div n="lb">He made the kingdom over to {%Yuyutsu%} and installed {%Parikṣit%}
<div n="lb">as king in {%Rāstinapura,%} while {%Vajra%} ruled in {%Indraprastha.%}
<div n="lb">Then he offered oblations of water to {%Kṛṣṇa, Rāma,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vasudeva,%} etc., and {%śrāddhas%} to his deceased kinsmen, and
<div n="lb">fed {%Vyāsa, Nārada, Mārkaṇḍeya,%} and {%Yājñavalkya,%} and gave
<div n="lb">jewels, etc. (specification) to brahmans in honour of {%Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa%} was installed as the preceptor of {%Parikṣit.%} Then he
<div n="lb">summoned his subjects and informed them of his intentions;
<div n="lb">they tried in vain to dissuade him. He and his brothers and
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} removed their ornaments and wore barks of trees;
<div n="lb">then they threw their sacred fires into the water. Then
<div n="lb">they set out on their journey: the five {%Pāṇḍavas, Draupadī,%}
<div n="lb">and a dog. {%Kṛpa,%} etc., stood around {%Yuyutsu; Ulūpī%} entered
<div n="lb">the waters of {%Gaṅgā; Citrāṅgada%} set out for {%Maṇipūra;%} the
<div n="lb">grandmothers of {%Parikṣit%} surrounded him. {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">etc., set out with their faces turned towards the east,
<div n="lb">devoting themselves to {%yoga,%} resolved to observe the religion
<div n="lb">of renunciation; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} first, then the other {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">in the order of their birth, behind them all {%Draupadī;%} a dog
<div n="lb">followed them. They reached the sea of red water. {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">came, and mentioning the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), he caused
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} to throw the {%Gāṇḍīva%} and his inexhaustible quivers
<div n="lb">into the water to be given back to {%Varuṇa.%} Then {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">disappeared. They now proceeded towards the south; then,
<div n="lb">by the northern coast of the salt sea, to the south-west;
<div n="lb">then towards the west, where they saw {%Dvārakā%} covered by
<div n="lb">the ocean; then to the north, observant of {%yoga,%} desirous
<div n="lb">of making a round of the whole earth (XVII, {@1@}). They
<div n="lb">crossed {%Himavat,%} and beheld a vast desert of sand, and
<div n="lb">then {%Meru. Kṛṣṇā%} dropped down; asked by {%Bhīmasena,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that this was the consequence of her
<div n="lb">partiality for {%Arjuna.%} Then {%Sahadeva%} fell down; asked by
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira%} said it was because he never thought
<div n="lb">anybody his equal in wisdom. They went on. {%Nakula%} fell;
<div n="lb">asked by {%Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira%} said it was because he
<div n="lb">thought that nobody equalled him in beauty, though his
<div n="lb">righteousness was without blemish. {%Arjuna%} fell down;
<div n="lb">asked by {%Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that it was because
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} had said that he would consume all the foes in
<div n="lb">a single day, but did not accomplish it. {%Bhīmasena%} fell
<div n="lb">down; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told him it was because he was a great
<div n="lb">eater, and used to boast of his strength. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">went on with the dog (XVII, {@2@}). {%Indra%} came with
<div n="lb">a chariot, and asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to ascend it for going to
<div n="lb">Heaven; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wanted to take {%Draupadī%} and his fallen
<div n="lb">brothers with him; {%Indra%} said they have already reached
<div n="lb">Heaven, where he will see them; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would have the
[Page456-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">dog to accompany him; † as {%Indra%} said there is no place in
<div n="lb">Heaven for persons with dogs, as the {%Krodhavaśas%} take away
<div n="lb">all the merits of such persons, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} refused to ascend
<div n="lb">the chariot. Then [the dog, transformed into] {%Dharma,%} said
<div n="lb">to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (†vv. 80—9) that he had formerly tested him
<div n="lb">in the {%Dvaitavana,%} where he had chosen the revival of {%Nakula,%}
<div n="lb">disregarding {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Arjuna,%} for doing good to his
<div n="lb">[step] mother; “there is no one in Heaven that is equal
<div n="lb">to thee.” Then {%Dharma, Indra,%} M., A., D., D.-ṛ., causing
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to ascend the chariot, proceeded to Heaven on
<div n="lb">their respective chariots. {%Nārada%} said that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">was superior to all the R.-ṛ. there. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished
<div n="lb">to proceed to where his brothers were; {%Indra,%} saying that
<div n="lb">his brothers had won regions of felicity, tried to persuade
<div n="lb">him to stay, beholding D.-ṛ. and Si.; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished
<div n="lb">to be united with his brothers and {%Draupadī%} (XVII, {@3@}).
