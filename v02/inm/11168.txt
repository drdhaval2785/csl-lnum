{@Upamanyu<sup>2</sup>, Vaiyāghrapadya@}¦ ({%°pāda%} C.), a ṛṣi.
<div n="lb">§ 730 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@14,@} 634 ({%Vaiyāghrapādasya%}
<div n="lb">({%°padya°,%} B.)), 655 (Kṛṣṇa came to the hermitage of {%U.,%}
<div n="lb">who advised him to gratify Śiva, whose granting of boons he
<div n="lb">described).—§ 730{%g%} (do.): {%Upamanyu%} said: In the {%Kṛtayuga%}
<div n="lb">there was a ṛṣi named {%Vyāghrapāda.%} I was born as his son
<div n="lb">and {%Dhaumya%} as my younger brother. Accompanied by
<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya,%} I once came to the hermitage of certain ṛṣis.
<div n="lb">There I saw milk, which appeared to me to be like to
<div n="lb">{%amṛta.%} Coming home, I asked my mother to give me some
<div n="lb">food prepared with milk. Having no milk my mother was
<div n="lb">sorry. She then took a cake (of rice) and boiled it into
<div n="lb">water and placed it before me, saying that it was milk.
<div n="lb">Knowing the nature of milk, I understood that this was not
<div n="lb">milk; this I said to my mother, who then answered me
<div n="lb">that ascetics in the wood could not have milk. “Whence
<div n="lb">shall we, who live at the river, the resort of the {%Vālakhilyas,%}
<div n="lb">obtain milk? In the wilderness are no offspring of {%Surabhī.%}”
<div n="lb">Then she told me to devote myself to {%Śaṅkara%} (i.e. Śiva).
<div n="lb">Questioned by me about Śiva my mother then, in accordance
<div n="lb">with the discourses of the {%munis,%} described the diverse
<div n="lb">forms of {%Mahādeva%} (i.e. Śiva) (<lang n="greek"></lang>). I then applied myself to
<div n="lb">the practice of penances in order to gratify {%Śiva.%} After
<div n="lb">a thousand celestial years {%Mahādeva%} appeared to me in
<div n="lb">the form of {%Śakra%} (i.e. Indra) riding on his elephant, but
<div n="lb">I did not desire a boon from any other deity than {%Mahādeva.%}
<div n="lb">Questioned by Indra about the reason, I stated {%Śiva%} to be
<div n="lb">the existent and the non-existent, the manifest and the
<div n="lb">unmanifest, the eternal and immutable, etc., and that there
<div n="lb">was nothing superior to {%Śiva%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Mahādeva%} resides in the
<div n="lb">worlds named {%Bhū,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). In all the encounters of the
<div n="lb">gods, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Bhava%} restores power to those who meet with
<div n="lb">destruction. It is {%Maheśvara%} who made futile the boons
<div n="lb">given to {%Andhaka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). He is adored by {%yogins,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), always say that there is none higher than
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva.%} His sign {%(liṅga)%} is worshipped by {%Brahmán,%} etc.
<div n="lb">The creatures bear only the signs of {%Mahādeva%} and his spouse,
<div n="lb">and those of {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “I shall never acknow-
<div n="lb">ledge any other deity. Nor would I take the fulfilment of
<div n="lb">all my wishes from any other deity.” When I had finished
<div n="lb">this-speech, the celestial elephant became transformed into a
<div n="lb">white bull (description), on the back of which {%Mahādeva,%}
<div n="lb">with {%Umā,%} was seated (description of Śiva and his weapons:
<div n="lb">{%Pināka%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>)). The {%Pāśupata%} weapon is superior to all other
<div n="lb">weapons such as the {%Brāhma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), but the {%śūla%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) is even
<div n="lb">superior. {%Śiva%} was also armed with the battle-axe, which he
<div n="lb">had given to {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). He was surrounded by
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The deities praised Śiva by uttering
<div n="lb">diverse hymns (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “I then praised him with a hymn (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
[Page692-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and offered him {%arghya%} (water). {%Śiva%} became gratified and
<div n="lb">granted me the fulfilment of all my wishes. I once more
<div n="lb">praised him (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and asked that I and my kinsmen and friends
<div n="lb">might always eat food with milk. {%Śiva%} granted this, and
<div n="lb">that after the expiration of a {%kalpa%} I should obtain the
<div n="lb">companionship of {%Śiva.%} Then the god disappeared”: XIII,
