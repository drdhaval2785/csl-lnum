<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas after the death of Pāṇḍu were brought to
<div n="lb">Hāstinapura and educated by Droṇa, under the supervision

<div n="lb">them, especially Duryodhana, who tried to murder Bhīmasena
<div n="lb">and later on all the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī (Mādrī had burnt
<div n="lb">herself with the corpse of Pāṇḍu), and Karṇa hated Arjuna
<div n="lb">from jealousy.—§ 203{%b%} (cf. Droṇa): I, {@132:@} One day
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} asked his pupils to promise to accomplish what
<div n="lb">he had on his heart; only {%Arjuna%} promised it. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">became the foremost of all his fellow-pupils. {%Droṇa%} gave
<div n="lb">every one of his pupils a narrow-mouthed vessel {%(kamaṇḍalu)%}
<div n="lb">for fetching water, in order that much time might be spent
<div n="lb">in filling it, but to {%Aśvatthāman%} he gave a broad-mouthed
<div n="lb">vessel {%(kumbha),%} and in the intervals so gained he used to

<div n="lb">filled the vessel by means of the {%Vāruṇa%} weapon, and used
[Page069-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">to come at the same time as {%Aśvatthāman. Droṇa%} told the
<div n="lb">cook never to give {%Arjuna%} his food in the dark, but not to
<div n="lb">tell him that it was he {%(Droṇa)%} that had ordered this. One
<div n="lb">day a wind put the lamp out when {%Arjuna%} was taking his
<div n="lb">food; but his hand went up to his mouth from habit. His
<div n="lb">attention being thus called to the force of habit, {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">practised with his bow in the night, and {%Droṇa%} promised him
<div n="lb">that there should not be a bowman equal to him in the world.
<div n="lb">He taught him also to fight on horseback, etc., with the

<div n="lb">{@132<lang n="greek"></lang>,@} 5293, 5296. One day Droṇa caused an artificial bird
<div n="lb">to be placed on the top of a tree, and first repeatedly asked
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira to tell what he did see, while aiming at the
<div n="lb">bird. He answered that he saw the tree, Droṇa, his
<div n="lb">brothers, and the bird. Droṇa reproachfully told him to
<div n="lb">stand apart. Then Droṇa repeated the experiment with his
<div n="lb">other pupils, with the same result (ch. {@132@}). At last
<div n="lb">Arjuna's turn came; he said first that he saw only the
<div n="lb">vulture, and then that he saw only its head, and, when
<div n="lb">Droṇa gave the order, he struck off its head with his shaft
<div n="lb">(I, {@133@}).—§ 207 (do.): I, {@133:@} Arjuna rescued the life
<div n="lb">of Droṇa by shooting with five arrows an alligator in the
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā that had seized his thigh. Droṇa gave him the
<div n="lb">weapon Brahmaśiras on the condition that he should not use
<div n="lb">it against a human foe, as it might burn the whole universe.
<div n="lb">—§ 208{%b%} (cf. Astradarśana): I, {@135:@} Then {%Arjuna%} appeared,
<div n="lb">while {%Kuntī%} wept with joy, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} learned from

<div n="lb">fire, by the {%Vāruṇa%} water, by the {%Vāyavya%} air, by the {%Pārjanya%}

<div n="lb">{%“asṛjadgirīn”%}), and by the {%Antardhāna%} weapon it again
<div n="lb">disappeared, etc.; he at one time shot five shafts together
<div n="lb">into the mouth of a moving iron boar, and discharged
<div n="lb">twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow's horn hung up
<div n="lb">in a rope and swaying to and fro (v. 5370, instead of {%“bale”%}
<div n="lb">read with B. and V. {%“cale”%}).—§ 208 (Astradarśana): I, {@137,@}
<div n="lb">5440, 5442: At the show of arms Karṇa in vain challenged

<div n="lb">5499, 5500, 5501. Arjuna helped Droṇa to subjugate
<div n="lb">Drupada, which favour Droṇa had asked as his fee.—
<div n="lb">§ 210{%c%} (cf. Sambhavaparvan): I, {@139:@} {%Droṇa%} taught {%Arjuna%}

<div n="lb">Headed by Arjuna, the Pāṇḍavas in war slew Sauvīra, who
<div n="lb">had performed a three years' sacrifice at the inroad of the

<div n="lb">failed to subject, was subdued by Arjuna; as was also the
<div n="lb">Sauvīra Vitula (B. {%Vipula%}), who had always shown a dis-
<div n="lb">regard for the Kurus; and the Sauvīra Sumitra, called
<div n="lb">Dattāmitra (LIA. i, pp. 656/804, n. 2); assisted by Bhīma,
<div n="lb">Arjuna with only a single chariot subjugated all the kings of

<div n="lb">fought the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, {@47@}). {%A.%} fought the Saṃśap-

<div n="lb">the Nāga weapon, paralyzing the legs (encircled with snakes) of
<div n="lb">the Saṃśaptakas; Suśarman invoked the Sauparṇa weapon;
<div n="lb">birds came down and devoured the snakes; {%A.%} sat down,
<div n="lb">recovered, and invoked the Aindra weapon; the battle became
<div n="lb">awful (VIII, {@53@}). {%A.%} fought the Saṃśaptakas; he addressed
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa upon beholding Karṇa's {%(e)%} prowess, and as the
<div n="lb">Saṃśaptakas were defeated (when the sun had ascended the
<div n="lb">meridian), {%A.%} pierced through the Kuru host. Duryodhana
<div n="lb">once more urged the Saṃśaptakas against him. Having slain

<div n="lb">Saṃśaptakas, which was protected by the Kāmbojas; the

<div n="lb">was nowhere to be seen; “the third part of the day still
<div n="lb">remains.” {%A.%} proceeded to Yudhiṣṭhira; Kṛṣṇa described
<div n="lb">the field of battle to {%A.%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). A terrible battle ensued
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@58@}). A remnant only of the Saṃśaptakas were
<div n="lb">left unslaughtered. Dhṛṣṭadyumna was worsted by Aśvat-
<div n="lb">thāman and rescued by {%A.; A.%} proceeded towards the
<div n="lb">Saṃśaptakas (VIII, {@59@}). Kṛṣṇa pointed out to {%A.%} that

<div n="lb">and was in great danger; Karṇa would soon come against
<div n="lb">{%A.%} and was protected by Duryodhana; he should be slain.
<div n="lb">{%A.%} then destroyed the remnant of his foes; the Saṃśaptakas
<div n="lb">fled (VIII, {@60@}). {%A.%} fought against Aśvatthāman (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@61@}). {%A.%} appeared (VIII, {@62@}). Śalya exhorted Karṇa to
<div n="lb">fight with {%A.,%} but in vain; he once more reminded Karṇa
<div n="lb">of {%A.,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@63@}). {%A.%} fought with Aśvatthāman;
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman employed the Aindra weapon, which {%A.%}
<div n="lb">neutralized with a mighty weapon created by Indra; at

<div n="lb">about Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa asked him first to find Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@64@}). {%A.%} met with Bhīma and asked him to bring
<div n="lb">intelligence of Yudhiṣṭhira; but they agreed that {%A.%}
<div n="lb">should go to Yudhiṣṭhira while Bhīma should resist the
<div n="lb">Saṃśaptakas. {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa found Yudhiṣṭhira lying on
<div n="lb">his bed (VIII, {@65@}). {%A.%} swore to slay Karṇa and all the
[Page082-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">foes that day (VIII, {@67@}). Yudhiṣṭhira censured {%A.,%}
<div n="lb">thinking that he had run away from the battle leaving Bhīma
<div n="lb">unsupported (<lang n="greek"></lang>), several times invoking him to give up
<div n="lb">the Gāṇḍīva to somebody else (VIII, {@68@}). {%A.%} drew his sword
<div n="lb">in order to strike off Yudhiṣṭhira's head in fulfilment of his
<div n="lb">vow regarding the person who would tell him to give up the
<div n="lb">Gāṇḍīva (<lang n="greek"></lang>); Kṛṣṇa addressed {%A.%} on the nature of truth
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%A.%} said he must keep his vow (<lang n="greek"></lang>); Kṛṣṇa suggested
<div n="lb">that {%A.,%} by insulting Yudhiṣṭhira, by addressing him with
<div n="lb">“thou,” would be regarded as having slain him (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@69@}). Urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%} insulted Yudhiṣṭhira in a long
<div n="lb">speech (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then he became despondent and desired to
<div n="lb">cut off his own head; Kṛṣṇa urged him to utter his own
<div n="lb">praises, as self-praise was equal to self-destruction. {%A.%} praised
<div n="lb">himself (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and asked for Yudhiṣṭhira's forgiveness,
<div n="lb">promising to slay Karṇa and rescue Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa induced
<div n="lb">him to forgive both himself and {%A.%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@70@}).
<div n="lb">Speeches of Kṛṣṇa, {%A.,%} and Yudhiṣṭhira on the same topic
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@71@}). {%A.%} proceeded to slay Karṇa, having

<div n="lb">to raise his spirits (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@72@}); continuation (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@73@}). {%A.'s%} cheerful reply to Kṛṣṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@74@}). Sañjaya related; {%A.%} slew many (VIII, {@75@}). Bhīma
<div n="lb">said to his charioteer Viśoka that he was anxious about {%A.%}
<div n="lb">and Yudhiṣṭhira; Viśoka pointed out to Bhīma that {%A.%} was
<div n="lb">returning to battle (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@76@}). {%A.%} and Bhīma attacked
<div n="lb">the Kaurava army (description) (VIII, {@77@}). {%A.%} produced
<div n="lb">a river of blood (description). Requested by {%A.%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">brought him to Karṇa; Duryodhana attacked {%A.; A.%}
<div n="lb">vanquished Aśvatthāman, Kṛpa, and Kṛtavarman; Śikhaṇḍin,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), proceeding towards {%A.,%} checked the foes (VIII, {@79@}).
<div n="lb">{%A.,%} avoiding Karṇa, proceeded to the rescue of Bhīma; he
<div n="lb">informed Bhīma that Yudhiṣṭhira was well; he slew ten
<div n="lb">sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (VIII, {@80@}). {%A.%} was assailed by ninety
<div n="lb">Saṃśaptakas as he was proceeding towards Karna's chariot;
<div n="lb">he slew them; so also many Kauravas and a force of Mlecchas,
<div n="lb">mounted on 1,300 elephants under the command of Duryodhana.
<div n="lb">Bhīma rushed towards {%A.,%} and destroyed a small unslaughtered
<div n="lb">remnant of the Kauravas; then he followed {%A.%} in his rear
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@81@}). Kṛṣṇa urged {%A.%} to slay Karṇa; {%A.%} proceeded
<div n="lb">with Bhīmasena (VIII, {@82@}). Bhīmasena took up a little of
<div n="lb">Duḥśāsana's blood and drank it (<lang n="greek"></lang>), addressing Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">and {%A.,%} and vowing soon to slay Duryodhana (VIII, {@83@}).
<div n="lb">Urged by Bhīma and Nakula, {%A.%} proceeded towards Vṛṣasena
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@84@}). {%A.%} slew Karṇa's son Vṛṣasena, and threatened
<div n="lb">to slay Karṇa, as Bhīma would slay Duryodhana; {%A.%} attacked
<div n="lb">Karṇa (VIII, {@85@}); Kṛṣṇa addressed {%A.%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%A.'s%} reply
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@86@}); description of {%A.%} and Karṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>); As.,
<div n="lb">Yātudhānas, Gh., etc., sided with Karṇa; the Vedas,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), took the side of {%A.;%} the smaller snakes all
<div n="lb">sided with Karṇa; V., M., Sā., R., V.-D., A., and Agni,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), sided with {%A.,%} while all Ā. sided with Karṇa;
<div n="lb">the Vaiśyas, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), sided with Karṇa; P., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), with
<div n="lb">{%A.;%} the Pretas, Pś., Rā., etc., with Karṇa; D.-ṛ., B.-ṛ.,
<div n="lb">R.-ṛ., with {%A.,%} as also G. headed by Tumburu. With the
<div n="lb">Prādheyas and Mauneyas, G., and Aps., and many wise
<div n="lb">sages, having wolves for their vehicles, came to witness the
<div n="lb">encounter that was also witnessed by D., Dā., G., N., Y., etc.,
<div n="lb">M.-ṛ., P. (subsisting upon Svadhā), etc., and Brahmán with
<div n="lb">B.-ṛ., and Prajāpatis, and Bhava. Indra wished that {%A.%}
<div n="lb">should vanquish Karṇa; Sūrya, that Karṇa should vanquish
<div n="lb">{%A.;%} the gods urged Brahmán that the success of both should
<div n="lb">be equal, Indra that {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa should win; Brahmán
[Page082-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and Īśāna (i.e. Śiva) said that the victory of {%A.%} was certain
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>): “let Karṇa obtain identity with V. or M., let him
<div n="lb">be worshipped in heaven with Droṇa and Bhīṣma.” Indra
<div n="lb">acquiesced by their words. Description of Karṇa's and {%A.'s%}
<div n="lb">chariots; the ape on {%A.'s%} banner attacked the elephant's rope
<div n="lb">on Karṇa's banner. Kṛṣṇa and Śalya darted keen glances at
<div n="lb">each other, and so did {%A.%} and Karṇa. Śalya said that he would
<div n="lb">slay both Kṛṣṇa and {%A.%} if Karṇa was slain; Kṛṣṇa said that
<div n="lb">Karṇa could not slay {%A.;%} otherwise, the destruction of the
<div n="lb">universe would be at hand, and he would himself slay Karṇa
<div n="lb">and Śalya. {%A.%} said that that day the wives of Karṇa would
<div n="lb">become widows (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@87@}). In the welkin D., N.,
<div n="lb">As., Si., Y., G., Rā., Aps., and B.-ṛ., etc., looked on. The
<div n="lb">battle commenced. {%A.%} defeated Duryodhana, etc. (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@88@}); description of the battle between {%A.%} and Karṇa; {%A.%}
<div n="lb">employed an Āgneya weapon, which was neutralized by
<div n="lb">Karṇa with a Vāruṇa weapon by means of clouds, which
<div n="lb">was in its turn dispelled by {%A.%} by means of a Vāyavya
<div n="lb">weapon; {%A.%} employed the Aindra weapon {%(? dayitaṃ deva-%}
<div n="lb">{%rājñaḥ; Mahendrasyāstraṃ),%} Karṇa the Bhārgava weapon.
<div n="lb">Seeing {%A.'s%} weapons neutralized by Karṇa, Bhīma (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>) urged {%A.%} to put forth his strength. {%A.%} bowed
<div n="lb">to Brahmán and invoked the Brāhma weapon, which could be
<div n="lb">applied by the mind alone; Karṇa neutralized it; urged by
<div n="lb">Bhīma, {%A.%} applied a second Brāhma weapon, which caused
<div n="lb">a great carnage among the Kaurava troops (description).
<div n="lb">{%A.%} shot at Karṇa and Śalya and slew Sabhāpati, etc. The
<div n="lb">Kauravas urged Karṇa to slay {%A.%} Yudhiṣṭhira appeared in
<div n="lb">order to witness the encounter. {%A.'s%} bowstring burst; Karṇa
<div n="lb">pierced {%A.%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Karṇa employed five snakes as arrows;
<div n="lb">they were cut off by {%A.,%} who slew 2,000 Kurus. The Kurus
<div n="lb">fled, leaving Karṇa to fight alone with {%A.%} (VIII, {@89@}). The
<div n="lb">snake Aśvasena entered into Karṇa's quiver in the form of an
<div n="lb">arrow. Karṇa and {%A.%} were fanned and sprinkled with
<div n="lb">fragrant sandal-water by many Aps., staying in the welkin,
<div n="lb">and Śakra and Sūrya gently brushed their faces with their
<div n="lb">hands. Karṇa aimed that arrow which he had long kept for
<div n="lb">{%A.'s%} destruction. Omens appeared; Karṇa did not know that
<div n="lb">Aśvasena had entered his arrow. Kṛṣṇa with his feet
<div n="lb">pressed {%A.'s%} car about a cubit into the earth and the snake-
<div n="lb">arrow only broke his diadem (made by Svayambhū for
<div n="lb">Indra > {%A.%}); incapable of being crushed by Rudra, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">Karṇa would not shoot the same weapon again. Aśvasena then
<div n="lb">of his own accord came towards {%A.%} in the shape of an arrow;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa informed {%A.; A.%} cut off the snake, and Kṛṣṇa raised
<div n="lb">the chariot from the earth. Once, when Karṇa was stupefied,
<div n="lb">{%A.%} did not wish to slay him, but he was taught by Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">never to spare an enemy. Karṇa invoked the Brāhma weapon
<div n="lb">and {%A.%} the Aindra weapon, which was neutralized by Karṇa;
<div n="lb">urged by Kṛṣṇa to shoot “high weapons,” {%A.%} shot the Brāhma
<div n="lb">weapon. Karṇa cut off eleven bowstrings of {%A.'s%} one after
<div n="lb">another, not knowing that {%A.%} had 100 strings to his bow;
<div n="lb">urged by Kṛṣṇa to strike Karṇa with “superior weapons,”
<div n="lb">{%A.%} then consecrated another celestial weapon with mantras,
<div n="lb">uniting the Raudra weapon with it. At that time the earth
<div n="lb">swallowed up Karṇa's wheels. Karṇa asked {%A.%} to wait for
<div n="lb">a moment till he had raised his sunken wheel (VIII, {@90@}).
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa urged {%A.%} to pierce Karṇa with a celestial weapon;
<div n="lb">{%A.%} kindled with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to
<div n="lb">emanate from all the pores of his body. Both Karṇa and {%A.%}
<div n="lb">invoked the Brāhma weapon; {%A.%} shot an Agni weapon,
<div n="lb">which was neutralized by Karṇa with the Vāruṇa weapon,
<div n="lb">spreading darkness in all directions, which {%A.%} dispelled
[Page083-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">with the Vāyavya weapon. Pierced by a shaft of Karṇa's,
<div n="lb">{%A.%} began to reel, etc.; Karṇa in vain endeavoured to
<div n="lb">extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses, {%A.%} took up an
<div n="lb">Añjalika weapon. Urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%} cut off Karṇa's
<div n="lb">standard, and then struck off Karṇa's head with an Añjalika
<div n="lb">weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out “Peace be to the
<div n="lb">universe!”) (VIII, {@91@}). {%A.%} fought the chariots of the
<div n="lb">Kauravas. {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa blew their conchs; D., G., men,
<div n="lb">Cā., M.-ṛ., Y., and M.-U. congratulated {%A.%} (VIII, {@94@}). Urged
<div n="lb">by Kṛṣṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%A.%} presented himself to Yudhiṣṭhira, who
<div n="lb">greeted {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira, with Kṛṣṇa and {%A.,%}
