[{@Māndhātrupākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (episode relating to Mān-
<div n="lb">dhātṛ.) (cf. {%Māndhātuḥ…upākhyānaṃ,%} I, 446).—§ 407
<div n="lb">(Tīrthay.): Questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Lomaśa%} said: King
<div n="lb">({%rājarṣi,%} v. 10429) {%Yuvanāśva Saudyumni,%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race,
<div n="lb">performed besides other sacrifices 1,000 horse-sacrifices. As
<div n="lb">he had no sons, he made over the duties of the state to his
<div n="lb">ministers, and retired to the woods. Having once observed
<div n="lb">a fast, he entered the hermitage of {%Bhṛgu,%} while the great
<div n="lb">ṛṣis were asleep, and drank a jar of water, which the son of
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgu (maharṣiḥ),%} after having performed severe austerities,
<div n="lb">had destined to be drunk by {%Yuvanāśva's%} queen in order
<div n="lb">that she should bear him a son, who by his bravery might
<div n="lb">send even {%Indra%} to the abode of {%Yama.%} A sacrifice was then
<div n="lb">performed for him; after 100 years a son pierced {%Yuvanāśva's%}
<div n="lb">left side (nor did {%Yuvanāśva%} die). {%Indra%} came, and put the
<div n="lb">boy's forefinger into his mouth, saying “me he shall suck”
<div n="lb">({%mām ayaṃ dhāsyati,%} whence the boy was called {%Māndhātṛ%}).
<div n="lb">Thereby {%Māndhātṛ%} became very strong, and grew 13 cubits
<div n="lb">{%(kiṣkūn),%} and acquired the whole of the {%Vedas%} including the
<div n="lb">{%Dhanurveda%} by his thought alone, and on the same day he
<div n="lb">obtained the bow {%Ājagava%} and a number of shafts made of horn,
<div n="lb">and an impenetrable coat of mail. He was placed on the throne
<div n="lb">by {%Indra%} himself, and conquered the three worlds in a righteous
<div n="lb">way; the gems of their own accord came into his possession,
<div n="lb">and he performed a number of sacrifices with abundant
<div n="lb">gratuities, and sat at {%Indra's%} side. His sacrificial grounds
<div n="lb">{%(caityaiḥ)%} were to be found all over the earth, and he is said
<div n="lb">to have given away to the Brahmans 10,000 {%padmas%} of kine.
<div n="lb">After twelve years' drought he caused rain to come down,
<div n="lb">paying no heed to {%Indra.%} He slew the {%Gāndhāra%} king of the
<div n="lb">lunar dynasty. Here, in the midst of {%Kurukṣetra,%} is the
<div n="lb">spot where he sacrificed to the gods (III, {@126@}).
