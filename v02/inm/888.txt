{@Aṣṭāvakrīya(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to Aṣṭāvakra”).
<div n="lb">—§ 51 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2,@} 449: {%A. atraiva vivādo yatra%}
<div n="lb">{%Bandinā,%} etc.—§ 412 (Tīrthay.): III, {@132@} ff.: {%Uddālaka%}
<div n="lb">gave his own daughter {%Sujātā%} in marriage, together with
<div n="lb">sacred learning {%(śrutaṃ),%} to his disciple the brahman {%Kahoda,%}
<div n="lb">who had served him long. The embryo in her womb had
<div n="lb">become versed in the {%Śāstras%} and the {%Vedas%} with the {%aṅgas,%}
<div n="lb">and blamed {%Kahoda,%} who had been reading the whole night.
<div n="lb">The great {%ṛṣi Kahoda%} cursed him to become crooked on
<div n="lb">eight parts of his body, wherefore he, when born, was
<div n="lb">called {%Aṣṭāvakra.%} In order to procure wealth for {%Sujātā,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kahoda%} went to king {%Janaka%} (son of {%Indradyumna,%} v. {@133,@}
<div n="lb">10624), where he was defeated in a controversy with the
<div n="lb">{%sūta%} (v. 10613, etc., {%sūtaputram%} v. 10671) {%Bandin%} and was
<div n="lb">immersed into water. {%Uddālaka%} prevailed upon {%Sujātā%} to
<div n="lb">keep it a secret from {%Aṣṭāvakra,%} who regarded {%Uddālaka%}
<div n="lb">as his father and {%Śvetaketu,%} the son of {%Uddālaka,%} who was
<div n="lb">of the same age with himself, as his brother, until in his
<div n="lb">12th year {%Śvetaketu%} in anger happened to disclose the
<div n="lb">matter to him. He and {%Śvetaketu%} then went to the sacrifice
<div n="lb">of {%Janaka,%} and on being driven from the entrance {%Aṣṭāvakra%}
<div n="lb">met the king (III, {@132@}), and in the course of a conversation
<div n="lb">with him and the doorkeeper he compared {%Janaka%} to {%Yayāti,%}
<div n="lb">and said that he had heard that {%Bandin%} caused those whom
<div n="lb">he had vanquished in disputation to be drowned in the sea
<div n="lb">by men sent by {%Janaka,%} and he declared that he had come to
<div n="lb">maintain the unity with {%Bráhman (Brahmādvaitam)%} and to
<div n="lb">defeat {%Bandin;%} then he answered several enigmatical questions
<div n="lb">(about the wheel of Time, the thunder and lightning, the
<div n="lb">fish, egg, stone, and river) and was admitted (III, {@133@}).
<div n="lb">Here they disputed in such a way that {%Bandin%} enumerated
<div n="lb">things of which there is only 1 (fire, Sun, {%Indra,%} and {%Yama%}),
<div n="lb">{%Aṣṭāvakra%} groups of 2 ({%Indra%} and {%Agni,%} 2 devarṣis:
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} and {%Parvata,%} 2 {%Aśvins,%} 2 wheels of a chariot;
<div n="lb">husband and wife), {%Ba°%} of 3 (3 times the creatures are born,
<div n="lb">etc.; see Nīl.), {%A°%} of 4 (4 are the {%āśramas%} of the {%brahmans;%}
<div n="lb">4 orders perform this sacrifice(!), etc.), {%Ba°%} of 5 (5 fires, etc.),
<div n="lb">{%A°%} of 6 (6 cows, it is asserted by some, are the {%dakṣiṇā%}
<div n="lb">for establishing the sacred fire, {%“ādhāne,”%} etc.), {%Ba°%} of 7
<div n="lb">(7 domesticated animals, 7 wild animals, etc.), {%A°%} of 8 (8 {%śāṇas%}
<div n="lb">make a {%śatamāna,%} see BR., 8 are the legs of the {%śarabha,%}
<div n="lb">etc.), {%Ba°%} of 9 (9 are the {%sāmidhenī%} verses for the {%Pitṛs,%} etc.),
<div n="lb">{%A°%} of 10 (10 are the cardinal points, etc.), {%Ba°%} of 11 (11 are
<div n="lb">the {%ekādaśinas%} of the creatures, see Nīl., 11 are there the
<div n="lb">{%yūpas,%} etc.), {%A°%} of 12 (12 months, etc.). As {%Bandin%} had said
<div n="lb">the first half-{%śloka%} with 13 (the 13th {%tithi%} is deemed most
<div n="lb">auspicious, 13 are the islands of the earth), he stopped, and
<div n="lb">{%Aṣṭāvakra%} fulfilled the {%śloka. Bandin%} was then deemed to be
<div n="lb">vanquished, and at the request of {%Aṣṭāvakra%} he merged into
<div n="lb">the sea, after he had declared himself to be the son of {%Varuṇa%}
<div n="lb">and that he had caused the {%brahmans%} to be drowned in order
<div n="lb">that they might see the twelve years {%sattra%} of {%Varuṇa%} that
<div n="lb">was performed simultaneously with that of {%Janaka.%} They
<div n="lb">at once reappeared, and {%Kahoda%} let {%Aṣṭāvakra%} bathe in the
<div n="lb">river {%Samaṅgā,%} and all his limbs were immediately made
<div n="lb">straight, and the {%Samaṅgā%} became a remover of sin. “There-
<div n="lb">fore you also should bathe there” (III, {@134@}).
