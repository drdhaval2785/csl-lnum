{@Dvaitavanapraveśa(ḥ)@}¦ (“proceeding to the Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">forest”) (cf. Arjunābhigamanap.). § 322: The {%Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb">with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Dhaumya,%} on costly chariots yoked with
<div n="lb">excellent steeds, went into the forest, distributing niṣkas of
<div n="lb">gold, etc., to brahmans versed in {%Śikṣā%} (i.e., vedic pronuncia-
<div n="lb">tion, PCR., or “grammar and the other vedāṅgas,” Nīl.),
<div n="lb">{%akṣara%} (= vedic orthography, PCR.; = veda, Nīl.), and
<div n="lb">{%mantras%} (= {%praṇava,%} i.e. the syllable {%oṃ,%} Nīl.), and followed
<div n="lb">by twenty attendants with bows, etc., while {%Indrasena,%} with
<div n="lb">the princess's (i.e. {%Subhadrā's,%} Nīl.) clothes and ornaments
<div n="lb">and the nurses and maidservants, followed in a chariot.
<div n="lb">The citizens walked round {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and the brahmans
<div n="lb">and principal men of {%Kurujāṅgala%} of all castes saluted him
<div n="lb">and blamed the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} etc. {%Arjuna%} told them that
<div n="lb">after their exile they would take away the good name of
<div n="lb">their enemies, and asked them to beseech the ascetics for their
<div n="lb">good. At last they returned to their respective abodes (III,
<div n="lb">{@23@}). After a conference between {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">they resolved upon dwelling for these twelve years at the
<div n="lb">sacred lake {%Dvaitavana%} (see BR.) in the forest of the same
<div n="lb">name (copious description), on the banks of {%Bhogavatī%} (i.e.
<div n="lb">Sarasvati, Nīl.), surrounded by many brahmans, and saluted
[Page281-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">by hosts of {%Cāraṇas%} and {%Siddhas,%} who came to see {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} (III, {@24@}).—§ 323: While they were dwelling there,
<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya%} performed their {%iṣṭis%} (i.e. {%darśa-paurṇamāsa,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">Nīl.) and offerings to the {%Pitṛs,%} etc. Once the old {%ṛṣi%}
<div n="lb">{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} came to them and smiled, recollecting {%Rāma%}
<div n="lb">{%Dāśarathi,%} whom he had seen on the top of the {%Ṛṣyamūka,%} and
<div n="lb">comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by reminding him of the aforesaid {%Rāma,%}
<div n="lb">{%Nābhāga, Bhagīratha,%} etc., and {%Alarka,%} the king of the {%Kāśis%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Karūṣas (b),%} the seven {%ṛṣis,%} who had followed the
<div n="lb">ordinance of the Creator and therefore blazed in the firmament;
<div n="lb">“so you will regain prosperity.” Then he went away in a
<div n="lb">northerly direction (III, {@25@}).—§ 324: The {%Dvaitavana%} forest
<div n="lb">becoming filled with brahmans ({%Bhṛgus, Āṅgirasas, Vāsiṣṭhas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kāśyapas, Āgastyas, Ātreyas,%} etc.), and always resounding with
<div n="lb">Vedic recitations, mingling with the twangs of the bows of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} a beautiful union of {%brahman%} and {%kṣatriya%} customs
<div n="lb">was produced. Therefore one evening the {%ṛṣi Baka Dālbhya%}
<div n="lb">represented to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that the {%kṣatriya%} should always
<div n="lb">consult with a brahman, as did the {%Asura%} king {%Bali,%} the son
<div n="lb">of {%Virocana,%} who went to no other {%tīrtha%} than the brahmans,
<div n="lb">and then had all his wishes gratified, but who met with
<div n="lb">destruction when he began to act unjustly towards them.
<div n="lb">Then all those brahmans, {%Dvaipāyana, Nārada, Jāmadagnya,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (enumeration) {%(a),%} praised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (III, {@26@}).
