<div n="lb">§ 395: At this time (cf. Arjuna Kārtavīrya, § 394), while
<div n="lb">{%Gādhi,%} the king of {%Kānyakubja,%} was dwelling in the wood,
<div n="lb">there was born to him a beautiful daughter, {%Satyavatī,%} whom
<div n="lb">{%Ṛcīka Bhārgava%} asked in marriage. {%Gādhi%} said that, according
<div n="lb">to a family custom, the bridegroom must give a dowry of 1,000
<div n="lb">brown steeds with a single sable ear each (so PCR. translates
<div n="lb">{%ekataḥ śyāmakarṇāṇāṃ,%} cf. V, 3740, and Gālavacarita). {%Ṛcīka%}
<div n="lb">obtained them from {%Varuṇa%} (the spot where the horses ap-
<div n="lb">peared was thence named Aśvatīrtha) and married {%Satyavatī%}
<div n="lb">in {%Kānyakubja%} on the {%Gaṅgā,%} the very gods being companions
<div n="lb">of the bridegroom {%(janyāḥ).%} Then his father {%Bhṛgu%} came
<div n="lb">to see him and his wife, and being pleased with {%Satyavatī,%}
<div n="lb">granted her the boon that a son should be born to herself and
<div n="lb">to her mother, telling her that during their season they should
<div n="lb">embrace, her mother an {%aśvattha%} tree and herself an {%udumbara%}
<div n="lb">tree, and eat two pots of rice and milk {%(caru)%} which he had
<div n="lb">prepared, having ransacked the whole universe. Then {%Bhṛgu%}
<div n="lb">disappeared. They, however, made an interchange both of
<div n="lb">the pots and of the trees which they embraced. Knowing
<div n="lb">this by his divine knowledge, {%Bhṛgu%} came once more and told
<div n="lb">{%Satyavatī%} that she had been deluded by her mother, and that
<div n="lb">therefore she would give birth to a brahman of kṣatriya
<div n="lb">character {%(kṣatravṛttiḥ)%} and her mother to a kṣatriya
<div n="lb">of brahman character {%(brāhmaṇācāraḥ).%} At her repeated
<div n="lb">entreaties, however, he granted her that not her son but her
<div n="lb">grandson should be of that description. The son of {%Satyavatī%}
<div n="lb">was {%J.,%} who excelled many ṛṣis in Vedic lore {%(Vedādhyayanena),%}
<div n="lb">and to whom the whole Dhanurveda appeared spontaneously
<div n="lb">{%(pratyabhāt),%} and likewise the four kinds of weapon {%(astrāṇi):%}
<div n="lb">III, {@115,@} 10167.—§ 396: {%J.%} devoted himself to the study of
<div n="lb">the {%Veda%} and to penances. He married {%Reṇukā,%} the daughter
<div n="lb">of king {%Prasenajit,%} and lived with her in his hermitage
<div n="lb">practising austerities. She gave birth to five sons, of whom
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} was the youngest. Once when {%Reṇukā%} had been
<div n="lb">filled with desire, seeing the {%Mārttikāvata%} king {%Citraratha%}
<div n="lb">bathing, together with his wife, {%J.%} ordered his sons {%Rumaṇvat%}
<div n="lb">the eldest), {%Suṣeṇa, Vasu,%} and {%Viśvāvasu%} to kill their
<div n="lb">mother, but as they refused to do so he cursed them, so that
<div n="lb">they lost their senses and behaved like beasts and birds.
<div n="lb">Then he ordered {%Rāma%} to do it, and he immediately severed
<div n="lb">her head with an axe, and then prevailed upon {%J.%} to grant him
<div n="lb">that {%Reṇukā%} might be restored to life and not remember that
<div n="lb">she had been slain, that he himself might not be affected by
<div n="lb">this sin, that his brothers might recover their former state,
<div n="lb">and that he himself might be unrivalled on the field of battle
<div n="lb">and obtain a long life: III, {@116,@} 10183, 10185, 10188.—
<div n="lb">§ 397: Once when the sons of {%J.%} had gone out, {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">{%Kārtavīrya,%} the lord of the country near the seashore
<div n="lb">{%(Anūpapatiḥ),%} came to the hermitage, and, though he was
<div n="lb">praised by {%Reṇukā,%} he carried away the calf of the {%homadhenu%}
<div n="lb">and pulled down the trees. {%J.%} told this to {%Rāma,%} who then
<div n="lb">rushed towards {%Arjuna%} and cut down his 1,000 arms with his
<div n="lb">arrows and at last killed him. Then the sons of {%Arjuna%} came
<div n="lb">while {%Rāma%} was away, and with their arrows killed {%J.,%} who
<div n="lb">did not fight, but repeatedly shouted the name of {%Rāma.%} When
<div n="lb">they had gone away, {%Rāma%} returned to the hermitage: III,
