{@Vṛddhakanyā@}¦ (“old virgin”). § 615 (Baladevatīrtha-
<div n="lb">yātrā): IX, {@51,@} †2978.—§ 615{%u%} (do.): The ṛṣi {%Kuṇi-Garga%}
<div n="lb">by penances created a fair daughter from his mind and then
<div n="lb">went to heaven. She worshipped the {%Pitṛs%} and the gods
<div n="lb">with fasts and practised penances in that solitary forest not
<div n="lb">wishing to marry, as she did not see a husband worthy of
<div n="lb">her. When she could no longer move, she set her heart
<div n="lb">upon departing for the other world. {%Nārada%} told her that
<div n="lb">she had no regions of blessedness to obtain, not having
<div n="lb">cleansed herself by the rite of marriage. She then went to
<div n="lb">a concourse of {%ṛṣis,%} and said that she would give half her
<div n="lb">penances to him who would accept her hand in marriage.
<div n="lb">{%Gālava's%} son, the ṛṣi {%Prākśṛṅgavat,%} accepted her hand on
<div n="lb">condition that he should live with her only one night. On
<div n="lb">that night she became a young lady of the finest complexion,
<div n="lb">etc., and {%Gālava's%} son became very happy. At morn she
<div n="lb">said: “he that will, with rapt attention, pass one night in
<div n="lb">this tīrtha after having gratified the gods with oblations of
<div n="lb">water, shall obtain the merit of the vow of {%brahmacarya%} for
<div n="lb">58 years,” and then she departed for heaven. He soon
<div n="lb">followed her, moved by sorrow: IX, {@52,@} 3003.
