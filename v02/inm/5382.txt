{@[Kapota-lubdhaka-saṃvāda(ḥ)]@}¦ (“the conversation
<div n="lb">between the dove and the fowler”). § 651{%b%} (Āpaddh.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhārgava%} related: A cruel fowler (description) was surprised
<div n="lb">in the forest by a great storm (description); the paths of
<div n="lb">the forest were all submerged; he caught a she-pigeon and
<div n="lb">immured her in a cage; when the sky cleared he passed the
<div n="lb">night under a tree, having bowed down to the deities that
<div n="lb">had this tree for their resort (XII, {@143@}). In one of the
<div n="lb">branches of that tree the male pigeon lamented the loss of his
<div n="lb">wife (XII, {@144@}). The she-pigeon answered him from within
<div n="lb">the hunter's cage, telling him to do the duties of hospitality
<div n="lb">to the fowler (XII, {@145@}). The male pigeon welcomed the
<div n="lb">fowler, who was stiff with cold, by igniting a fire; as the
<div n="lb">fowler was hungry, the pigeon (quoting Ṛ., D., and P.) him-
<div n="lb">self entered the fire, at which the fowler became terrified,
<div n="lb">thinking of his own cruel life (XII, {@146@}), expressed his
<div n="lb">repentance, and set at liberty the she-pigeon, etc. (XII, {@147@}).
<div n="lb">The she-pigeon lamented for the death of her spouse; then
<div n="lb">she threw herself into the blazing fire; the couple of pigeons
<div n="lb">ascended to heaven (XII, {@148@}). The fowler took to rigid
<div n="lb">penances, perished in a forest conflagration, and beheld him-
<div n="lb">self in heaven in splendour like {%Indra%} among Y. and G. and
<div n="lb">Si. (XII, {@149@}).
