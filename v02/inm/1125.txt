<div n="lb">having heard that the {%ṛṣis Baka%} and {%Dālbhya%} were long-
<div n="lb">lived and friends of {%Indra,%} asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} about the
<div n="lb">meeting of {%Baka%} and {%Indra. Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: After
<div n="lb">the conflict between the gods and {%asuras%} was over, and {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">had become the ruler of the three worlds, all people were
<div n="lb">happy and virtuous. Once {%Indra,%} riding on {%Airāvata,%} surveyed
<div n="lb">his happy subjects, and, descending to earth, he made a visit
<div n="lb">to the {%ṛṣi Baka,%} who had lived for 100,000 years and was
<div n="lb">adored by gods and {%ṛṣis%} ({%?devarṣigaṇasevita,%} v. 13236;
<div n="lb">PCR. has the accus.), in his hermitage in the east by the
<div n="lb">seaside. {%Indra%} asked him about the sorrows of those who
<div n="lb">have a long life. {%Baka%} mentioned several common disagreeable
<div n="lb">things, and finally, the having to witness the injustices that
<div n="lb">take place. {%Indra%} then asked him about their joys; he
<div n="lb">mentioned the frugal life of a pious {%brahman,%} who only eats
<div n="lb">after having waited on his guest.
