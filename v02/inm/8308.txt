<div n="lb">Wind and Arjuna Kārtavīrya”). § 772{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: The {%Haihaya%} king {%Arjuna Kārtavīrya,%} with
<div n="lb">1,000 arms, became the lord of the whole of this world
<div n="lb">(i.e. the earth) [residing] in {%Māhiṣmatī;%} he gave large
<div n="lb">gifts to {%Dattātreya,%} who granted him four boons: that he
<div n="lb">should have 1,000 arms in battle, but only two at home; that
<div n="lb">he should subjugate the whole earth righteously, and sway her
<div n="lb">with vigilance; and that whenever he might happen to go
<div n="lb">wrong, the righteous should set him right. {%A.%} now regarded
<div n="lb">himself as having no equal. A celestial voice said that
<div n="lb">the brahman is superior to the {%kṣatriya; A.%} maintained
<div n="lb">that the brahmans take refuge with the {%kṣatriyas;%} what
<div n="lb">the virgin {%Gāyatrī%} had said from the sky was not true
<div n="lb">({%asatyaṃ,%} so B. and Nīl.). “I shall bring the skin-clad
<div n="lb">brahmans under my subjection.” At these words of {%A.%} the
<div n="lb">invisible goddess {%(Gāyatrī)%} became agitated ({%vitrastā 'bhūn%}
<div n="lb">{%niśācarī;%} cf. Nīl.). Then {%Vāyu%} (wind) warned {%A.,%} addressing
<div n="lb">him from the air. Asked by {%A.%} what kind of earthly
<div n="lb">creature the brahman is, if he resembles the wind, water,
<div n="lb">fire, sun, or sky (XIII, {@153@}), {%Vāyu%} praised the brahmans
<div n="lb">above all, citing {%Kaśyapa (c), Aṅgiras (d), Gautama (e),%}
<div n="lb">{%[Kapila] (f), Aurva (g),%} and {%Dattātreya;%} even {%Agni (h)%} and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán (i)%} are brahmans; the large kingdom of the
<div n="lb">{%Daṇḍakas%} was destroyed by a brahman; the ocean, that was
<div n="lb">full of crystal water, cursed by the brahmans, became saline
<div n="lb">in taste. {%Arjuna%} remained silent (XIII, {@154@}). {%Vāyu%} repeated
<div n="lb">the story of {%Kaśyapa%} in detail, and asked {%Arjuna%} if he knew
<div n="lb">a {%kṣatriya%} superior to {%Kaśyapa. Arjuna%} remained silent.
<div n="lb">Then {%Vāyu%} related the story of {%Utathya (j)%} (XIII, {@155@}).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} remained silent. {%Vāyu%} then described the greatness
<div n="lb">of {%Agastya (k). Arjuna%} remained silent. {%Vāyu%} related a feat
<div n="lb">of {%Vasiṣṭha's (l)%} (XIII, {@156@}). {%Arjuna%} remained silent.
<div n="lb">{%Vāyu%} related a feat of {%Atri's (m). Arjuna%} remained silent.
<div n="lb">{%Vāyu%} related a feat of {%Cyavana's (n)%} (XIII, {@157@}). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">remained silent. {%Vāyu%} related the history of the {%Kapas%}
<div n="lb">{%(p). Arjuna%} praised the brahmans, mentioning {%Dattātreya.%}
<div n="lb">{%Vāyu%} told him always to protect them; “a terrible danger
<div n="lb">threatens thee from the {%Bhṛgus;%} that will take place after
<div n="lb">a time” (XIII, {@158@}).
