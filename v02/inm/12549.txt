[{@Yakṣayuddhaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the combat with the
<div n="lb">Yakṣas”, the 38th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
<div n="lb">cf. Yakṣayuddha). § 436. The Pāṇḍavas, etc., returned
<div n="lb">to the hermitage of {%Nārāyaṇa.%} Once {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said to
<div n="lb">them: “We have passed these four years in the woods; it
<div n="lb">has been appointed by {%Arjuna,%} that after the fifth year he
<div n="lb">will come to the mountain {%Śveta.%}” They then set out with
<div n="lb">the brahmans and the {%Rākṣasas,%} and protected by {%Lomaśa,%}
<div n="lb">sometimes going on foot, sometimes carried by the {%Rākṣasas,%}
<div n="lb">towards the north, beholding on the way the mountains
<div n="lb">{%Maināka, Gandhamādana,%} and {%Śveta,%} and on the seventeenth
<div n="lb">day they reached the slopes of {%Himavat,%} not far from
<div n="lb">{%Gandhamādana,%} and were received by R.-ṛ. {%Vṛṣaparvan%} in
<div n="lb">his hermitage, where they passed seven nights. On the
<div n="lb">eighth day they entrusted their remaining robes, their
<div n="lb">sacrificial vessels, ornaments, and jewels to {%Vṛṣaparvan,%}
<div n="lb">and, following his instructions, set out for the north, on foot,
<div n="lb">with {%Dhaumya, Kṛṣṇā,%} and {%Lomaśa.%} On the fourth day
<div n="lb">they reached {%Śveta,%} and entered {%Gandhamādana (b)%} with
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} and the brahmans, and saw the great {%Gaṅgā (c).%}
<div n="lb">Thereafter, they went to the hermitage of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} (III,
<div n="lb">{@158@}). {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} received the four {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Dhaumya,%} and said that during the {%parvan%} days {%ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">living upon water and air and moving through the sky come
<div n="lb">to this mountain, sounds of kettledrums, etc., being heard
<div n="lb">on the summits, and that they should not attempt to
<div n="lb">proceed further, but wait for {%Arjuna%} there, as they could not
<div n="lb">go beyond {%Kailāsa(d)%} (III, {@159@}).—§ 437. They passed the
<div n="lb">fifth year in the hermitage of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa,%} eating flesh of
<div n="lb">deer killed with unpoisoned shafts, listening to the stories
<div n="lb">told by {%Lomaśa. Ghaṭotkaca%} had departed, promising to be
<div n="lb">present when occasion arose. {%Munis%} and {%Cāraṇas%} visited
<div n="lb">them. One day {%Suparṇa%} carried off a mighty {%Nāga%} from the
<div n="lb">lake, while the mountain trembled, etc., and the wind, raised
<div n="lb">by {%Suparṇa's%} wings, brought celestial flowers of five colours
<div n="lb">before the Pāṇḍavas towards the river {%Aśvarathā. Kṛṣṇā%}
<div n="lb">expressed to {%Bhīma%} the wish of seeing the top of the
[Page765-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">mountain when he had driven away the {%Rākṣasas. Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">set out with bow, sword, and mace, and having ascended the
<div n="lb">summit, thereby gladdening {%Kinnaras, Nāgas, Munis, Gan-%}
<div n="lb">{%dharvas,%} and {%Rākṣasas,%} he blew his shell. {%Yakṣas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas%} ({%Krodhavaśāḥ,%} v. 11757) assailed him with maces,
<div n="lb">clubs, etc., but were killed or defeated, and the surviving
<div n="lb">fled towards the south, forsaking their weapons. The
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasa Maṇimat,%} the friend of {%Kubera,%} in vain attempted
<div n="lb">to recall them, and with clubs, javelins, etc., he rushed at
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} and pierced his right arm with an iron spear with a
<div n="lb">golden haft, but at last was killed by {%Bhīma%} with his mace.
<div n="lb">The surviving {%Rākṣasas%} went towards the east (III, {@160@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 438. Hearing various sounds and not seeing {%Bhīma,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇā,%} and {%Dhaumya%} and the brahmans were
<div n="lb">filled with anxiety, and, entrusting {%Draupadī%} to the charge
<div n="lb">of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa,%} they ascended the summit of the mountain
<div n="lb">and embraced {%Bhīma,%} who was censured and again warned by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Kubera,%} on hearing about the matter from the
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas,%} in anger let yoke his carriage, and, eulogized by
<div n="lb">the gods and {%Gandharvas,%} and surrounded by 1,000 {%Yakṣas,%}
<div n="lb">he set out through the firmament to {%Gandhamādana,%} where
<div n="lb">he seated himself on his seat {%Puṣpaka (b),%} surrounded by
<div n="lb">{%Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas,%} and {%Apsarases,%} with his
<div n="lb">noose and sword and bow, and asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} not to be
<div n="lb">angry with {%Bhīma%} as {%Bhīma%} had only been the instrument of
<div n="lb">destiny, and said to {%Bhīma%} that he did not mind his act of
<div n="lb">rashness as he had thereby been delivered from the curse
<div n="lb">of {%Agastya (c)%} (III, {@161@}). {%Kubera%} then gave {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">some wise counsel, referring to the {%Kṛta-yuga(d);%} he said,
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ought to check the rashness of {%Bhīmasena;%}
<div n="lb">they should return to the hermitage of the R.-ṛ {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%}
<div n="lb">and reside there during the first dark fortnight; the
<div n="lb">inhabitants of {%Alakā%} with {%Gandharvas,%} and {%Yakṣas%} with
<div n="lb">{%Kinnaras,%} etc., should, at the command of {%Kubera,%} protect
<div n="lb">them, and his servants procure for them meat and drink;
<div n="lb">he praised {%Arjuna (e). Arjuna%} would soon join them. Then
<div n="lb">{%Kubera%} went to the mountain {%Asta,%} followed by thousands of
<div n="lb">{%Yakṣas%} and {%Rākṣasas%} in vehicles drawn by horses flying in
<div n="lb">the air. The dead bodies of the {%Rākṣasas%} were, at the
<div n="lb">command of {%Kubera,%} removed. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} dwelt several
<div n="lb">nights there, being honoured by the {%Rākṣasas%} (III, {@162@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 439. At sunrise, {%Dhaumya%} and {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} came to them,
<div n="lb">and {%Dhaumya,%} seizing {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} hands, pointed out,
<div n="lb">towards the east, the {%Mandara%} mountain, the east being the
<div n="lb">region of {%Indra%} and {%Vaiśravaṇa,%} as the {%South%} is that of {%Yama%}
<div n="lb">with his abode {%Saṃyamana,%} and the {%Asta%} mountain, where
<div n="lb">the sun sets in the west, that of {%Varuṇa,%} together with the
<div n="lb">ocean; in the north {%Meru,%} with the dwelling of {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">where {%Prajāpati%} creates all creatures, and the seven mind-
<div n="lb">born sons of {%Brahmán%} (of whom {%Dakṣa%} was the seventh),
<div n="lb">and where the seven {%Devarṣis%} (i.e. {%Saptarṣayaḥ%}), with
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha%} at their head, rise and set; next, to the east of
<div n="lb">{%Meru,%} the abode of {%Nārāyaṇa%} or {%Viṣṇu,%} that cannot be seen
<div n="lb">by gods or {%Dānavas,%} and where even {%Brahmarṣis%} have no
<div n="lb">access, not to speak of {%Maharṣis,%} but only {%Yatis;%} thence,
<div n="lb">they do not return to this world; {%Viṣṇu%} alone shines there.
<div n="lb">Description of the revolving around {%Meru%} of the sun, moon,
<div n="lb">and stars (“having coursed round {%Meru,%} the moon again
<div n="lb">repairs to {%Mandara%}”, v. ii, 873) (III, {@163@}).—§ 440. The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} dwelled there for a month, visited by {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Maharṣis.%} A night and a day became to them like a
<div n="lb">year, for since the departure of {%Arjuna,%} they had not felt
<div n="lb">joy. After having dwelt for five years in the abode of {%Indra%}
[Page766-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">and obtained all celestial weapons from him, {%Āgneya, Vāruṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Saumya, Vāyavya, Vaiṣṇava, Aindra, Pāśuvata, Brāhmya,%}
<div n="lb">{%Pārameṣṭhya,%} and those of {%Prajāpati, Yama, Dhātṛ, Savitṛ,%}
<div n="lb">{%Tvaṣṭṛ,%} and {%Vaiśravaṇa, Arjuna%} took leave of {%Indra%} and
<div n="lb">came to {%Gandhamādana%} (III, {@164@}).
