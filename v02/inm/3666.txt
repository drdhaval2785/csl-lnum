[{@Draupadī-sambhava(ḥ)@}]¦ (“origin of Draupadī”).
<div n="lb">§ 218 (Caitrarathap.): Distressed and thinking of revenging
<div n="lb">himself on {%Droṇa,%} not contented with his children and relatives,
<div n="lb">king {%Drupada%} wandered along the {%Yamunā%} and the {%Gangā%} and
<div n="lb">came to a hermitage of {%brahmans,%} and prevailed upon {%Yāja (b)%}
<div n="lb">to perform a sacrifice for him, assisted by his brother {%Upayāja,%}
<div n="lb">in order to obtain a son who might slay {%Droṇa.%} Then {%Yāja%}
<div n="lb">summoned the queen ({%Pṛṣatī,%} v. 6390; {%Pārṣatī,%} v. 6405;
<div n="lb">“daughter-in-law of {%Pṛṣata,%}” PCR.), but she said that she
<div n="lb">was not fit for accepting the offspring (?), her mouth being
<div n="lb">unclean {%(avalipta)%} and her person perfumed. {%Yāja%} replied:
<div n="lb">“Since the sacrifice has been prepared {%(śrapitaṃ)%} by {%Yāja%}
<div n="lb">and sanctified by {%Upayāja's%} invocations {%(abhimantritaṃ),%} it
<div n="lb">shall produce its effect whether thou comest or waitest.”
<div n="lb">Then arose from the flames a boy with a crown on his head,
<div n="lb">his body being arrayed in excellent armour, sword in hand
<div n="lb">and carrying a bow and arrows, sending forth loud roars, and
<div n="lb">immediately ascending a chariot. A great invisible being in
<div n="lb">the skies said that he would destroy {%Droṇa,%} etc. After this
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālī%} arose from the centre of the {%vedī,%} and a voice, not
<div n="lb">coming from a visible body, said that she would be the cause
<div n="lb">of the destruction of many {%kṣatriyas.%} At the birth of
<div n="lb">both children the {%Pāñcālas%} shouted with joy. The queen
<div n="lb">was regarded as their mother. Then the {%brahmans%} gave to
<div n="lb">the boy the name of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} on account of his
<div n="lb">audacity, etc. ({%dhṛṣṭatvād atidhṛṣṇutvād dyumnādyutsam-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhavād api,%} v. 6406), and to the girl that of {%Kṛṣṇā,%} on
<div n="lb">account of her dark complexion (v. 6407). {%Droṇa%} brought
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to his own abode, and taught him the use
<div n="lb">of all weapons, considering that destiny is inevitable (I, {@167@}).
