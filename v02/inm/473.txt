[{@Amṛtamanthana@}]¦ (“churning of the Amṛta or Am-
<div n="lb">brosia”). Cf. Āstīkaparvan. § 28: Once the gods having
<div n="lb">assembled on the summit of Mount Meru, Nārāyaṇa told
<div n="lb">Brahmán to churn the Ocean with the gods and the Asuras,
<div n="lb">in order to obtain Amṛta (I, {@17@}). Viṣṇu and Brahmán
<div n="lb">prevailed upon Ananta (i.e. Śeṣa), the prince of Snakes,
<div n="lb">to bring up the mountain Mandara. The gods having
<div n="lb">obtained from the Ocean the permission to churn it, Indra
<div n="lb">placed Mandara on the back of the Tortoise-king; Mandara
<div n="lb">was made the churning staff and Vāsuki the cord, the
<div n="lb">Asuras holding him by the hood and the gods by the tail,
<div n="lb">while Ananta, who sided with Nārāyaṇa, at intervals raised the
<div n="lb">snake's hood and suddenly lowered it. Black vapours with
<div n="lb">flames issued from Vāsuki's mouth, etc. After some churning
[Page035-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the gums of various trees and herbs mingled with the waters
<div n="lb">of the Ocean, and the milky water produced clarified butter,
<div n="lb">but even then the Amṛta did not appear. The gods were
<div n="lb">tired and repaired to Brahmán, who prevailed upon Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb">to grant the gods new strength to churn afresh. After
<div n="lb">a while the Moon, Śrī, Surādevī (wine), Ucchaiḥ-
<div n="lb">śravas, and Kaustubha came forth on the side of the
<div n="lb">gods; then Dhanvantari with a white vessel of Amṛta
<div n="lb">in his hand; then Airāvaṇa, and at last the poison
<div n="lb">Kālakūṭa, that Śiva, solicited by Brahmán, swallowed
<div n="lb">for the safety of the creation; from that time Śiva is called
<div n="lb">Nīlakaṇṭha (‘Blue-neck’). The Asuras preparing to rob
<div n="lb">the gods of Śrī and the Amṛta, Nārāyaṇa, assisted by his
<div n="lb">{%māyā%} (‘illusion’), assumed a ravishing female form; the
<div n="lb">Dānavas and Daityas were infatuated, and placed the Amṛta
<div n="lb">in her hands (I, {@18@}). While the Daityas and Dānavas
<div n="lb">pursued the gods, Viṣṇu with Nara let the gods drink of
<div n="lb">the Amṛta; the Dānava Rāhu also drank of it in the disguise
<div n="lb">of a god, but was discovered by Sūrya (i.e. the Sun) and
<div n="lb">Soma (i.e. the Moon); then Nārāyaṇa instantly seized his
<div n="lb">discus and cut off his head, which to this day swallows Sūrya
<div n="lb">and Soma. In a dreadful battle on the shores of the salt-
<div n="lb">water sea the gods, headed by Nārāyaṇa with his discus
<div n="lb">Sudarśana and Nara with his celestial bow, discomfited the
<div n="lb">Asuras, who entered the bowels of the earth or plunged into
<div n="lb">the sea of salt waters. The gods replaced Mandara on its
<div n="lb">own base, and, headed by Indra, they entrusted the keeping
<div n="lb">of the vessel of Amṛta to Kirīṭin (i.e. Nara), (I, {@19@}).
