<div n="lb">set his mind on what is subtle; he said: “My mind has
<div n="lb">become strong; having conquered the mind, one's conquest
<div n="lb">becomes permanent; I shall shoot sharp-pointed arrows at
<div n="lb">the mind.” The mind said: “These arrows will never pierce
<div n="lb">me, but only slay thyself; do thou look out for other arrows
<div n="lb">with which to destroy me”; and so also with the nose, the
<div n="lb">tongue, etc. Then he set himself to penances, but failed to
<div n="lb">obtain fit arrows. He engaged in {%yoga,%} and now slew all the
<div n="lb">senses with one arrow. He complained that he [had lost
<div n="lb">his time] in courting sovereignty till now; “there is no
<div n="lb">happiness higher than {%yoga.%}”
