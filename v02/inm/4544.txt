[{@Hradapraveśaparvan@}]¦ (“the section containing Duryo-
<div n="lb">dhana's entering the lake,” the 81st of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mhbhr.; cf. Hradapraveśana). § 612: The followers
<div n="lb">of {%Śakuni%} attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas; Arjuna%} and {%Bhīmasena%}
<div n="lb">came to the rescue of {%Sahadeva; Arjuna%} slew them; {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} rallied the remnants of his chariots (many hundreds),
<div n="lb">etc., and urged them against the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna;%}
<div n="lb">they were exterminated in a moment by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Sṛñjayas.%} Only {%Duryodhana%} remained alive. Requested
<div n="lb">by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} recounted the numbers of the
<div n="lb">remnants of the {%Pāṇḍava%} army. {%Duryodhana%} abandoned his
<div n="lb">slain steeds and fled away on foot without a companion,
<div n="lb">towards a lake, taking up his mace, recalling the words of
[Page325-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Vidura.%} The {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}) with
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} (with {%Gāṇḍīva%}) baffled the {%Kurus.%} In {%Duryodhana's%}
<div n="lb">army no great chariot-warrior was alive save {%Aśvatthāman,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Urged by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Sātyaki%} was about to
<div n="lb">slay {%Sañjaya;%} but {%Vyāsa%} came and caused him to be let off
<div n="lb">alive. He met with {%Duryodhana,%} whom he told the state of
<div n="lb">things, and who asked him to inform {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} Then
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} having charmed the waters, entered the lake.
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} then met with {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and informed
<div n="lb">them; they fled away, at sight of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} to the {%Kuru%}
<div n="lb">camp, taking {%Sañjaya%} up in the chariot of {%Kṛpa.%} The sun
<div n="lb">had set a little before. The outposts of the camp wept
<div n="lb">aloud. The old men proceeded towards the city with the
<div n="lb">princesses (description); also the camp-guards fled towards
<div n="lb">the city, and so did also the cowherds, etc., from fear of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena. Yuyutsu%} reflected (<lang n="greek"></lang>). With the permission of
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} he supervised the removal of the ladies. The
<div n="lb">sun was setting. Having entered {%Hāstinapura%} with the
<div n="lb">ladies, he informed {%Vidura%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); urged by {%Vidura,%} he passed
<div n="lb">that night in his own abode, while {%Vidura%} went to the
<div n="lb">cheerless mansion of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (IX, {@29@}). Requested by
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Sañjaya%} related: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} wandered
<div n="lb">over the field in search of {%Duryodhana;%} tired, they took rest
<div n="lb">in their camp with all their soldiers. Then {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) proceeded towards the lake and urged {%Duryodhana%} to fight
<div n="lb">with them against {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana%} said that he
<div n="lb">would rest for that night and fight the next morning.
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} swore to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and all the {%Pāñcālas%}
<div n="lb">in this night. Certain hunters who used every day to procure
<div n="lb">a basketful of meat for {%Bhīmasena%} overheard the conversation
<div n="lb">between {%Duryodhana%} and {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and informed
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena.%} The {%Pāṇḍavas%} all ({%Arjuna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) with {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%}) started towards the lake {%(Dvaipāyana);%} hearing the
<div n="lb">noise caused by them {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), took leave from
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} and went away, and stopped under a banyan
<div n="lb">(IX, {@30@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} advised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to slay {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">by putting forth his own powers of illusion (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">tauntingly addressed {%Duryodhana%} for having fled from battle
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Duryodhana%} said that he had entered the lake not
<div n="lb">from fear, but in order to take rest. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} to come out immediately and fight his foes.
<div n="lb">He answered that his kingdom might be taken by his foes,
<div n="lb">his own desire being to enter the woods and retire from the
<div n="lb">world (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} taunted him for such an answer,
<div n="lb">refusing to take the kingdom in gift from one who was
<div n="lb">unable to retain it by might (IX, {@31@}).
