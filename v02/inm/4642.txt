[{@Indra-Mataṅga-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation
<div n="lb">between Indra and Mataṅga”). § 735{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: Once a brahman obtained a son named
<div n="lb">{%Mataṅga,%} who, though procreated by a person of a different
<div n="lb">order, had, however, the rites of infancy and youth performed
<div n="lb">according to the ordinances laid down for brahmans. His
<div n="lb">father, desiring to perform a sacrifice, ordered him to collect
<div n="lb">the articles, and he set out riding in a car drawn by a young
<div n="lb">ass, that bore away the car to its mother; {%Mataṅga%} repeatedly
<div n="lb">struck the animal with his goad on its nose; but the old
<div n="lb">she-ass consoled it, saying, “A {%Cāṇḍāla%} it is that is driving
<div n="lb">thee; there is no severity in a brahman.” Asked by {%Mataṅga,%}
<div n="lb">the she-ass revealed to him that his father was a {%Śūdra%}
<div n="lb">following the profession of a barber, who begat him upon
<div n="lb">a brahman woman excited with desire; “thou art, therefore,
<div n="lb">a {%Cāṇḍāla%} by birth.” {%Mataṅga%} returned home, told his father
<div n="lb">what he had heard, retired to the forest, and began to undergo
<div n="lb">the austerest penances in order to acquire the status of
<div n="lb">a brahman, so that he scorched the very deities. {%Indra%} came
<div n="lb">and offered him boons, but the status of a brahman, he said,
<div n="lb">could not be won by penances (XIII, {@27@}). {%Mataṅga%} then
<div n="lb">stood for 100 years on one foot. {%Indra%} came once more and
<div n="lb">said: “From the order of brute life one attains to the state
<div n="lb">of humanity; if born as a human being, one is sure to take
<div n="lb">birth as a {%Pukkaśa%} or a {%Cāṇḍāla;%} after 1,000 years one attains
<div n="lb">to the status of a {%Śūdra;%} then after 30,000 years that of
<div n="lb">a {%Vaiśya;%} after a period that is sixty times longer, that of a
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriya;%} after a period that is sixty times longer than this, to
<div n="lb">that of a fallen {%brahman;%} after a period 200 times as long,
<div n="lb">to that of a brahman living by the profession of arms; after
<div n="lb">a period 300 times as long, to that of a brahman reciting the
<div n="lb">{%Gāyatrī%} and sacred {%mantras;%} after a period 400 times as long,
<div n="lb">to that of a brahman conversant with the entire {%Vedas%} and
<div n="lb">the scriptures” (XIII, {@28@}). {%Mataṅga%} then practised
<div n="lb">austerer penances, standing on one foot for 1,000 years in
<div n="lb">{%yoga%}-meditation. {%Indra%} once more came and said the same.
<div n="lb">{%Mataṅga%} then repaired to {%Gayā,%} and there passed 300 years
<div n="lb">on one foot in {%yoga,%} and was reduced to only skin and bones,
<div n="lb">and dropped down on the ground from sheer exhaustion.
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} came quickly; now {%Mataṅga%} accepted the boons that he
<div n="lb">should be celebrated as {%chandodeva,%} and obtain the worship
<div n="lb">of all women, and his fame should become unrivalled in the
<div n="lb">three worlds (XII, {@29@}).
