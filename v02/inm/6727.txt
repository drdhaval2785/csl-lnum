[{@Mahābhiṣopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“episode relating to king
<div n="lb">Mahābhiṣa”). § 161 (Sambhavap.): The {%rājarṣi Mahā-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhiṣa,%} of the race of {%Ikṣvāku,%} had gratified {%Indra%} by 1,000
<div n="lb">horse sacrifices and 100 {%rājasūyas%} and attained to {%Svarga.%}
<div n="lb">One day, when the gods and {%rājarṣis%} were worshipping
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} the {%Wind%} loosened the garments of {%Gaṅgā.%} The
<div n="lb">gods bent down their heads, but {%Mahābhiṣa%} rudely stared at
<div n="lb">her, and for this {%Brahmán%} cursed him, saying that he should
<div n="lb">be reborn on earth, [as should also {%Gaṅgā,%} but when his
<div n="lb">wrath should be provoked by her he should again attain to
<div n="lb">heaven] (the words in brackets are only to be found in B.).
<div n="lb">He then wished to be born as a son of {%Pratīpa.%} The {%Vasus%}
<div n="lb">had been cursed by the ṛṣi {%Vasiṣṭha,%} whom they had
<div n="lb">crossed when he was engaged in his twilight adorations, that
<div n="lb">they should be born among men. They chose to be born of
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%} as sons to {%Śāntanu,%} who should be borne to {%Pratīpa,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Gaṅgā%} promised that she would throw them into the water
<div n="lb">as soon as they were born, except one, upon whom they
<div n="lb">would each contribute one-eighth of their energies, but who
<div n="lb">should be childless (I, {@96@}). (For continuation v. Śāntanū-
<div n="lb">pākhyāna.)
