{@[Lokapālasabhākhyānaparvan]@}¦ (“the section con-
<div n="lb">taining the description of the palaces of the Lokapālas,”
<div n="lb">the 21st of the minor parvans of the Mahābhārata). (Cf.
<div n="lb">Lokapālasabhākhyāna.)—§ 265: While the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were
<div n="lb">sitting in that palace, with the great {%Gandharvas,%} there came
<div n="lb">unto them the {%devarṣi Nārada%} (his accomplishments are
<div n="lb">enumerated at great length), having wandered over the
<div n="lb">different worlds, accompanied by the {%ṛṣis Pārijāta, Raivata,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sumukta,%} and {%Saumya. Nārada%} informed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about
<div n="lb">religion, pleasure, and profit, in the form of questions about
<div n="lb">his conduct. By following his advice {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} conquered
<div n="lb">the whole earth (II, {@5@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} answered that he
<div n="lb">observed all those rules. Then he asked {%Nārada%} if he had
<div n="lb">ever seen a palace like his. {%Nārada%} ({%Brahmaṛṣiḥ,%} v. 281)
<div n="lb">replied that no palace among men was like his, but that he
<div n="lb">would describe unto him the palaces of {%Pitṛrāja%} (i.e. {%Yama%}),
<div n="lb">{%Varuṇa, Indra,%} the dweller on {%Kailāsa%} (i.e. {%Kubera%}), and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} always worshipped by gods, {%Pitṛs%} and {%Sādhyas,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(II, {@6@}).—§ 266: {%Śakrasabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 267: {%Yama-%}
<div n="lb">{%sabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 268: {%Varuṇasabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 269: {%Vaiśravaṇasabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 270: {%Brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%sabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 271: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said: It appears
<div n="lb">that almost all the monarchs are in the sabhā of {%Yama%}—the
<div n="lb">{%Nāgas, Daityas,%} rivers, and oceans in that of {%Varuṇa%}—the
<div n="lb">{%Yakṣas, Guhyakas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Apsarases,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Śiva%} in that of {%Kubera%}—the great {%ṛṣis,%} and gods, and {%śāstras%}
<div n="lb">in that of {%Pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}); and in that of {%Śakra%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Indra%}) gods, {%Gandharvas%} and various {%ṛṣis,%} but only one
<div n="lb">king, the {%rājarṣi Hariścandra (b);%} this is explained by
<div n="lb">{%Nārada. Pāṇḍu,%} beholding the good fortune of {%Hariścandra,%}
<div n="lb">had asked {%Nārada%} to tell {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to subjugate the
<div n="lb">whole earth and then perform a {%rājasūya.%} Thereby also
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍu%} and his ancestors would go to the region of {%Indra.%}
<div n="lb">{%Brahmarakṣases,%} that destroy the sacrifices, always look
<div n="lb">for opportunities of obstructing it. Then {%Nārada%} went away
<div n="lb">to the city of the {%Dāśārhas,%} accompanied by the {%ṛṣis%} with
<div n="lb">whom he had come (II, {@12@}).
