{@Aśvamedhika(ṃ) parva(n)@}¦ (“the section treating of the
<div n="lb">Horse-sacrifice,” the 93rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
<div n="lb">cf. Āśvamedhika(ṃ) parva(n)). § 778: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said
<div n="lb">(XIV, 1): After {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had offered libations of water
<div n="lb">[to Bhīṣma], {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} fell down in grief on the bank of
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā.%} Incited by {%Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma%} took him up, surrounded
<div n="lb">by the {%Pāṇḍavas; Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} comforts him, saying that it
<div n="lb">is he and {%Gāndhārī%} who ought to grieve, and referring to
<div n="lb">{%Vidura's%} advice about abandoning {%Duryodhana%} and his
<div n="lb">warnings against {%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%} (XIV, 1). {%Kṛṣṇa%} also
<div n="lb">exhorts him, referring to the duties of the {%kṣattriyas%} expounded
<div n="lb">by {%Bhīṣma, Vyāsa, Nārada,%} and {%Vidura. Yudhiṣṭhira%} cannot
<div n="lb">forget the slaughter of {%Karṇa. Vyāsa%} also comforts him
<div n="lb">(XIV, {@2@}), and reminding him that D. and As. perform
<div n="lb">sacrifices, and that by sacrifices D. vanquished Dā., he urged
<div n="lb">him to perform the {%Rājasūya,%} the Horse-sacrifice, the {%Sarva-%}
<div n="lb">{%medha,%} and the {%Naramedha;%} [especially] the Horse-sacrifice
<div n="lb">after the example of {%Rāma Dāśarathi%} and {%Bharata Dauṣmanti,%}
[Page008-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and indicated to him a spot in the {%Himavat,%} where there
<div n="lb">was gold in abundance, left behind by the brahmans at the
<div n="lb">sacrifice of {%Marutta%} of the {%Karandhama%} race. Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} told the history of {%Marutta%} (XIV, {@3@})
<div n="lb">** i.e. Saṃvartta-Maruttīya {%(b). Vaiśampāyana%} said:
<div n="lb">† {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was delighted at hearing the speech of {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">and desirous of performing his sacrifices with those riches,
<div n="lb">he consulted with his ministers (XIV, {@4—10@}).—§ 779:
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: When {%Vyāsa%} had concluded his speech,
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} saying that {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">{%karman%} has not yet been annihilated, nor had his foes been
<div n="lb">subjugated—“How canst thou be ignorant of the enemies in
<div n="lb">thy own flesh?”—and related the history of {%Indra's%} war with
<div n="lb">Vṛtra {%(b)%} (XIV, {@11@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} then expounds that, as
<div n="lb">physical ailments and health depend on the distribution of
<div n="lb">the cold, warm, and windy [humours] of the body, so do the
<div n="lb">mental ailments and health depend on {%sattva, rajas,%} and {%tamas%}
<div n="lb">in the soul [mind]; happiness is overcome by sorrow, and
<div n="lb">sorrow by pleasure; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should not recall his past
<div n="lb">sorrows: {%Kṛṣṇā%} in the assembly, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “the time has
<div n="lb">now come when thou must fight single-handed with thy
<div n="lb">mind” (XIV, {@12@}); salvation is not attained by foregoing
<div n="lb">external things; {%Mṛtyu%} (death) is [the thought] “mine,”
<div n="lb">and the eternal {%Brāhman%} is [the thought] “not mine”; as
<div n="lb">no creature is ever destroyed, {%ahiṃsā%} (absence of injury) may
<div n="lb">exist even when one has pierced [a creature's] body, and
<div n="lb">{%vice versa;%} († v. 339—341): † the {%yogin%} knows {%yoga%} to be the
<div n="lb">perfect way, on account of the practices of his many former
<div n="lb">births; quoting the old verses sung by {%Kāma:%} “no creature
<div n="lb">is able to destroy me without [resorting to] the [proper]
<div n="lb">methods [i.e. subjugation of all desires, practice of {%yoga,%}
<div n="lb">etc.]…” (XIV, {@13@}).—§ 780: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Thus
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was consoled, exhorted by {%Viṣṭaraśravas,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); and having again performed the obsequial rites for
<div n="lb">his relatives, etc., he ruled the earth. He said to {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Nārada,%} etc., that he would now perform the sacrifice, and
<div n="lb">said that they would go to the {%Himālaya%} under the protection
<div n="lb">of {%Vyāsa%} [to fetch the gold], according to the words of
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa,%} D.-ṛ. {%Nārada,%} and {%Devasthāna.%} Then M.-ṛ. took
<div n="lb">leave of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa,%} and {%Arjuna.%} A short time
<div n="lb">passed away while they performed their purifications after
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} death, and gave large gifts to the brahmans as
<div n="lb">{%śrāddha (aurddhvadehikaṃ)%} to the {%Kurus Bhīṣma, Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">etc., accompanied by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and then they entered
<div n="lb">the city of {%Hāstinapura%} (XIV, {@14@}).—§ 781: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} what {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} did when the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">had reconquered and pacified their kingdom, {%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">said: When the {%Pāṇḍava%}-kingdom had been conquered and
<div n="lb">pacified {%K.%} and {%A.%} travelled with great pleasure amidst
<div n="lb">picturesque sceneries, like {%Indra%} and his wife (?, so PCR.)
<div n="lb">{%(deveśvarau)%} in heaven, or like the {%Aśvins%} in {%Nandana,%} and
<div n="lb">[then] entered the palace of {%Indraprastha%} in great merriment,
<div n="lb">reciting the genealogies of Ṛ. and gods, etc., and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">consoled {%Arjuna%} for the death of his relatives (<lang n="greek"></lang>). It was
<div n="lb">long since he had seen {%Vasudeva, Baladeva,%} and the {%Vṛṣṇi%}-
<div n="lb">heroes; he, therefore, asked leave to go to {%Dvāravatī,%} and to
<div n="lb">accompany him to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and apprise him of his
<div n="lb">departure. († v. 404—6): {%Arjuna%} sorrowfully replied, “Be
<div n="lb">it so” (XIV, {@15@}).
