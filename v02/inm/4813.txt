{@[Jarāsandhavadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">killing of Jarāsandha,” the 23rd of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Jarāsandhavadha). § 276: As {%Kṛṣṇa%} thought
<div n="lb">that {%Jarāsandha%} was incapable of being vanquished in battle
<div n="lb">even by all the gods and {%Asuras,%} but might be vanquished in
<div n="lb">a personal struggle with bare arms ({%prāṇayuddha,%} PCR.), and
<div n="lb">as there was in himself policy, in {%Bhīma%} strength, and in
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} ability to protect them, he thought that {%Jarāsandha%}
<div n="lb">should be made to challenge {%Bhīma,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} therefore
<div n="lb">obtained the permission of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that {%Bhīma%} and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} followed him. They set out in the garb of {%snātakas,%}
<div n="lb">with {%Bhīma%} in the van, from the land of the {%Kurus%} to the
<div n="lb">{%Padmasaras,%} over {%Kālakūṭa, Gaṇḍakī, Mahāśoṇa, Sadānīrā%}
<div n="lb">(v. 794 runs thus in V.: {%Gaṇḍakīñca Sadānīrāṃ Śarkarā-%}
<div n="lb">{%varttam eva ca%}), the rivers on the {%Ekaparvataka%} (? see
<div n="lb">BR.) and {%Pūrvā%} (i.e. Eastern) {%Kośalā%} (B. has {%pūrvāṃś ca%}
<div n="lb">{%Kośalān%}), {%Mithilā, Mālā, Carmaṇvatī, Gaṅgā, Śoṇa,%} towards
<div n="lb">the east, dressed in garments of {%kuśa%}-grass (instead of
<div n="lb">{%kuśacīracchadā%} V. has {%Kuśāmboraḥsthalaṃ%}), to the {%Māgadha%}
<div n="lb">land. When they came to the mountain of {%Goratha,%} they
<div n="lb">beheld the {%Māgadha%} town (II, {@20@}).—§ 277: {%Girivraja%} is
[Page355-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">surrounded by the five large hills of {%Vaihāra, Varāha,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣabha, Ṛṣigiri,%} and {%Caityaka.%} It was there that {%Gautama%}
<div n="lb">begat {%Kākṣīvat,%} etc., upon the {%śūdra%} woman {%Auśīnarī,%} and
<div n="lb">was visited by the kings of {%Aṅga, Vaṅga,%} etc. There dwell
<div n="lb">the {%Nāgas Arbuda, Śakravāpin, Svastika,%} and {%Maṇināga.%}
<div n="lb">{%Manu%} had ordered the {%Māgadhas%} never to be afflicted with
<div n="lb">drought; {%Kauśika%} and {%Maṇimat%} had favoured the country.
<div n="lb">The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} entered the city by breaking down
<div n="lb">the peak of {%Caityaka,%} worshipped by the {%Bārhadrathas%} and
<div n="lb">the citizens with perfumes and flower garlands, where
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhadratha%} had slain the cannibal {%Ṛṣabha,%} and made of
<div n="lb">his hide ({%māsatālābhiḥ,%} see BR.; Gauḍapāṭha: {%māṃsanālābhiḥ,%}
<div n="lb">Nīl.) three drums [which the brothers broke, v. 814, not
<div n="lb">in V.]. As evil omens had been seen, the {%purohitas%} made
<div n="lb">{%Jarāsandha%} mount an elephant and carried fire about him
<div n="lb">{%(paryagnyakurvan),%} and he entered upon {%(dīkṣitaḥ)%} a sacrifice
<div n="lb">with vows {%(niyamasthaḥ)%} and fasts {%(upavāsaparaḥ). Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma,%} and {%Dhanañjaya%} entered the city without weapons
<div n="lb">in the guise of {%snātakas,%} snatched from the flower-vendors
<div n="lb">the garlands they had exposed for sale, and attired in robes
<div n="lb">of various colours and decked with garlands and ear-rings they
<div n="lb">entered the abode of {%Jarāsandha,%} who welcomed them, and
<div n="lb">hearing from {%Kṛṣṇa%} that {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} in consequence
<div n="lb">of a vow would not speak before night, quartered them in the
<div n="lb">sacrificial apartments {%(yajñāgāre)%} and retired to the palace
<div n="lb">{%(rājagṛhaṃ).%} At midnight he came to them, as he always
<div n="lb">observed the vow, that as soon as he should hear of the
<div n="lb">arrival of {%snātakas,%} even at midnight, he would immediately
<div n="lb">come out and grant them an audience. As he questioned
<div n="lb">them about their strange attire, which was unsuitable
<div n="lb">for {%snātakas,%} and their breaking down the {%Caityaka%} peak,
<div n="lb">and why they would not accept the worship he offered,
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} gave him some explanations (v. 848 ff.: {%snātaka-%}
<div n="lb">{%vratino, rājan ! brāhmaṇā, kṣatriyā, viśaḥ|viśeṣaniyamāś%}
<div n="lb">{%caiṣām aviśeṣāś ca santy uta | viśeṣavāṃś ca satataṃ kṣat-%}
<div n="lb">{%triyaḥ śriyam ṛcchati%}), and declared that they had come as his
<div n="lb">foes (II, {@21@}). As {%Jarāsandha%} said that he did not remember
<div n="lb">to have injured them, {%Kṛṣṇa%} told him that they were
<div n="lb">sent by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to set at liberty the princes whom
<div n="lb">{%Jarāsandha%} intended to slaughter as a sacrifice to {%Śiva,%} because
<div n="lb">sacrificing human beings to the gods was never used (v. 864);
<div n="lb">he reminded him of the destruction of {%Dambhodbhava, Kārta-%}
<div n="lb">{%vīrya, Uttara,%} and {%Bṛhadratha,%} and challenged him to set
<div n="lb">free the monarchs or to fight. {%Jarāsandha%} chose to fight, and
<div n="lb">ordered {%Sahadeva,%} to be installed on the throne. Then he
<div n="lb">thought of his generals {%Kauśika%} and {%Citrasena,%} who had
<div n="lb">formerly been {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka. Kṛṣṇa,%} remembering
<div n="lb">that, according to the command of {%Brahmán, Jarāsandha%} was
<div n="lb">not to be slain by him or by the {%Madhus,%} did not himself desire
<div n="lb">to slay him (II, {@22@}). {%Jarāsandha%} having chosen to fight with
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma,%} the {%purohita%} brought pigment, garlands, etc., and
<div n="lb">propitiatory ceremonies {%(kṛtasvastyayanaḥ)%} were performed by
<div n="lb">a brahman; and likewise {%Bhīma,%} having consulted with {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">had propitiatory ceremonies pronounced {%(kṛtasvastyayanaḥ).%}
<div n="lb">When {%Jarāsandha%} had taken off his crown and arranged
<div n="lb">his hair, they fought with their clenched fists as their only
<div n="lb">weapons. The combat began at the first day of the month
<div n="lb">{%Kārttika,%} and lasted, without intermission or food, till the
<div n="lb">thirteenth; on the fourteenth night {%Jarāsandha%} desisted from
<div n="lb">fatigue, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} obscurely intimated that he should now
<div n="lb">be killed (II, {@23@}). At the instigation of {%Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">threw {%Jarāsandha%} into the air a hundred times, pressed his
<div n="lb">knee against his backbone and broke his body in two with
[Page355-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">a terrible roar, so that the citizens became dumb with terror
<div n="lb">and many women were prematurely delivered. Leaving the
<div n="lb">lifeless body at the palace gate, they went out of the town
<div n="lb">riding on {%Jarāsandha's%} celestial chariot, which {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused
<div n="lb">to be made ready, it being adorned with a celestial flagstaff
<div n="lb">and incapable of being vanquished by any king, upon which
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} and {%Viṣṇu%} had fought in the battle about {%Tārakā,%}
<div n="lb">riding upon which {%Indra%} had slain ninety-nine {%(navatīr nava)%}
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas,%} which had been obtained by king {%Vasu%} from {%Vāsava%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Indra), from {%Vasu%} by {%Bṛhadratha,%} and from him by
<div n="lb">{%Jarāsandha.%} And {%Kṛṣṇa%} thought of {%Garuḍa,%} who sat upon
<div n="lb">the chariot along with the frightfully roaring creatures on its
<div n="lb">flagstaff. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then released his relatives and ordered
<div n="lb">them to assist {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at his {%rājasūya.%} Stopping on
<div n="lb">a level plain outside the town, he was adored by the citizens,
<div n="lb">and he installed {%Sahadeva,%} the son of {%Jarāsandha,%} in the
<div n="lb">sovereignty of the {%Magadhas.%} Then they arrived at {%Indra-%}
<div n="lb">{%prastha.%} Thereupon {%Kṛṣṇa,%} having taken leave of {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira,%} etc., set out for his own city, riding upon that same
<div n="lb">celestial chariot that had been given to him by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} having circumambulated him {%(pradakṣiṇam%}
<div n="lb">{%akurvanta)%} (II, {@24@})
