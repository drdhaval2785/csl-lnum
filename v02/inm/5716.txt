[{@Khaḍgotpattikathana(ṃ)@}]¦ (the narrative of the origin
<div n="lb">of the sword). § 656 (cf. Āpaddh.): Nakula {%(b)%} questioned
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma as to which (the sword or the bow) is really the
[Page405-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">foremost of weapons, and how the sword was first created
<div n="lb">and for what purpose, and who was the first instructor
<div n="lb">in the use of that weapon. Bhīṣma related that in
<div n="lb">ancient times the universe was one vast expanse of water,
<div n="lb">enveloped in darkness, etc. There {%Pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%})
<div n="lb">took his birth, he then created wind, fire, etc., and then
<div n="lb">assuming a visible form he begot {%Marīci,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) [and
<div n="lb">{%Pracetas;%} the last begot] {%Dakṣa (c).%} When {%Sarvaloka-%}
<div n="lb">{%pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}) had called into existence all
<div n="lb">creatures he promulgated the eternal religion laid down
<div n="lb">in the {%Vedas.%} That religion was accepted by the gods
<div n="lb">with their preceptors and priests, and by Ā., V., R., S.,
<div n="lb">M., A., {%Bhṛgu, Atri, Aṅgiras,%} Si., the {%Kāśyapas, Vasiṣṭha,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); all of them lived in obedience to {%Brahmán.%} But
<div n="lb">the foremost of the {%Dānavas, Hiraṇyakaśipu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and
<div n="lb">many other {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas,%} filled with wrath and
<div n="lb">covetousness, took delight in all kinds of wicked acts, etc.,
<div n="lb">wielding only the rod of chastisement; those foremost of
<div n="lb">{%Asuras%} forsook every kindly intercourse with other creatures.
<div n="lb">Then {%Brahmán%} with the {%Brahmarṣis%} proceeded to a delightful
<div n="lb">summit of {%Himavat,%} and after 1,000 years he arranged a sacrifice.
<div n="lb">From the sacrificial fire arose {%Asi%} (“the sword”) {%(d),%} which
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} gave to {%Rudra%} (i.e. {%Śiva%}) in order to enable him to
<div n="lb">put down irreligion. {%Rudra%} (description) with the sword
<div n="lb">destroyed and dispersed the {%Asuras (Dānavas);%} some of them
<div n="lb">penetrated into the bowels of the earth, others got under the
<div n="lb">cover of the mountains, some went upwards, others entered
<div n="lb">the depths of the sea. {%Rudra%} then gave the sword to {%Viṣṇu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu%} to {%Marīci, Marīci%} to the {%maharṣis,%} the {%maharṣis%} to
<div n="lb">{%Vāsava%} (i.e. {%Indra%}), {%Mahendra%} (i.e. {%Indra%}) to the {%lokapālas,%}
<div n="lb">the {%lokapālas%} to {%Manu (e)%} the son of {%Sūrya.%} He gave it to
<div n="lb">his son {%Kṣupa.%} Thence it passed successively to {%Ikṣvāku,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), from {%Droṇa%} to {%Kṛpa,%} from {%Kṛpa%} to thee {%(Nakula)%}
<div n="lb">and thy brothers. {%Kṛttikāḥ%} is the {%nakṣatra%} of the sword,
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} its deity, {%Rohiṇī%} its {%gotra, Rudra%} its high preceptor.
<div n="lb">Its eight mysterious names are {%Asi,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Of all weapons
<div n="lb">the sword is the foremost; the {%Purāṇas%} truly declare that it
<div n="lb">was first wielded by {%Maheśvara%} (i.e. {%Śiva%}). {%Pṛthu (Vainya)%}
<div n="lb">{%(f)%} created the first bow. Persons skilled in weapons should
<div n="lb">always worship the sword. Blessing to the reader (XII, {@166@}).
