<div n="lb">Śrāddha,” the 87th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr. § 10
<div n="lb">(Parvas.): I, {@2,@} 349.—§ 620: {%Kṛṣṇa%} censured {%Gāndhārī,%}
<div n="lb">saying that this vast carnage had taken place by her fault,
<div n="lb">through her son {%Duryodhana;%} and told her not to grieve
<div n="lb">(“the cow brings forth offspring to bear burthens…
<div n="lb">the {%Śūdrā%} woman to increase the number of servitors…
<div n="lb">a princess, like thee, brings forth sons to be slaughtered”).
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} remained silent. Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that one billion 660,020,000 men had
<div n="lb">fallen; and 24,165 had escaped; the fallen had all attained to
<div n="lb">regions like those of {%Indra%} (specifying those who had attained
<div n="lb">to G., Gh., {%Brahmaloka,%} and {%Uttarakurus%}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">said that in the forest he had obtained the gift of
<div n="lb">spiritual vision from D.-ṛ. {%Lomaśa.%} Urged by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ordered {%Sudharman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), to cause the funeral
<div n="lb">rites of the slain (<lang n="greek"></lang>) to be duly performed; they burned
<div n="lb">them upon funeral pyres; the {%Pitṛmedha%}-rites were performed
<div n="lb">for some of the illustrious dead; by the noise of {%sāmans,%}
<div n="lb">{%ṛcs,%} and lamentations all creatures became stupefied that
<div n="lb">night. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} proceeded towards
<div n="lb">the {%Gaṅgā%} (XI, {@26@}). The {%Kuru%} ladies, etc., performed the
<div n="lb">water-rites for their fellow-kinsmen at the {%Gaṅgā. Kuntī,%} in
<div n="lb">a paroxysm of grief, disclosed the truth about {%Karṇa's%} birth
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) to her sons. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} grieved, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">lamented, hearing that {%Karṇa%} was his elder brother (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused {%Karṇa's%} wives, etc., to be brought
<div n="lb">before him, and with them performed the water-rite in
<div n="lb">honour of {%Karṇa%} (XI, {@27@}).
