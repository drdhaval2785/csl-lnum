{@Mārjāra-mūṣika-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“the discourse
<div n="lb">between a cat and a mouse”). § 646{%b%} (Āpaddh.): There
<div n="lb">was a large banyan in the midst of a forest, with various
<div n="lb">kinds of birds, etc. A wise mouse, {%Palita,%} lived at the foot
<div n="lb">of that tree, having made a hole there with 100 outlets.
<div n="lb">On the branches lived a cat {%Lomaśa.%} A {%Cāṇḍāla%} came and
<div n="lb">built a hut, setting his traps of leather strings every evening
<div n="lb">after sunset. One day he caught the cat. {%Palita%} began to
<div n="lb">eat the flesh in the trap, but beheld the mongoose {%Harito%}
<div n="lb">and the owl {%Candraka.%} He resolved upon saving the cat
<div n="lb">though an enemy, in order to escape from them; having
<div n="lb">made peace with the cat, he crouched beneath it; the
<div n="lb">mongoose and owl left the spot; the mouse began to cut
<div n="lb">the strings slowly, notwithstanding the cat's impatience.
<div n="lb">At morning the {%Cāṇḍāla Parigha%} appeared (description),
<div n="lb">accompanied by a pack of dogs. Then the mouse quickly cut
<div n="lb">the remaining string; the cat got upon the banyan, {%Palita%}
<div n="lb">entered his hole. The hunter took up his net and left the
<div n="lb">spot. {%Palita%} would not conclude friendship with the cat,
<div n="lb">and entered another hole.
