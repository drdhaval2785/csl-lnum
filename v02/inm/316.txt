[{@Aiṣīkaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the Aiṣīka
<div n="lb">weapon”), the 84th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr., cf.
<div n="lb">Aiṣīka. § 617: The driver of Dhṛṣṭadyumna's chariot,
<div n="lb">who had managed to escape from Kṛtavarman at a
<div n="lb">time when he was heedless, informs Yudhiṣṭhira, in the
<div n="lb">morning, of the extermination of his army. Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">falls down on the earth; Sātyaki holds him in his
<div n="lb">embrace; Bhīma, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), stretch forth their arms. Having
<div n="lb">recovered his senses Yudhiṣṭhira laments (<lang n="greek"></lang>,) and
<div n="lb">despatches Nakula to bring thither Draupadī and the
<div n="lb">ladies with her; then he proceeds to view the slaughter in
<div n="lb">his camp, and falls down on the earth with all his followers
<div n="lb">(X, {@10@}). Draupadī arrives from Upaplavya, falls
<div n="lb">down in the presence of Yudhiṣṭhira, is comforted by
<div n="lb">Bhīma, addresses Yudhiṣṭhira (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and resolves to sit
<div n="lb">in Prāya, if the Pāṇḍavas do not slay Aśvatthāman.
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira urged her to forget her sorrows, as Aśvatthā-
<div n="lb">man is not to be found. Draupadī insists on Aśvatthāman's
<div n="lb">slaughter and the depredation of the gem on his head,
<div n="lb">appealing in particular to Bhīmasena (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Bhīmasena,
<div n="lb">making Nakula his charioteer, sets out in pursuit of
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman, guided by the track of the latter's car-wheels
<div n="lb">(X, {@11@}). Kṛṣṇa urges Yudhiṣṭhira to make arrangements
<div n="lb">for the safety of Bhīma, as Aśvatthāman has the Brahma-
<div n="lb">śiras {%(b)%} weapon capable of exterminating all foes (X, {@12@}).
<div n="lb">The Pāṇḍavas, with Kṛṣṇa, proceed on the track of Bhīma-
<div n="lb">sena: Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna, and Yudhiṣṭhira on Kṛṣṇa's car
[Page026-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">with steeds of the Kāmboja breed: Śaibya on the right,
<div n="lb">Sugrīva on the left, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka being
<div n="lb">pārṣṇivāhas, the standard having been made by Viśva-
<div n="lb">karman and standing high like Māyā, with Garuḍa. They
<div n="lb">in vain ask Bhīma to stop. They find Aśvatthāman sitting
<div n="lb">with Vyāsa on the bank of {%Gaṅgā%} in the midst of many Ṛ.;
<div n="lb">he is attired in a piece of cloth made of Kuśa-grass, etc…
<div n="lb">He consecrates a blade of grass with Mantras, and converts it
<div n="lb">into that powerful celestial weapon, and throws it off with the
<div n="lb">words “for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas” (X, {@13@}).
<div n="lb">Urged by Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna shoots the [Brāhma, PCR.]
<div n="lb">weapon imparted to him by Droṇa, which was capable of
<div n="lb">neutralizing all weapons. Extraordinary portents appear in
<div n="lb">nature. Nārada and Vyāsa, trying to save the three
<div n="lb">worlds, stand between the two fires (X, {@14@}). Arjuna
<div n="lb">withdraws his weapon; but Aśvatthāman is incapable of
<div n="lb">withdrawing his, as no person of uncleansed soul can bring
<div n="lb">it back, after it has once been let off, but only a brahmacārin
<div n="lb">(and such a one is Arjuna); otherwise it strikes off his own
<div n="lb">head. Vyāsa praises Arjuna for not having before used
<div n="lb">the Brahmaśiras weapon; “that region where Brahmaśiras
<div n="lb">is baffled by another high weapon, suffers a drought for
<div n="lb">twelve years”; he proposes to him to give the Pāṇḍavas the
<div n="lb">gem on his head; then the Pāṇḍavas would in return grant
<div n="lb">him his life. Aśvatthāman surrenders his gem, whose wearer
<div n="lb">ceases to have any fear from weapons, etc., and from D., Dā.,
<div n="lb">and N., and Rā.; the weapon he throws into the wombs of
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍava women (X, {@15@}). Kṛṣṇa says that a brahman
<div n="lb">at Upaplavya has said to Uttarā, “while the Kuru line will
<div n="lb">become extinct, a son will be born to thee, and he will for
<div n="lb">that reason be called Parikṣit.” Aśvatthāman says that
<div n="lb">his words could not but be fulfilled. Kṛṣṇa says that
<div n="lb">the fœtus will die, but be recalled to a long life; but
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman shall wander for 3000 years alone, and without
<div n="lb">being able to talk to anyone; the stench of pus and blood
<div n="lb">shall emanate from him, and inaccessible forests and dreary
<div n="lb">moors shall be his abode; he shall wander over the earth with
<div n="lb">the weight of all diseases on him. Parikṣit shall learn the
<div n="lb">use of all weapons from Kṛpa and rule the earth for sixty
<div n="lb">years; Kṛṣṇa will revive him. Vyāsa approves of Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb">curse. Aśvatthāman proceeds to the forest. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">with Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsa, and Nārada, taking with them the gem,
<div n="lb">come to Draupadī, who is sitting in Prāya. Bhīma comforts
<div n="lb">Draupadī (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Draupadī asks Yudhiṣṭhira to place upon his
<div n="lb">head the gem taken from Aśvatthāman. Yudhiṣṭhira asks
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa (X, {@16@}) about the true cause of Aśvatthāman's success
<div n="lb">in destroying the Pāṇḍava army (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Kṛṣṇa ascribes it to
<div n="lb">the aid of Mahādeva, and relates that when Brahmán,
<div n="lb">desirous of creating, saw Rudra, he asked him to create
<div n="lb">living creatures; Rudra promised to do so, and plunged into
<div n="lb">the waters and practised austerities. Then Brahmán called
<div n="lb">into existence another being in order to make him the creator
<div n="lb">of living creatures, and he created Dakṣa, etc.; but they
<div n="lb">ran towards their creator from hunger, desirous of devouring
<div n="lb">him, and he repaired to Brahmán, who assigned herbs, etc.,
<div n="lb">as their food, and the weak beings to the strong ones. The
<div n="lb">creatures multiplied. Then Rudra rose from the water,
<div n="lb">became angry, and caused his productive limb to disappear
<div n="lb">in the earth. He had created food (herbs and plants) for
<div n="lb">all these creatures. Then he went away, in cheerlessness
<div n="lb">and rage, to the Muñjavat mountains in order to practise
<div n="lb">severer austerities (X, {@17@}). After the Kṛta-age the gods
<div n="lb">prepared a sacrifice, but not knowing Rudra truly they
[Page027-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">assigned no share to him. Rudra constructed a bow of two
<div n="lb">of the four kinds of sacrifices (v. the note of PCR., p. 58),
<div n="lb">and came as a brahmacārin to the sacrifice; the earth
<div n="lb">shrank with fear, etc.; Rudra pierced the sacrifice in the
<div n="lb">heart; it assumed the shape of a deer and fled away with
<div n="lb">Agni, pursued by Rudra through the skies; the gods were
<div n="lb">stupefied; Rudra with his bow broke the arms of Savitṛ and
<div n="lb">plucked out the eyes of Bhaga and the teeth of Pūṣan;
<div n="lb">the gods uttered a cry; the string of his bow burst; the gods
<div n="lb">and the sacrifice gratified Rudra; he threw his wrath into
<div n="lb">the water; that wrath, assuming the form of fire, is always
<div n="lb">employed in consuming the water. He then gave unto
<div n="lb">Savitṛ his arms, to Bhaga his eyes, and to Pūṣan his teeth,
<div n="lb">and restored the sacrifice. The gods assigned to him all
<div n="lb">the libations of clarified butter as his share (X, {@18@}).
