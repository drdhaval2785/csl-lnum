[{@Indradyumnopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“history of Indra-
<div n="lb">dyumna”). § 468 (Mārk.): The {%Pāṇḍavas%} asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}
<div n="lb">“Is there anybody that is older than thou?” He related:
<div n="lb">“The {%rājarṣi Indradyumna,%} who had fallen from heaven,
<div n="lb">complained that his fame must have passed away, and asked
<div n="lb">me if I recognized him; as I did not, he became a horse
[Page341-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and carried me to the {%Himavat%} to the owl {%Prāvārakarṇa,%} who
<div n="lb">was older than I; the owl we took to the lake {%Indradyumna%}
<div n="lb">to the crane {%Nāḍījaṅgha,%} who was older than the owl; the
<div n="lb">crane indicated us the tortoise {%Akūpāra%} in the same lake.
<div n="lb">{%Akūpāra%} knew {%Indradyumna,%} and said that {%Indradyumna%} had
<div n="lb">planted the {%yūpa%} 1,000 times, and that this lake had been
<div n="lb">excavated by the feet of the cows given away by him to the
<div n="lb">brahmans. Then a chariot came from heaven, and a celestial
<div n="lb">voice called {%Indradyumna%} back to heaven (vv. 13343—5, three
<div n="lb">{%ślokas%} are cited; v. 13343: ‘The report of a virtuous deed
<div n="lb">reaches heaven and earth; as long as that report is heard, so
<div n="lb">long is the doer said to be in heaven’). He first brought
<div n="lb">me and the owl to our respective places, and then went away
<div n="lb">in that chariot.” The {%Pāṇḍavas%} praised {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} for
<div n="lb">having caused {%Indradyumna%} to regain his sphere; he said that
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} also had raised the {%rājarṣi Nṛga%} from hell and caused
<div n="lb">him to regain heaven (III, {@199@}).
