[{@Ambopākhyānaparvan@}]¦ (“the section containing the
<div n="lb">episode of Ambā,” the 66th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
<div n="lb">Cf. Ambopākhyāna). § 573. Questioned by Duryodhana
<div n="lb">why he would not slay Śikhaṇḍin, Bhīṣma said: After
<div n="lb">Śāntanu's death and Citrāṅgada's demise, obedient to the
<div n="lb">counsels of Satyavatī I installed, according to the ordinance,
<div n="lb">Vicitravīrya as king. I repaired on a single car to the
<div n="lb">{%svayaṃvara%} of the daughters of the king of Kāśi: Ambā
<div n="lb">(the eldest), Ambikā (the second), and Ambālikā (the
<div n="lb">youngest), who were {%vīryaśalkāḥ.%} Challenging all the
<div n="lb">kings, I took the three maidens upon my car, and repeatedly
<div n="lb">told my name to the kings, and vanquished them all. Then
<div n="lb">I came back to Hāstinapura and made over those maidens,
<div n="lb">intending them for Vicitravīrya, to Satyavatī (V, {@173@}).
<div n="lb">Satyavatī became very glad. When the nuptials approached,
<div n="lb">Ambā said that she had before mentally chosen the Śālva king
<div n="lb">(the lord of Saubha, v. 6076, etc.) as her lord, and that he,
<div n="lb">without her father's knowledge, had privately proposed to
<div n="lb">her (V, {@174@}). I then laid the matter before Satyavatī and
<div n="lb">our counsellors {%(mantrin), ṛtvijes,%} and {%purohitas,%} and permitted
<div n="lb">Ambā to depart. She came to the city of the Śālva king,
<div n="lb">escorted by a number of old brahmans, accompanied by
<div n="lb">her nurse. But he would no longer have her as his wife,
<div n="lb">because she was to be wedded to another. It was of no avail
<div n="lb">that she declared she had been carried away by force, weeping
<div n="lb">and against her will; for Śālva was in terror of Bhīṣma.
<div n="lb">She cursed Bhīṣma, her father, herself (because she had not
[Page031-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">leapt down from Bhīṣma's car), Śālva, and Dhātṛ (the
<div n="lb">creator). She resolved that her vengeance should fall upon
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma. She repaired to a hermitage of ascetics {%(tāpasāḥ),%}
<div n="lb">and stayed there that night. There was the great brahman
<div n="lb">Śaikhāvatya, a preceptor in the scriptures and the Āraṇyakas
<div n="lb">{%(śāstre cāraṇyake guruh)%} (V, {@175@}). The ascetics counselled
<div n="lb">her to repair to her father's abode; but she would not, lest
<div n="lb">she should be slighted by her relatives; she wished to practise
<div n="lb">ascetic austerities. Then came her maternal grandfather, the
<div n="lb">Sṛñjaya king, the R.-ṛ. Hotravāhana, and advised her to go to
<div n="lb">Rāma Jāmadagnya, who would slay Bhīṣma in battle if
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma did not obey his behest; he always dwelt on the
<div n="lb">Mahendra mountain with Ṛ., G., and Aps. While they were
<div n="lb">speaking there appeared Akṛtavraṇa, a dear companion of
<div n="lb">Rāma; he said that Rāma would come the next morning
<div n="lb">to see Hotravāhana; Hotravāhana related the history of
<div n="lb">Ambā to Akṛtavraṇa (V, {@176@}). The next day Rāma
<div n="lb">appeared with his disciples, his bow in hand, etc. (de-
<div n="lb">scription). Ambā asked him to slay Bhīṣma (V, {@177@}).
<div n="lb">Rāma said he would not take up arms except at the command
<div n="lb">of brahmans. Akṛtavraṇa supported the demand of Ambā.
<div n="lb">The next morning they all set out for Kurukṣetra with the
<div n="lb">maiden, and quartered themselves on the banks of Sarasvatī.
<div n="lb">On the third day Rāma sent a message to Bhīṣma, who came
<div n="lb">and worshipped him. Rāma demanded that he should bestow
<div n="lb">Ambā upon Vicitravīrya, which Bhīṣma refused. Rāma
<div n="lb">threatened to slay him in battle; Bhīṣma said that Rāma
<div n="lb">had himself taught him the four kinds of arms ({%iṣvastraṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%caturvidhaṃ;%} see the note of PCR.); and quoted a {%śloka%} in the
<div n="lb">Purāṇa, sung by Marutta (v. 7074). Having first gone to
<div n="lb">Hāstinapura and represented everything to Satyavatī, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">set out for Kurukṣetra on his car (description). Gaṅgā
<div n="lb">(“worshipped by Si. and Cā,” v. 7095) in vain endeavoured
<div n="lb">to make them desist (V, {@178@}). Bhīṣma asked Rāma to mount
<div n="lb">on a chariot; but Rāma said that the earth was his chariot,
<div n="lb">the Vedas his steeds, the wind (Mātariśvan) his charioteer,
<div n="lb">and the mothers of the Vedas (Vedamātaraḥ; see the note of
<div n="lb">PCR.) his harness. Bhīṣma saw him stationed on an
<div n="lb">excellent car (description), with Akṛtavraṇa as his charioteer.
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma propitiated Rāma by worshipping him, on foot. The
<div n="lb">combat lasted for many days; at last Bhīṣma, from pity and
<div n="lb">reverence, would not strike Rāma any longer, and the combat
<div n="lb">ceased at sunset (V, {@179@}). Next morning the battle was
<div n="lb">taken up again. Bhīṣma's Vāyavya weapon was neutralized
<div n="lb">by Rāma's Guhyaka; Bhīṣma's Āgneya by Rāma's Vāruṇa.
<div n="lb">At a momentary swoon of Bhīṣma, Akṛtavraṇa, Ambā, etc.,
<div n="lb">were filled with joy; then Rāma fell into a swoon and
<div n="lb">dropped down; the ascetics and Ambā comforted him.
<div n="lb">A conflagration was caused in the welkin. At evening
<div n="lb">Rāma withdrew (V, {@180@}). The next day they fought
<div n="lb">again, and at evening they desisted (V, {@181@}). The next
<div n="lb">day Bhīṣma's charioteer was slain; Bhīṣma, pierced by an
<div n="lb">arrow, fell down to the earth; eight brahmans supported him
<div n="lb">on their arms in mid-air; Gaṅgā was seen on his car; she
<div n="lb">had controlled his steeds in the combat. Bhīṣma dismissed
<div n="lb">her and fought till evening. When Rāma for a moment lost
<div n="lb">his consciousness, Rāhu enveloped the sun, etc. At evening
<div n="lb">the battle ceased; next day it was taken up again, and lasted
<div n="lb">for twenty-three days (V, {@182@}). During the night the
<div n="lb">above-mentioned eight brahmans appeared to Bhīṣma in
<div n="lb">a dream, comforted him, and said that the weapon Prasvāpa
<div n="lb">({%Prājāpatyaṃ Viśvakṛtam,%} v. 7259; PCR., “appertaining to
<div n="lb">the lord of all creatures and forged by the divine artificer”)
[Page032-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">would come to his knowledge, for it had been known to him
<div n="lb">in his former life; neither Rāma nor any person on earth
<div n="lb">was acquainted with it; Rāma would not be slain by it, but
<div n="lb">he would fall asleep; “then thou wilt awaken him with
<div n="lb">the weapon Sambodhana” (V, {@183@}). Next day Akṛtavraṇa
<div n="lb">must comfort Rāma. Bhīṣma and Rāma both used the
<div n="lb">Brāhma weapon; the welkin seemed to be ablaze, and
<div n="lb">D., As., Ṛ., G., and Rā. were greatly afflicted, etc. Then
<div n="lb">the {%mantras%} for using the Prasvāpa weapon suddenly came
<div n="lb">to Bhīṣma's mind (V, {@184@}). Voices in the sky (the gods)
<div n="lb">and Nārada forbade him to let off the Prasvāpa weapon against
<div n="lb">Rāma, and the above-mentioned brahmans supported the words
<div n="lb">of Nārada. Beholding the Prasvāpa weapon withdrawn,
<div n="lb">Rāma declared himself to be vanquished. Rāma then beheld
<div n="lb">before him his father and father's father, who forbade him
<div n="lb">any more to fight with kṣattriyas, especially with Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb">whom the gods forbade to fight with Rāma. “Arjuna has
<div n="lb">been ordained by Svayambhū to be the slayer of Bhīṣma.”
<div n="lb">The ascetics with Ṛcīka, Nārada, Gaṅgā, and the Pitṛs
<div n="lb">succeeded in bringing about peace; the above-mentioned
<div n="lb">eight brahmans ordered. Bhīṣma to go to Rāma, who,
<div n="lb">summoning Ambā, said (V, {@185@}) that he could do no more
<div n="lb">for her. Ambā went away, resolved to devote herself to
<div n="lb">austerities, that she might herself slay Bhīṣma. Rāma with
<div n="lb">the ascetics departed for the Mahendra mountain; Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">entered Hāstinapura, and was blessed by Satyavatī, and he
<div n="lb">appointed spies to ascertain the doings of Ambā. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">became afflicted when he heard that she was resolved on
<div n="lb">ascetic austerities (description), but was consoled by Nārada
<div n="lb">and Vyāsa. After having lived for six months on air she
<div n="lb">stood a year in the waters of Yamunā, etc., and thus went on
<div n="lb">for twelve years. She then went into Vatsabhūmi (resorted
<div n="lb">to by Si. and Cā.), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Gaṅgā, angry because she observed
<div n="lb">these vows for the destruction of Bhīṣma, cursed her, saying
<div n="lb">that after death she would become a river crooked in her
<div n="lb">course, etc. When Ambā once more came back to Vatsabhūmi
<div n="lb">she there became the above-mentioned river, but in con-
<div n="lb">sequence of her ascetic merit, only with half her body, while
<div n="lb">as to the other half she remained a maiden as before (V, {@186@}).
<div n="lb">To the ascetics in Vatsabhūmi she said that she was resolved
<div n="lb">to obtain manhood in order to be revenged on Bhīṣma. Śiva
<div n="lb">appeared in his own form in the midst of those great ṛṣis,
<div n="lb">and promised her that she would slay Bhīṣma and even
<div n="lb">obtain manhood, and in a new body remember all the incidents;
<div n="lb">born in the race of Drupada, she would become a {%mahāratha.%}
<div n="lb">Then Śiva disappeared. Ambā burnt herself on the bank of
<div n="lb">the Yamunā in the very sight of those great Ṛṣis (V, {@187@}).
<div n="lb">Questioned by Duryodhana how Śikhaṇḍin, having before
<div n="lb">been born a girl, afterwards became a man, Bhīṣma related:
<div n="lb">The eldest queen of king Drupada was childless. During
<div n="lb">those years Drupada worshipped Śaṅkara for the sake of
<div n="lb">offspring, resolving to bring about Bhīṣma's destruction, and
<div n="lb">practising the austerest of penances. He begged Śiva for
<div n="lb">a son; Śiva said he should have a child who would be both
<div n="lb">female and male. In due time the queen conceived (as
<div n="lb">told by Nārada), and gave birth to a daughter, whom Drupada
<div n="lb">gave out for a son, and called her Śikhaṇḍin. Bhīṣma alone,
<div n="lb">from his spies and from Nārada, knew the truth (V, {@188@}).
<div n="lb">In arrows and weapons she became a disciple of Droṇa.
<div n="lb">They afterwards wedded her to the daughter of the Daśārṇa
<div n="lb">king Hiraṇyavarman, quite assured that the words of Śiva
<div n="lb">would become true. Śikhaṇḍin, after marriage, came back to
<div n="lb">Kāmpilya. At the discovery of Śikhaṇḍin's sex a war was
[Page032-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">about to break out with Hiraṇyavarman (V, {@189@}). Drupada
<div n="lb">was not naturally courageous, and became filled with fear,
<div n="lb">and, in the presence of others, asked his queen about the
<div n="lb">truth (though he knew everything) (V, {@190@}). The queen
<div n="lb">said that, childless as she was, when her daughter
<div n="lb">Śikhaṇḍinī was born she had, from fear of her co-wives,
<div n="lb">told Drupada that it was a son, remembering the words of
<div n="lb">Śiva. Drupada prepared for war, and, with the queen,
<div n="lb">prayed to the gods. Śikhaṇḍinī went to a forest, the haunt
<div n="lb">of the powerful Yakṣa (Guhyaka, v. 7480) Sthūṇākarṇa,
<div n="lb">who was a follower of Kubera, resolved on putting an end to
<div n="lb">her own life. Repeatedly requested by Sthūṇākarṇa to ask
<div n="lb">a boon, she told him the matter, and wished to become a man,
<div n="lb">as long as Hiraṇyavarman had not left the city (V, {@191@}).
<div n="lb">He gave her his manhood and took her womanhood for a
<div n="lb">certain period, i.e. till Hiraṇyavarman should have departed.
<div n="lb">Śikhaṇḍin went home and informed Drupada, who with his
<div n="lb">wife recollected the words of Śiva. Hiraṇyavarman sent
<div n="lb">a brahman as an envoy to Kāmpilya, threatening to ex-
<div n="lb">terminate Drupada with his counsellors, sons, etc. Drupada
<div n="lb">sent a brahman as his envoy to Hiraṇyavarman, maintaining
<div n="lb">that Śikhaṇḍin was a male; “let it be made clear by means
<div n="lb">of witnesses; somebody has spoken falsely to thee.” Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb">varman despatched a number of young ladies for ascertaining
<div n="lb">it, and they attested that he was a male. Hiraṇyavarman
<div n="lb">then passed some days with Drupada in gladness, gave much
<div n="lb">wealth to Śikhaṇḍin, and then departed, having rebuked
<div n="lb">his daughter. Kubera, hearing the matter from the Yakṣas,
<div n="lb">cursed Sthūṇākarṇa, saying that his femininity should remain
<div n="lb">as it was; as the Yakṣas began to soften him, he set a limit
<div n="lb">to the curse, i.e. Śikhaṇḍin's death. When Śikhaṇḍin came
<div n="lb">to redeem his pledge, Sthūṇākarṇa related his curse and let
<div n="lb">him go. Drupada gave Śikhaṇḍin as a pupil to Droṇa,
<div n="lb">who taught him the fourfold {%(catuṣpādaṃ)%} Dhanurveda,
<div n="lb">along with the Dhārtarāṣṭras and Dhṛṣṭadyumna. It
<div n="lb">was Ambā who had been born as Śikhaṇḍin. Bhīṣma had
<div n="lb">made a vow not to shoot weapons against a woman, or
<div n="lb">one that had before been a woman, or one bearing a feminine
<div n="lb">name, or one whose form resembled that of a woman
<div n="lb">(V, {@192@}). Duryodhana asked in what time Bhīma, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), could annihilate the hostile army. Bhīṣma said he
<div n="lb">could do it in a month; Droṇa said the same; Kṛpa men-
<div n="lb">tioned two months; Aśvatthāman, ten nights; Karṇa, five
<div n="lb">nights. Bhīṣma ridiculed Karṇa, saying that he will think
<div n="lb">otherwise when he had encountered Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">(V, {@193@}). Having learnt this from his spies, Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">asked Arjuna the same question. Arjuna said that with
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa as his ally he could exterminate the three worlds
<div n="lb">with the gods, etc., in the twinkling of an eye; the weapon
<div n="lb">given him by Paśupati (i.e. Śiva) as a hunter {%(Kairāte%}
<div n="lb">{%dvandvayuddhe),%} which Paśupati used at the end of the {%yuga%}
<div n="lb">for destroying created things, was not known to Bhīṣma, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); he enumerated Yudhiṣṭhira's allies (<lang n="greek"></lang>); Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">was himself competent to exterminate the three worlds
<div n="lb">(V, {@194@}). Next morning, under a cloudless sky, the Kaurava
<div n="lb">army marched (description) to the field, first Vinda, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the second division; in the rear,
<div n="lb">Kṛtavarman, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), with the Dhārtarāṣṭras at their head.
<div n="lb">Duryodhana's encampment (description) looked like a second
<div n="lb">Hāstinapura (V, {@195@}). In the same way Yudhiṣṭhira also
<div n="lb">ordered out his troops, headed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, under
<div n="lb">Dhṛṣṭaketu, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), (description); first Abhimanyu, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); then Bhīma and Arjuna in the second division; last of
[Page033-a+ 62]
<div n="lb">all himself with Virāṭa and Drupada, etc. Then he disposed
<div n="lb">his divisions in a different order, confounding the Dhārtarā-
<div n="lb">ṣṭras: the Draupadeyas, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), under Bhīmasena; in the
<div n="lb">middle division, Virāṭa, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); in that part where Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira himself was, Cekitāna, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Yudhiṣṭhira was
<div n="lb">followed by Saucitti, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), (V, {@196@}).
