{@Śyenakapotīya(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating to the hawk
<div n="lb">and the pigeon”). § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2,@} 448 {%(°m%}
<div n="lb">{%upākhyānam).%}—§ 411 (Plakṣāv.): {%Indra%} in the shape of
<div n="lb">a hawk and {%Agni%} in that of a pigeon in fear of the hawk
<div n="lb">came to test king {%Uśīnara's%} merit (III, {@130@}). {%Uśīnara%}
<div n="lb">in vain offered the hawk another beast, and thereafter his
<div n="lb">kingdom, in order that he might spare the pigeon (“he
<div n="lb">who slays a {%brahman,%} he who slaughters a cow, the
<div n="lb">common mother of all the worlds, and he who forsakes
<div n="lb">one asking for protection, are equally sinful”); at last
<div n="lb">the hawk agreed upon receiving the pigeon's weight of
<div n="lb">{%Uśīnara's%} flesh; {%Uśīnara%} cut portion after portion of his
<div n="lb">flesh and placed it in the balance, and as it did not out-
<div n="lb">weigh the pigeon he mounted the scale himself, utterly
<div n="lb">devoid of flesh. Then {%Indra%} said: “As long as man shall
<div n="lb">speak of thee, so long…thou shalt inhabit the holy
<div n="lb">regions.” Saying this {%Indra%} ascended to heaven, and so did
<div n="lb">king {%Uśīnara%} in a radiant shape, after having filled heaven
<div n="lb">and earth with his merits (III, {@131@}).
