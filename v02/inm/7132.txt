[{@Manuṣyagrahakathana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“on the demons that
<div n="lb">possess mankind”). § 502 (cf. Skandop.). The six divorced
<div n="lb">wives of the {%ṛṣis,%} together with {%Vinatā,%} obtained permission
<div n="lb">from {%Skanda%} to become his mothers. At the request of
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} the {%Kṛttikās%} (i.e. the six wives of the {%ṛṣis%}) (together
<div n="lb">with {%Vinatā,%} see v. 14464 and Nīl.) are placed among the
<div n="lb">{%nakṣatras%} (and presided over by {%Agni%}) instead of {%Abhijit,%} the
<div n="lb">younger sister of {%Rohiṇī,%} who from jealousy had repaired to
<div n="lb">the woods. {%Brahmán%} ordered that time should be reckoned
<div n="lb">from {%Dhaniṣṭhā,%} while it had formerly been reckoned from
<div n="lb">{%Rohiṇī%} (so Nīl.). Then (these seven) mothers asked {%Skanda%}
<div n="lb">that they might become the mothers of the worlds instead of
<div n="lb">the old mothers ({%Brāhmī, Māheśvarī,%} etc.; Nīl.) and devour
<div n="lb">the progeny of those old mothers, because they had slandered
<div n="lb">them before their husbands, and always dwell with {%Skanda.%}
<div n="lb">{%Skanda%} granted that until the age of 16 years they should
<div n="lb">have the power of afflicting the human kind, and he
<div n="lb">loosed from his body his {%Raudra%} nature, under the name
<div n="lb">of {%Skandāpasmāra,%} that they might dwell with him.
<div n="lb">Enumeration of several grahas (the number 18 in v. 14490
<div n="lb">is difficult to explain), among others (<lang n="greek"></lang>) the male and female
<div n="lb">children of {%Skanda%} (the males are the husbands of the
<div n="lb">females); they are all named {%Skandagrahas;%} they are
<div n="lb">propitiated with offerings, ablutions, unguents, etc., and
<div n="lb">particularly by the worship of {%Skanda;%} and when they are
<div n="lb">propitiated they bestow good on men. Then are mentioned
<div n="lb">the {%grahas,%} that afflict men from the 16th to the 70th year;
<div n="lb">after the 70th year fever takes the place of the {%grahas.%}
<div n="lb">These evil spirits always avoid those who have subdued
<div n="lb">their senses, etc., and those who are devoted to {%Maheśvara%}
