{@Aṇīmāṇḍavyopākhyāna(ṃ).@}¦ § 172 (Sambhavap.):
<div n="lb">The history of {%Māṇḍavya%} (§ 80) is more fully described.
<div n="lb">Suspicion had fallen upon him, because thieves had hid
<div n="lb">their plunder in his hermitage, while he was sitting for years
<div n="lb">with his arms upraised observing the vow of silence. When
<div n="lb">impaled, he by his ascetic power not only preserved his life,
<div n="lb">but summoned other {%ṛṣis%} to the scene, who came in the
<div n="lb">night in the shape of birds (I, {@107@}). Hearing that he was
<div n="lb">alive, the king asked his pardon and endeavoured to extract
<div n="lb">the stake from his body, but was obliged to cut it off outside
<div n="lb">the body. {%Māṇḍavya%} henceforth walked about with the stake
<div n="lb">in his life, and thereby conquered {%lokas%} unattainable by others
<div n="lb">and was called {%Aṇīmāṇḍavya%} (v. 4329). He ruled that an
<div n="lb">act should not be sinful when committed by one below the
<div n="lb">age of 14 years (I, {@108@}).
