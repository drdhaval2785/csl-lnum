[{@Sudarśanopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Sudarśana”). § 720{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati Manu > Ikṣvāku >%} 100 sons; the tenth of those,
<div n="lb">{%Daśāśva,%} became the king of {%Māhiṣmatī; Daśāśva's%} son was
<div n="lb">the pious {%Madirāśva > Dyutimat > Suvīra > Sudurjaya >%} R-ṛ
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} in whose kingdom there was no miser, etc., and
<div n="lb">who was learned in the {%Vedas%} and {%Vedānta. Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">begat the beautiful {%Sudarśanā%} upon the river {%Narmadā;%}
<div n="lb">{%Agni,%} taking the shape of a brahman, demanded her hand from
<div n="lb">the king, who would not give her to him; then {%Agni%} vanished
<div n="lb">from his great sacrifice. {%Duryodhana%} repaired to the
<div n="lb">brahmans, who became informed of the matter by {%Agni;%}
<div n="lb">then the king consented, and {%Agni%} gave, as a marriage-
<div n="lb">dower, the boon to the king that he would always remain
<div n="lb">there, and {%Agni%} has always been present there to this day,
<div n="lb">and was seen by {%Sahadeva%} on his digvijaya. She bore to
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} the beautiful {%Sudarśana,%} who, even in his childhood,
<div n="lb">knew {%Bráhman. Sudarśana%} married {%Oghavatī,%} the daughter
<div n="lb">of king {%Oghavat%} and the sister of {%Ogharatha,%} and dwelt in
<div n="lb">{%Kurukṣetra;%} he took the vow of conquering death by leading
<div n="lb">the life of a householder. He instructed {%Oghavatī%} that, for
<div n="lb">pleasing a guest, she must not spare even her own person.
<div n="lb">One day, when {%Sudarśana%} went out to fetch firewood,
<div n="lb">a graceful brahman came to {%Oghavatī%} and required and
<div n="lb">obtained her own person. {%Mṛtyu,%} with his iron club, was
<div n="lb">always at the side of {%Sudarśana,%} watching him in order to
<div n="lb">find out his flaws. When {%Sudarśana%} came home he showed
<div n="lb">no anger. The brahman turned out to be {%Dharma,%} who was
<div n="lb">pleased with {%Sudarśana,%} and said: “you have conquered
<div n="lb">{%Mṛtyu%}”; {%Oghavatī%} has been protected from defilement by
<div n="lb">your virtue and by her own chastity; you will attain to all
<div n="lb">the worlds in this your body, and, as {%yoga%} is in the control of
<div n="lb">{%Oghavatī,%} she will follow you with half her corporeal self,
<div n="lb">being with the other half [the river] {%Oghavatī.%} Then {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">came, riding in a fine chariot, and approached that brahman.
