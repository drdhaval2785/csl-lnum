{@Sṛñjaya@}<sup>3</sup>,¦ father of Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin. § 595 (Abhimanyu-
<div n="lb">vadhap.): There was a king of the name {%Śaibya%} (C. {%°vya%}),
<div n="lb">his son was {%S.;%} the ṛṣis {%Nārada%} and {%Parvata%} were the
<div n="lb">friends of {%S.%} Seeing the daughter of {%S., Parvata%} asked if
<div n="lb">she was Śrī, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Nārada%} obtained her as his wife.
<div n="lb">{%Parvata%} cursed {%Nārada,%} saying that he should not go to heaven
<div n="lb">at his will, and {%Nārada%} (enumerating what constitutes a
<div n="lb">marriage) cursed {%Parvata,%} saying that he should not go to
<div n="lb">heaven without him. Meanwhile, king {%S.,%} desirous of
<div n="lb">a son, prevailed upon the brahmans to ask {%Nārada%} on his
<div n="lb">behalf, and, urged by {%Nārada,%} he prayed for a son
<div n="lb">possessed of every accomplishment, and whose urine, etc.
<div n="lb">should be of gold. This son was named {%Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin%}
<div n="lb">(“gold-spitter”), and increased the wealth [of his father]
<div n="lb">beyond all limits (description). Some robbers seized the
<div n="lb">prince and slew him, and cut his body into fragments but
<div n="lb">without finding any gold. The robbers then slew one another
<div n="lb">and sank into an unimaginably awful hell. To {%Sṛñjaya,%} who
<div n="lb">was afflicted with deep sorrow, the D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} told the
<div n="lb">{%Ṣoḍaśarājika%} (q.v.), i.e., the histories of sixteen kings who
<div n="lb">had died (except the last, viz. {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}), ending
<div n="lb">each narrative with the words: “as he died who was
<div n="lb">superior to thee and to thy son, thou shouldst not grieve for
<div n="lb">the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial
<div n="lb">present.” (Each narrative then ends with the words: {%Śvai-%}
<div n="lb">{%tyeti vyāharan%} [read {%vyāharat%}]; Nīl. takes Śvaitya (i.e. son of
<div n="lb">Śvitya) as a name of {%S.,%} cf. also XII, 1052) (VII, {@55-70@}).
