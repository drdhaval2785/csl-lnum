{@Hemakūṭa.@}¦ § 390{%b%} (Tīrthayātrāp.): On the mountain {%H.%}
<div n="lb">the utterance of words (so PCR., who follows the various
<div n="lb">reading cited by Nīl., {%“vācā yatra bhavan,”%} instead of {%“vātā-%}
<div n="lb">{%baddhā bhavan”%}) caused the gathering of clouds and stones
<div n="lb">by thousands. There the recitation of the sacred scriptures
<div n="lb">was heard, but nobody was seen; in the evening and the
<div n="lb">morning there was seen fire, and biting flies would interrupt
<div n="lb">the austerities. Lomaśa explained that formerly on this
<div n="lb">{%Ṛṣabhakūṭa%} (i.e. Hemakūṭa) dwelt a great and resentful ṛṣi,
<div n="lb">who was many hundred years old, and was named Ṛshabha.
<div n="lb">When practising austerities he had been spoken to by others,
<div n="lb">and in wrath he ordered the mountain to throw stones on him
<div n="lb">who should utter any word there, and forbade the wind to
<div n="lb">make any noise. Therefore, as soon as a man utters any word
<div n="lb">here he is forbidden by a roaring cloud. Formerly, when
<div n="lb">the gods came to the {%Nandā,%} many men came to see them, but
<div n="lb">the gods with Indra at their head did not like to be seen,
<div n="lb">and therefore they rendered the spot inaccessible by raising
<div n="lb">obstructions in the form of mountains, and from that day
<div n="lb">onwards men could not see that hill, far less ascend it.
<div n="lb">Lomaśa further said: “Here all the gods performed the best
<div n="lb">sacrifices, and the marks thereof may be seen to this day, the
<div n="lb">grass resembling {%kuśa%} grass, and many trees resembling {%yūpas;%}
<div n="lb">the gods and ṛṣis dwell there to this day, and it is their fire
<div n="lb">which is seen in the evening and the morning. By bathing
