<div n="lb">{%S°syātmajāḥ,%} all. to § 387).—§ 387 (Tīrthayātrāp.): At the
<div n="lb">request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Lomaśa%} said: King {%S.%} of the family
<div n="lb">of the {%Ikṣvākus%} had no sons. He subdued the {%Haihayas%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Tālajaṅgḥas.%} His wives were {%Vaidarbhī%} and {%Śaibyā.%}
<div n="lb">With them he on {%Kailāsa%} practised ascetic austerities in order
<div n="lb">to obtain a son, and practising yoga he succeeded in seeing
<div n="lb">{%Śiva,%} who said that owing to the {%muhūrta%} at which {%S.%} had
<div n="lb">addressed his prayers to him, one of the wives of {%S.%} would
<div n="lb">have 60,000 sons of exceeding pride, who should perish
<div n="lb">altogether, and the other wife would have one valorous son,
<div n="lb">who would perpetuate the race of {%S.%} Then {%Śiva%} disappeared
<div n="lb">and {%S.%} and his wives went home. {%Vaidarbhī%} after some time
<div n="lb">brought forth a gourd and {%Śaibyā%} a beautiful son. As {%S.%} was
<div n="lb">about to throw away the gourd, a voice from the sky told him
[Page604-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">to take out the seeds and preserve them in steaming vessels
<div n="lb">partly filled with clarified butter, as they would become
<div n="lb">60,000 sons (III, {@106@}). The {%rājarṣi S.%} did as he was told,
<div n="lb">and provided a nurse for every receptacle. When they were
<div n="lb">born their acts were ruthless, they were able to roam about
<div n="lb">in the sky and harassed the gods, the {%Gandharvas,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas,%} and all beings. The gods, etc., went to Brahmán,
<div n="lb">who dismissed them saying that in a short time the sons
<div n="lb">of {%S.%} would be destroyed. When after some time they
<div n="lb">were protecting {%S.'s%} sacrificial horse who roamed over the
<div n="lb">world, the horse suddenly disappeared when it had come to
<div n="lb">the waterless sea. Having told {%S.%} that the horse had been
<div n="lb">stolen, they were commanded to search for it, but they did
<div n="lb">not find it. {%S.%} then filled with wrath forbade them to return
<div n="lb">without the horse. They then began to dig the sea with
<div n="lb">spades, etc., and killed {%Asuras, Uragas%} (snakes), {%Rākṣasas,%}
<div n="lb">and other beings by hundreds and thousands. After a long
<div n="lb">time they dug down to {%Pātāla%} in the north-eastern region,
<div n="lb">and seeing the horse there they ran after it without heeding
<div n="lb">{%Kapila%} (“whom they say is Vāsudeva,” v. 8880), who was
<div n="lb">present there. {%Kapila%} then burnt them to ashes. {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">told it to {%S.,%} who sent for {%Aṃśumat,%} the son of his son
<div n="lb">{%Asamañjas,%} whom he had abandoned according to his duty
<div n="lb">and for the good of the citizens: III, {@106,@} 8830, 8831
