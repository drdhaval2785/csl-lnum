[{@Skandotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“origin of Skanda”).—§ 495 (Mārk.).
<div n="lb">{%Mārkanḍeya%} promised to tell the story of {%Kārttikeya,%} the son
<div n="lb">of {%Adbhuta,%} begotten of the wives of the {%Brahmarṣis.%}
<div n="lb">Formerly, when the {%Asuras%} always defeated the gods, {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">anxious to find out a leader for the celestial host, repaired to
<div n="lb">the {%Mānasa%} mountain, and, hearing a woman crying for
<div n="lb">protection, rescued her from the {%Asura Keśin,%} whom he
<div n="lb">wounded and put to flight (III, {@223@}). She told {%Indra%} that
<div n="lb">she was {%Devasenā,%} daughter of {%Prajāpati,%} and that her sister
<div n="lb">{%Daityasenā%} had let herself be taken away by {%Keśin%} from the
<div n="lb">{%Mānasa%} mountain, where they used to sport with their female
<div n="lb">friends with the permission of {%Prajāpati. Indra%} said that she
<div n="lb">was a sister's daughter of his mother {%Dākṣāyaṇī.%} She asked
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} to select a husband for her, who was able to conquer
<div n="lb">the gods, {%Dānavas, Yakṣas, Kinnaras, Uragas, Rakṣas,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Daityas. Indra%} was grieved, thinking there was no such
<div n="lb">husband for her.—§ 496. Then {%Indra%} perceived the Sun
<div n="lb">rising from the {%Udaya%} hill, and {%Soma%} (the Moon) entering the
<div n="lb">Sun on the {%amāvasyā%} (new-moon day) at the {%Raudra muhūrta,%}
<div n="lb">and the gods and {%Asuras%} fighting on the {%Udaya%} mountain,
<div n="lb">the morning twilight tinged with red clouds, the Sea blood-
<div n="lb">red; {%Bhṛgus%} and {%Aṅgirases%} offered oblations, and {%Agni%} took
<div n="lb">the oblations and entered the Sun, whilst the Sun was
<div n="lb">entering the twenty-fourth {%parvan,%} and {%Sindhu%} was flowing
<div n="lb">with a current of fresh blood, etc. {%Indra%} thought that, if
<div n="lb">now {%Soma%} or {%Agni%} gave birth to a son, this son might become
<div n="lb">the husband of {%Devasenā.%} Then he repaired with {%Devasenā%}
<div n="lb">to the world of {%Brahmán,%} who promised that it should be as
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} had thought. Then {%Indra.%} with {%Devasenā,%} repaired to
<div n="lb">the place where the {%devarṣis Vasiṣṭha,%} etc. lived, and the
<div n="lb">gods also came thither to drink {%soma%} and receive their shares
<div n="lb">of offerings, and the {%Adbhuta%} fire came from the solar disc to
<div n="lb">the {%āhavanīya%} and made over the offerings to the gods. He,
<div n="lb">(Adbhuta), then saw the wives of the {%ṛṣis%} sleeping in their
<div n="lb">{%āśramas%} and fell in love. In order to look at them daily, he
<div n="lb">entered the {%gārhapatya%} fire, and dwelt there for a long time,
<div n="lb">and at last, from despair, repaired to a forest in order to do
<div n="lb">away with himself. {%Svāhā,%} daughter of {%Dakṣa,%} who had in
<div n="lb">vain loved {%Adbhuta,%} now resolved upon assuming the guise of
<div n="lb">the wives of the seven {%ṛṣis%} (III, {@224@}). {%Svāhā%} first gratified
[Page644-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">her desire in the guise of {%Śivā,%} the wife of {%Aṅgiras,%} and then,
<div n="lb">lest somebody should unduly suspect the brāhmaṇa ladies,
<div n="lb">she went out of the forest in the guise of a bird {%(garuḍī,%}
<div n="lb">{%suparṇī),%} and on the {%Śveta%} mountain, that was covered with
<div n="lb">clumps of reeds and guarded with seven-headed poisonous
<div n="lb">serpents, {%rākṣasas, Piśācas,%} etc., she threw the semen, which
<div n="lb">she held in her hand, into a golden basin. Then, assuming
<div n="lb">successively the form of five of the others, she did the same
<div n="lb">on the first lunar day {%(pratipadi).%} Only the form of
<div n="lb">{%Arundhatī%} she was unable to assume because of her ascetic
<div n="lb">merit and devotion to her husband. The semen produced a
<div n="lb">child, whom the {%ṛṣis%} called {%Skanda%} (etymology v. 14315),
<div n="lb">with six heads, etc. On the second day it first assumed a
<div n="lb">form, on the 3rd it looked like a little child, on the fourth
<div n="lb">the limbs were developed. Seizing the bow used by the
<div n="lb">destroyer of {%Tripura, Skanda%} uttered a terrible roar, so that
<div n="lb">the great {%nāgas Citra%} and {%Airāvata%} sprang up. But {%Skanda%}
<div n="lb">seized them with two of his hands, and holding a dart in one
<div n="lb">hand, a cock in another, etc., and blowing a conch-shell, he
<div n="lb">terrified the creatures with his roars. The persons of various
<div n="lb">orders, who then sought the protection of {%Skanda,%} are called
<div n="lb">his followers by the brahmans ({%pāriṣadān brāhmaṇān,%} read
<div n="lb">{%brāhmaṇāḥ%}). Discharging his arrows in the direction of the
<div n="lb">{%Śveta%} mountain, he rent asunder the mountain {%Krauñca,%} the
<div n="lb">son of {%Himavat;%} therefore the swans and vultures go to
<div n="lb">the mountain {%Meru.%} The other mountains also screamed
<div n="lb">aloud. Then, with his lance, he rent in twain one of the
<div n="lb">peaks of the {%Śveta%} mountain. Mount {%Śveta%} and the other
<div n="lb">mountains left the Earth and fled: the Earth was torn
<div n="lb">asunder on all sides; she went to {%Skanda%} and regained her
<div n="lb">power; the mountains bowed down to {%Skanda%} and came back
<div n="lb">to the Earth, and all creatures worshipped {%Skanda%} on the
<div n="lb">fifth day of the lunar month (III, {@225@}).—§ 497. Terrific
<div n="lb">prodigies were seen everywhere. The {%ṛṣis%} tried to restore
<div n="lb">tranquillity to the universe. The inhabitants of the {%Caitra-%}
<div n="lb">{%ratha%} forest accused the wives of the six {%ṛṣis,%} other ones the
<div n="lb">fowl {%(garuḍī)%} of being the cause thereof; but nobody suspected
<div n="lb">{%Svāhā.%} The seven {%ṛṣis%} divorced their wives with the
<div n="lb">exception of {%Arundhatī,%} though {%Svāhā%} claimed the child as
<div n="lb">hers. {%Viśvāmitra,%} having concluded the sacrifice of the
<div n="lb">seven {%ṛṣis,%} had secretly followed the god of fire, and knew
<div n="lb">everything as it had happened. He sought the protection of
<div n="lb">{%Skanda,%} and performed for him the thirteen auspicious rites
<div n="lb">of childhood {%(maṅgalāni kaumārāṇi):%} the {%jālakarman,%} etc., etc.
<div n="lb">Though {%Viśvāmitra%} informed the seven {%ṛṣis%} of the innocence
<div n="lb">of their wives, yet they abandoned them unconditionally.—
<div n="lb">§ 498. The gods asked {%Indra%} to kill {%Skanda,%} but he dared
<div n="lb">not attack him, saying that {%Skanda%} was able to destroy even
<div n="lb">the Creator of the world. Then they let the Mothers of the
<div n="lb">world approach in order to kill {%Skanda,%} but they adopted him
<div n="lb">as their son and let him suck their breasts, especially the
<div n="lb">daughter of {%Krodha%} with a spike in her hand, and the
<div n="lb">daughter of the Red Sea, who lived on blood; and his father
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} came and, transformed into {%Naigameya%} (see BR.) with
<div n="lb">a goat's month, gratified him with toys (III, {@226@}).
