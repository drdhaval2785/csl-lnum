{@[Kṛtaghnopākhyāna(ṃ)]@}¦ (“the episode about an un-
<div n="lb">grateful person”). § 658{%b%} (Āpaddh.): {%Bhīṣma%} related:
<div n="lb">{%Gautama,%} a brahman, belonging to the middle country, devoid
<div n="lb">of {%Vedic%} learning, entered a village desirous of obtaining
[Page427-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">charity. In that village lived a robber {%(dasyu),%} possessed of
<div n="lb">great wealth, devoted to the {%brahmans,%} etc. He gave to
<div n="lb">{%Gautama%} a piece of new cloth, a widowed {%(bhartrā virahitāṃ)%}
<div n="lb">young woman, and a house. {%Gautama%} lived happily in that
<div n="lb">village of aborigines {%(śabarālaye)%} for many years, helping the
<div n="lb">relatives of his wife, the female slave {%(dāsī).%} He began to
<div n="lb">practise archery, and went into the woods and killed wild
<div n="lb">cranes {%(cakrāṅgān),%} etc., in abundance, and became like
<div n="lb">one of the robbers. One day a {%brahman,%} devoted to the study
<div n="lb">of the {%Vedas,%} etc., and who did never accept any food if given
<div n="lb">by a {%Śūdra,%} came to the house of his ancient friend {%Gautama.%}
<div n="lb">Seeing {%Gautama,%} who resembled a cannibal, he exhorted him
<div n="lb">to abandon his sinful mode of life. {%Gautama,%} repenting, agreed
<div n="lb">to leave this village next morning with his guest, who passed
<div n="lb">the night there, refraining touching anything (though hungry)
<div n="lb">(XII, {@168@}). Next morning, when the guest had left the
<div n="lb">house, {%Gautama%} proceeded towards the sea, having met with
<div n="lb">a caravan of merchants. The caravan was assailed by an
<div n="lb">infuriated elephant, but {%Gautama%} managed to escape, and fled
<div n="lb">towards the north, not knowing whither he proceeded,
<div n="lb">wandering alone in the forest like a {%kimpuruṣa.%} At last he
<div n="lb">reached a delightful forest, resembling the very woods of
<div n="lb">{%Nandana,%} and inhabited by {%Y.%} and {%K.,%} adorned with {%Śālas,%}
<div n="lb">etc., with {%Bhāruṇḍas%} (having faces resembling those of human
<div n="lb">beings), {%Bhūliṅgas,%} etc. Under a delightful banyan-tree
<div n="lb">(description) he fell asleep; when the sun had set, the king of
<div n="lb">cranes, {%Nāḍījaṅgha%} or {%Rājadharman, Kaśyapa's%} son, the child
<div n="lb">of a celestial maiden {%(devakanyāsutaḥ),%} one of the daughters
<div n="lb">of {%Dakṣa%} (v. 6343), and possessed of great wisdom and a
<div n="lb">friend of {%Brahmán,%} came home from {%Brahmaloka.%} Exhausted
<div n="lb">with hunger and thirst, {%Gautama%} thought of slaying him.
<div n="lb">{%Nāḍījaṅgha%} welcomed {%Gautama,%} and asked him to stay with
<div n="lb">him till the next morning (XII, {@169@}). He, who equalled
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} himself in his knowledge of duties, made for him a bed
<div n="lb">of the {%śāla%} flowers, and offered him large fishes from the
<div n="lb">{%Bhāgīrathī,%} etc. Learning that he was desirous of going to
<div n="lb">the sea in order to earn wealth, he, quoting {%Bṛhaspati%} as to
<div n="lb">the fourfold means of earning wealth, directed him in the
<div n="lb">morning to his friend, the chief of the {%Rākṣasas, Virūpākṣa,%}
<div n="lb">about 3 {%yojanas%} away. {%Gautama%} reached the city of {%Meruvraja%}
<div n="lb">(description), and was welcomed by {%Virūpākṣa%} (XII, {@170@}).
<div n="lb">Though not satisfied with {%Gautama's%} antecedents, {%Virūpākṣa,%}
<div n="lb">because {%Gautama%} was a brahman, and for the sake of {%Rāja-%}
<div n="lb">{%dharman,%} entertained him with the 1,000 {%brahmans%} that were
<div n="lb">to be entertained in his house on the day of full moon of the
<div n="lb">{%Kārttika%} month (description). Some amongst them were
<div n="lb">selected to represent the V.-D., P., and the deities of fire.
<div n="lb">This he did every year on the {%Āṣāḍhī%} and {%Māghī,%} and especially
<div n="lb">on the {%Kārttikī,%} after the expiry of the autumn, giving away
<div n="lb">gold, jewels, etc.; on this one day there was no fear of {%Rā.%}
<div n="lb">{%Gautama%} came away with much wealth, and returned to
<div n="lb">{%Rājadharman,%} who welcomed him. Having no food to live on
<div n="lb">by the way, he thought of slaying {%Rājadharman%} (XII, {@170@}).
<div n="lb">This he did; having plucked off the feathers and the down,
<div n="lb">he roasted the flesh, and taking it up together with the gold
<div n="lb">he had brought, he quickly fled from the spot. The next
<div n="lb">day {%Virūpākṣa%} became anxious because he had not for
<div n="lb">two mornings and two nights seen {%Rājadharman,%} who when
<div n="lb">returning from {%Brahmaloka%} every morning never went home
<div n="lb">without paying him a visit; he suspected that {%Gautama%} had
<div n="lb">slain him, and sent his son with other Rā. to inquire after him.
<div n="lb">{%Gautama%} was caught and brought to {%Meruvraja;%} as the Rā.
<div n="lb">refused to eat the flesh of that great sinner, he was hacked
[Page427-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">into pieces, which were given away to the robbers. But the
<div n="lb">very robbers, though cannibals, refused to eat the flesh of that
<div n="lb">vile man (XII, {@172@}). {%Virūpākṣa%} caused a funeral pyre,
<div n="lb">etc., to be made for {%Rājadharman.%} At that time the goddess
<div n="lb">{%Surabhi,%} the daughter of {%Dakṣa,%} appeared in the sky above
<div n="lb">the pyre; from her mouth froth mixed with milk fell upon the
<div n="lb">funeral pyre, and {%Rājadharman%} became revived. {%Indra%} came
<div n="lb">and related that once {%Rājadharman%} had absented himself from
<div n="lb">{%Brahmaloka%} and was cursed by {%Brahmán,%} who said that he
<div n="lb">should not die soon; “therefore he has come back to life.”
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Rājadharman%} on behalf of his “dear friend
<div n="lb">{%Gautama%}”, {%Indra%} sprinkled {%amṛta%} over {%Gautama,%} and restored
<div n="lb">him to life. {%Rājadharman%} embraced him with great joy,
<div n="lb">dismissed him with his wealth, and returned home. At the
<div n="lb">due hour he repaired to {%Brahmaloka%} and was honoured by
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán. Gautama%} begot many sinful children upon his
<div n="lb">{%Śūdrā%} wife. According to a heavy curse denounced upon
<div n="lb">him by the gods, he afterwards had to sink into a terrible
<div n="lb">hell for many years. “All this was recited to me formerly
<div n="lb">by Nārada.”
