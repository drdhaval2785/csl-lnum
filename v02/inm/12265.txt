[{@Vrīhidrauṇikaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“on the droṇa of rice”,
<div n="lb">the 45th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 519. Dwelling
<div n="lb">in the woods, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} spent eleven years in a miserable
<div n="lb">plight, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} repenting of his act of gambling, and
<div n="lb">the others thinking of revenge. Once {%Vyāsa%} came to them
<div n="lb">and spoke to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the meritoriousness of
<div n="lb">asceticism, saying that a wise man, knowing that life has its
<div n="lb">ups and downs, is neither filled with joy nor with grief,
<div n="lb">while foolish persons are reborn as beasts in after life;
<div n="lb">nothing in this world is more difficult to practise than
<div n="lb">charity, and therefore charity is superior to everything; even
<div n="lb">a small gift may be of great result in future life, provided
<div n="lb">that what is given away is properly acquired and, with a
<div n="lb">pure mind and in due time, bestowed on pious persons; but
<div n="lb">the bestowal of ill-gotten gains can never rescue the giver
<div n="lb">from evil (III, {@259@}).—§ 520: Mudgala (q.v.)
