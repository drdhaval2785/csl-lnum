<div n="lb">employed Rā.-illusion, and even destroyed the celestial
<div n="lb">weapon of {%Karṇa;%} a {%Vāyavya%} weapon was employed by
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} to destroy clouds; {%Ghaṭotkaca%} was once seen on a

<div n="lb">other Rā.; {%Arjuna%} himself should resist {%Droṇa's%} division;
<div n="lb">then {%Kṛṣṇa%} dispatched {%Ghaṭotkaca%} to protect {%Bhīmasena%}
<div n="lb">(VII, {@177@}). {%Ghaṭotkaca%} (abandoning {%Karṇa%}) & {%Alāyudha%}
<div n="lb">(brother of {%Baka%}). Meanwhile, {%Yuyudhāna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), & the
<div n="lb">Rā. of {%Alāyudha; Arjuna%} shot many {%kṣatriyas, Karṇa%} many
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas%} headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Śikhaṇḍin,%} etc. {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">{%+ Nakula,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (having slain the Rā.) & {%Karṇa;%} the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas & Droṇa; Alāyudha%} resorted to his power of illusion,
<div n="lb">and so did {%Ghaṭotkaca,%} who cut off the head of {%Alāyudha%} and
<div n="lb">threw it down before {%Duryodhana,%} who, with all his troops,
<div n="lb">became full of anxiety, while the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} roared
<div n="lb">like lions (VII, {@178@}). {%Karṇa%} & the {%Pāñcālas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">many of them entered the force of {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Ghaṭotkaca &%}
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} who had his steeds and charioteer slain by {%Ghaṭotkaca,%}
<div n="lb">who then disappeared from view, and created a terrible
<div n="lb">illusion (description), which severely afflicted the {%Kuru%} host,
<div n="lb">which at last fled; {%Karṇa%} alone kept his ground, looked at by
<div n="lb">all the {%Saindhavas%} and {%Bāhlikas; Karṇa's%} steeds were again
<div n="lb">slain by {%Ghaṭotkaca,%} and his celesṭial weapon was baffled by
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkava's%} illusion. The {%Kauravas%} urged him to slay
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca%} with the dart presented to him by {%Indra,%} without
<div n="lb">minding {%Bhīma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). When {%Karṇa%} held the dart in
<div n="lb">his hands {%Ghaṭotkaca%} began to fly away in fear, all creatures
<div n="lb">in the skies uttered loud cries, etc.; {%Karṇa%} hurled the dart,
<div n="lb">and {%Ghaṭotkaca%} was slain, and falling upon the {%Kaurava%}
<div n="lb">army with his gigantic body, he slew a full {%akṣauhiṇī,%}
<div n="lb">desirous of benefiting the {%Pāṇḍavas.%} The {%Kauravas%} uttered
<div n="lb">loud shouts of joy; {%Karṇa%} ascended the chariot of {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">and entered the {%Kuru%} host (VII, {@179@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were
<div n="lb">filled with grief; only {%Kṛṣṇa%} with transports of delight
[Page307-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">raised his warcry, embracing {%Arjuna,%} to whom he explained
<div n="lb">that he rejoiced because {%Karṇa's%} dart could not now
<div n="lb">kill {%Arjuna,%} having been employed against {%Ghaṭotkaca;%} he
<div n="lb">recited to {%Arjuna%} how he had gradually caused all the foes of
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to be slain (VII, {@180@}), which he explained
<div n="lb">more explicitly (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VII, {@181@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">why {%Karṇa%} had not hurled the fatal dart at {%Arjuna, Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">assigned {%Kṛṣṇa's%} policy as the reason (<lang n="greek"></lang>), though it had
<div n="lb">formed the subject of deliberation with {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">every night. {%Sātyaki%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} why {%Karṇa%} had not
<div n="lb">hurled his dart at {%Arjuna; Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Duḥśāsana,%}
<div n="lb">etc., had frequently discussed this subject, and {%Karṇa%} had
<div n="lb">approved of it; but {%Kṛṣṇa%} always used to stupefy him;
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} had neither sleep nor joy in his heart, as long as he
<div n="lb">could not frustrate that instrument for killing {%Arjuna%} (VII,
<div n="lb">{@182@}). Concluding from {%Karṇa's%} not using the dart (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} attributed the ill success of the {%Kurus%} to
<div n="lb">Destiny, their own folly, and the policy of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and asked
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} about the battle (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Sañjaya%} related: All the
<div n="lb">{%Kauravas%} uttered loud shouts and began to slay the {%Pāṇḍava%}
<div n="lb">troops. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told {%Bhīmasena%} to resist the {%Dhārta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra%} host, himself sitting down with tearful face; {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">comforted him, but {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} remembered the many services
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca%} had rendered them (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Droṇa%} and {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">were the real cause of {%Abhimanyu's%} slaughter, but it was
<div n="lb">{%Jayadratha%} who was slain; “{%Droṇa%} and {%Karṇa%} are the root
<div n="lb">of our woes”; therefore {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} will slay {%Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena%} being engaged with {%Droṇa's%} division. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">quickly proceeded against {%Karṇa,%} followed by the {%Pāñcālas,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vyāsa%} approached {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and congratulated
<div n="lb">him upon {%Karṇa's%} having employed his dart against {%Ghaṭotkaca;%}
<div n="lb">“on the 5th day from hence the earth will be thine.” Then
<div n="lb">he disappeared (VII, {@183@}).
