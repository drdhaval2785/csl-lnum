{@Śakuntalopākhyāna(ṃ),@}¦ “episode relating to Śakun-
<div n="lb">talā.” § 133 (Sambhav.): I, {@68—70:@} {%Duṣyanta%} (q.v.) saw
<div n="lb">{%Śakuntalā%} (§ 134), daughter of {%Viśvāmitra%} (q.v.) and {%Menakā.%}—
<div n="lb">§ 135: Enumeration of the eight forms of marriage according
<div n="lb">to {%Manu. Duṣyanta,%} during the absence of {%Kaṇva,%} wedded
<div n="lb">{%Śakuntalā%} according to the {%Gāndharva%} form, promising her
<div n="lb">that her son should be the heir apparent, and departing told
<div n="lb">her that he should send troops to take her to his capital.
<div n="lb">{%Kaṇva,%} by his spiritual knowledge, knew what she had done,
<div n="lb">and approved of it, and bestowed on her the boon that the
<div n="lb">{%Paurava%} monarchs might ever be virtuous and never be
[Page186-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">deprived of their thrones (I, {@73@}). {%Śakuntalā,%} after three
<div n="lb">years, brought forth a beautiful boy, for whom {%Kaṇva%} caused
<div n="lb">all the religious rites to be performed, and who, when he
<div n="lb">was only 6 years of age, used to seize and bind to the trees
<div n="lb">lions, etc., wherefore he was called {%Sarvadamana.%} Then
<div n="lb">{%Kaṇva%} caused his disciples to bring {%Śakuntalā%} and the boy to
<div n="lb">{%Hāstinapura%} and introduce them to {%Duṣyanta.%} Then they
<div n="lb">returned to the hermitage. {%Duṣyanta%} feigned not to remember
<div n="lb">anything. Then {%Śakuntalā%} became angry (“But knowest
<div n="lb">thou not the Ancient Wise [{%muniṃ purāṇaṃ,%} i.e. Nārāyaṇa]
<div n="lb">who lies in the heart? He who sins is observed by the gods
<div n="lb">and by him also who occupies every heart. The sun, the
<div n="lb">moon, the air, fire, earth, sky, water, the heart, {%Yama,%} the
<div n="lb">day, the night, both twilights, and {%Dharma,%} all witness the
<div n="lb">acts of man. {%Yama Vaivasvata%} takes no account of the sins
<div n="lb">of that person with whom [Nārāyaṇa] the witness of all acts
<div n="lb">is gratified. But that person with whom he [Nārāyaṇa] is
<div n="lb">not gratified is tortured for his sins by {%Yama…%} The
<div n="lb">son that is born to persons cognizant of the {%Vedic mantras%}
<div n="lb">rescues the spirits of deceased ancestors. Because the son
<div n="lb">rescues the father from the hell which is called {%Put,%} therefore
<div n="lb">he has been called {%puttra%} by {%Svayambhū%} himself…
<div n="lb">Even {%ṛṣis%} cannot create creatures without women…
<div n="lb">‘He shall perform a hundred horse sacrifices,’ were the words
<div n="lb">uttered in the skies when I was in the lying-in room…

<div n="lb">has said that there are five kinds of sons…”). Then
<div n="lb">she left his presence. But a voice from the sky commanded
<div n="lb">{%Duṣyanta%} to cherish {%(bhara)%} his son, who should therefore be
<div n="lb">called {%Bharata.%} It was this voice of the {%Devadūta%} that
<div n="lb">{%Duṣyanta%} had waited for, that the people should not regard
<div n="lb">his son as of impure birth. {%Bharata%} reduced to subjection all
<div n="lb">the kings of the earth and became a {%sārvabhauma-cakravartin,%}
<div n="lb">and performed many sacrifices with {%Kaṇva%} as the chief priest.
<div n="lb">From him has come the {%Bharata%} race, of whom the principal
<div n="lb">ones shall be mentioned (I, {@74@}).
