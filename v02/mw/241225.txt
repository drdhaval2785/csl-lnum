the twenty-fifth being <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> or Spirit [sometimes called Soul] which is neither a Producer nor Production [see <s>vikAra</s>], but wholly distinct from the twenty-four other <s1 slp1="tattva">Tattva</s1>s, and is multitudinous, each separate <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> by its union with <s1 slp1="prakfti">Prakṛti</s1> causing a separate creation out of <s1 slp1="prakfti">Prakṛti</s1>, the object of the philosophy being to effect the final liberation of the <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> or Spirit from the fetters caused by that creation;
the <s1 slp1="yoga">Yoga</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>] branch of the <s1 slp1="sAMKya">Sāṃkhya</s1> recognizes a Supreme Spirit dominating each separate <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1>;
the <s1 slp1="tantra">Tantra</s1>s identify <s1 slp1="prakfti">Prakṛti</s1> with the wives of the gods, <ab>esp.</ab> with the wife of <s1 slp1="Siva">Śiva</s1>;
the oldest systematic exposition of the <ab n="Sāṃkhya" slp1="sAMKya">S°</ab> seems to have been by an author called <s1 slp1="paYca-SiKa">Pañca-śikha</s1> [the germ, however, being found in the <s1 slp1="zazwi-tantra">Ṣaṣṭi-tantra</s1>, of which only scanty fragments are extant];
the original <s1 slp1="sUtra">Sūtra</s1>s were superseded by the <ab n="Sāṃkhya-kārikā" slp1="sAMKya-kArikA">S°</ab> of <s1 slp1="ISvara-kfzRa">Īśvara-kṛṣṇa</s1>, the oldest manual on the <ab n="Sāṃkhya" slp1="sAMKya">S°</ab> system that has come down to us and probably written in the 5th century A.D., while the <ab n="Sāṃkhya" slp1="sAMKya">S°</ab>-<s1 slp1="sUtra">sūtra</s1>s or <ab n="Śiva-pravacana" slp1="Siva-pravacana">Ś°</ab> and <s1 slp1="tattva-samAsa">Tattva-samāsa</s1>, ascribed to the sage <s1 slp1="kapila">Kapila</s1>, are now thought to belong to as late a date as the 14th or 15th century or perhaps a little later), <ls>ŚvetUp.</ls>;
