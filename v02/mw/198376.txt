both <s1 slp1="rAvaRa">Rāvaṇa</s1> and <s1 slp1="viBIzaRa">Vibhīṣaṇa</s1> are said to have propitiated <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1> by their penances, so that the god granted them both boons, and the boon chosen by <ab n="Vibhīṣaṇa" slp1="viBIzaRa">V°</ab> was that he should never, even in the greatest calamity, stoop to any mean action;
hence he is represented in the <s1 slp1="rAmAyaRa">Rāmāyaṇa</s1> as endeavouring to counteract the malice of his brother <s1 slp1="rAvaRa">Rāvaṇa</s1>, in consequence of which he was so ill-treated by him that, leaving <s1 slp1="laNkA">Laṅkā</s1>, he joined <s1 slp1="rAma">Rāma</s1>, by whom, after the death of <s1 slp1="rAvaRa">Rāvaṇa</s1>, <ab n="Vibhīṣaṇa" slp1="viBIzaRa">V°</ab> was placed on the throne of <s1 slp1="laNkA">Laṅkā</s1>), <ls>MBh.</ls>;
