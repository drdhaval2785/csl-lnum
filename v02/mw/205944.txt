¦ <ab>N.</ab> of the second and most important part of the <s1 slp1="mImAMsA">Mīmāṉsā</s1> or third of the three great divisions of <ns>Hindū</ns> philosophy (called <s1 slp1="vedAnta">Vedânta</s1> either as teaching the ultimate scope of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> or simply as explained in the <s1 slp1="upanizad">Upaniṣad</s1>s which come at the end of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>;
this system, although belonging to the <s1 slp1="mImAMsA">Mīmāṉsā</s1> [q.v.] and sometimes called <s1 slp1="uttara-mImAMsA">Uttara-mīmāṉsā</s1>, ‘examination of the later portion or <s>jYAna-kARqa</s> [q.v.] of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>’, is really the one sole orthodox exponent of the pantheistic creed of the <ns>Hindūs</ns> of the present day - a creed which underlies all the polytheism and multiform mythology of the people;
its chief doctrine [as expounded by <s1 slp1="SaMkara">Śaṃkara</s1>] is that of <s1 slp1="advEta">Advaita</s1> <ab>i.e.</ab> that nothing really exists but the One Self or Soul of the Universe called <s1 slp1="brahman">Brahman</s1> [neut.] or <s1 slp1="paramAtman">Paramâtman</s1>, and that the <s1 slp1="jIvAtman">Jīvâtman</s1> or individual human soul and indeed all the phenomena of nature are really identical with the <s1 slp1="paramAtman">Paramâtman</s1>, and that their existence is only the result of <s1 slp1="ajYAna">Ajñāna</s1> [otherwise called <s1 slp1="avidyA">Avidyā</s1>] or an assumed ignorance on the part of that one universal Soul which is described as both Creator and Creation;
Actor and Act;
Existence, Knowledge and Joy, and as devoid of the three qualities [see <s>guRa</s>];
the liberation of the human soul, its deliverance from transmigrations, and re-union with the <s1 slp1="paramAtman">Paramâtman</s1>, with which it is really identified, is only to be effected by a removal of that ignorance through a proper understanding of the <s1 slp1="vedAnta">Vedânta</s1>;
this system is also called <s1 slp1="brahma-mImAMsA">Brahma-mīmāṉsā</s1> and <s1 slp1="SArIrakamImAMsA">Śārīrakamīmāṉsā</s1>, ‘inquiring into Spirit or embodied Spirit’;
the founder of the school is said to have been <s1 slp1="vyAsa">Vyāsa</s1>, also called <s1 slp1="bAdarAyaRa">Bādarāyaṇa</s1>, and its most eminent teacher was <s1 slp1="SaMkarAcArya">Śaṃkarâcārya</s1>), <ls>Up.</ls>;
