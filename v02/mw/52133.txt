she afterwards became one of the wives of <s1 slp1="pARqu">Pāṇḍu</s1>;
on one occasion before her marriage she paid such respect to the powerful sage <s1 slp1="durvAsas">Durvāsas</s1> that he taught her an incantation or charm, by virtue of which she was to have a child by any god she liked to invoke;
