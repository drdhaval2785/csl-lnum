the version belonging to the former is best known, and is divided into fourteen <s1 slp1="kARqa">Kāṇḍa</s1>s or books which contain one hundred <s1 slp1="aDyAya">Adhyāya</s1>s or lectures [or according to another arrangement into sixty-eight <s1 slp1="prapAWaka">Prapāṭhaka</s1>s];
the whole work is regarded as the most systematic and interesting of all the <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1>s, and though intended mainly for ritual and sacrificial purposes, is full of curious mythological details and legends;
