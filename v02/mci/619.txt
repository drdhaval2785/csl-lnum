<div n="lb">10. 12. 15, 16, 18) by Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu
<div n="lb">{%vaiṣṇavam cakraṃ%} 5. 96. 18), often referred

<div n="lb">in the form of Viṣṇu's cakra ({%vaiṣṇavaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%cakram%}) in Varuṇa's lake 5. 96. 18; at the
<div n="lb">time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest, god
<div n="lb">Agni asked Varuṇa to give for his sake the
<div n="lb">Cakra to Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) with which he
<div n="lb">would execute a great deed (cf. also 16. 4. 3);
<div n="lb">Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request (1. 216. 4)
<div n="lb">and gave the Cakra, here called Āgneya
<div n="lb">astra, to Kṛṣṇa; Agni told Kṛṣṇa that,
<div n="lb">equipped with the Cakra, he would defeat
<div n="lb">even superhuman beings in battle; he would
<div n="lb">be superior to men, gods, demons, Piśācas,
<div n="lb">Daityas and serpents when in battle he
<div n="lb">was opposed by a very strong enemy; when-
<div n="lb">ever Kṛṣṇa hurled in battle the Cakra
<div n="lb">against his enemies, it would kill the enemy
<div n="lb">without resistance and return to Kṛṣṇa's hand
<div n="lb">1. 216. 21-24; Kṛṣṇa felt fully prepared to

<div n="lb">Arjuna felt confident that there was nothing

<div n="lb">the Cakra for use in battle 1. 216. 28;
<div n="lb">according to the information of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa received the Cakra, identified with the

<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman was forbidden to use the
<div n="lb">Brahmaśiras astra on any occasion whatso-
<div n="lb">ever; so he wanted to exchange Brahmaśiras
<div n="lb">for Kṛṣṇa's Sudarśana; Kṛṣṇa allowed Aśva-
<div n="lb">tthāman to choose any one of his missiles,
<div n="lb">including the Cakra, which he felt he could
<div n="lb">wield and use in the battle; Aśvatthāman opted
<div n="lb">for the Cakra, and when allowed by Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">to take it, he first tried to pick it up with his
<div n="lb">left hand; failing to move it, he tried his right
<div n="lb">hand; when he could not move the Cakra
<div n="lb">even with his right hand, he used all his might
<div n="lb">(i. e. probably used both his hands together);
<div n="lb">having failed in this attempt too, Aśvatthāman
<div n="lb">in despair abandoned the attempt; Kṛṣṇa then
<div n="lb">told him that he had asked for something very
<div n="lb">unusual, for not even Arjuna, Pradyumna,
<div n="lb">(Bala)rāma, Gada, Sāmba, nor any one of
<div n="lb">the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes living in
<div n="lb">Dvārakā had asked for it; Kṛṣṇa, out of
<div n="lb">curiosity, asked Aśvatthāman whom he wanted
<div n="lb">to fight with equipped with Sudarśana; Aśva-
<div n="lb">tthāman admitted that he wanted to fight
<div n="lb">with Kṛṣṇa himself and become invincible;
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman realised that the Cakra would
<div n="lb">not leave Kṛṣṇa and hence he left Dvārakā

<div n="lb">without it 10. 12. 14-38. {@F.@} Its use:
<div n="lb">(1) In wars or events not related to the
<div n="lb">epic: (i) when Viṣṇu was distributing the
<div n="lb">{%amṛta%} among the gods, Rāhu cunningly
<div n="lb">managed to get it; as the {%amṛta%} had
<div n="lb">reached Rāhu's throat, Viṣṇu used the Cakra
<div n="lb">to cut off his head; when severed by the
<div n="lb">Cakra, the head fell on the ground and shook
<div n="lb">the earth 1. 17. 5-7; (ii) in the war that
<div n="lb">ensued between the gods and the demons
<div n="lb">after the above incident Nara and Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb">appeared on the scene; Viṣṇu (Narāyaṇa)
<div n="lb">then thought of his Sudarśana cakra; as soon
<div n="lb">as thought of, it arrived from the sky ({%tato%}
<div n="lb">{%'mbarāc cintitamātram āgatam%} 1. 17. 20);
<div n="lb">armed with it, Viṣṇu used it against the
<div n="lb">demons; it struck them again and again and
<div n="lb">cut off the Daityas to pieces in thousands;
<div n="lb">sometimes it licked the Dānavas and, over-
<div n="lb">powering them, cut them off; sometimes it
<div n="lb">burnt them like fire; hurled now in the sky
<div n="lb">and then on the ground it drunk their blood
<div n="lb">like a Piśāca; having heard that the Sudar-
<div n="lb">śana cakra was angry, the demons disappeared
<div n="lb">entering the earth and the ocean 1. 17. 18-28;
<div n="lb">(iii) in Kṛṣṇa's war with Śālva who was
<div n="lb">fighting from his Saubhapura, Kṛṣṇa released

<div n="lb">23. 30) and using the strength of his arm
<div n="lb">({%bhujavīryeṇa%} 3. 23. 31); Kṛṣṇa directed
<div n="lb">his Cakra to strike down with its might the
<div n="lb">Saubha and all the enemies living there; the
<div n="lb">missile cut into two the Saubha town in the
<div n="lb">middle as a saw might cut a pillar; after
<div n="lb">achieving its objective the missile returned to
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa's hand; Kṛṣṇa again shook it upwards
<div n="lb">with great speed and released it with the
<div n="lb">words: “(now) for Śālva” ({%punaś cod-%}
[Page155-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">{%dhūya vegena śālvāyety aham abruvam%} 3. 23.

<div n="lb">who was then wielding a heavy {%gadā,%} and
<div n="lb">then it blazed with its lustre 3. 23. 28-36;
<div n="lb">(2) In wars or events related to the epic:
<div n="lb">(1) at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">killed many hosts of Daityas and Dānavas
<div n="lb">with his Cakra; many others, were blown
<div n="lb">away by the speed of the Cakra ({%cakra-%}
<div n="lb">{%vegeritāḥ%}) 1. 218. 26-27; in this incident
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa released his Cakra on animals and
<div n="lb">other beings ({%tathānyā bhūtajātayaḥ%} 1. 219.
<div n="lb">2) so that these, along with the Dānavas and
<div n="lb">the night-stalkers ({%sadānavaniśācarāḥ%} 1. 219.
<div n="lb">4) were cut into pieces by hundreds and they
<div n="lb">fell into the fire; the Rākṣasas, cut by the
<div n="lb">Cakra of Kṛṣṇa, looked like evening clouds;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa moved there like the god of Death kill-
<div n="lb">ing by thousands Piśācas, birds, serpents and
<div n="lb">animals with his Cakra; the Cakra, repeatedly
<div n="lb">hurled, killed many beings and returned to
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa's hand 1. 219. 2-7; if the Rākṣasas,
<div n="lb">Dānavas and serpents tried to escape to-
<div n="lb">gether ({%ekāyanagatāḥ saṅghībhūtāḥ%} Nī. on
<div n="lb">1. 228. 34 Bom. Ed.) even then Kṛṣṇa killed
<div n="lb">them and they fell into the flaming fire 1. 219.
<div n="lb">30-31; Kṛṣṇa saw Asura Maya fleeing from
<div n="lb">the house of Takṣaka and when Agni showed

<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa took up his discuss ({%rathāṅgam%}) with
<div n="lb">a view to killing Bhīṣma; raising his Cakra he
[Page156-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">jumped down from the chariot and proceeded

<div n="lb">lotus-like and having a beautiful nave, shone
<div n="lb">like the primeval lotus ({%ādipadma%}) rising
<div n="lb">from the navel of Nārāyaṇa; seeing Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">equipped with Cakra all beings cried aloud
<div n="lb">thinking that that was the end of the Kurus;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa, holding the Cakra and jumping along,
<div n="lb">looked as if he was revolving the world, or
<div n="lb">he looked like the god of Death in the form of

<div n="lb">rushing towards him with Cakra in hand,
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma invited him from his chariot to put
<div n="lb">an end to his life; when Arjuna, coming
<div n="lb">from behind, assured Kṛṣṇa that he would

<div n="lb">the discuss, mounted the chariot 6. 55. 83,
<div n="lb">86-87, 89-94, 100-101; (3) Apprehending
<div n="lb">that Arjuna might not be able to fulfil his vow
<div n="lb">to kill Jayadratha before sunset, Kṛṣṇa thought
<div n="lb">that his intervention in the war might become
<div n="lb">necessary and he therefore asked Dāruka, his
<div n="lb">charioteer, to keep his chariot ready with all
<div n="lb">the missiles in it, including Cakra, so that he
<div n="lb">would destroy the enemy's army with it 7.
