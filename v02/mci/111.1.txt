{@Garuḍa@}¦, {@Garutmant, Tārkṣya, Vaina-@}
<div n="lb">{@teya, Suparṇa@} m.: A mythical bird.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73
<div n="lb">the origin is narrated in the Āstīkaparvan;
<div n="lb">mind-born ({%saṃkalpaja%}) son of Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb">Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vaina-
<div n="lb">teya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatā-
<div n="lb">sūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39;
<div n="lb">1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two
<div n="lb">eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot ({%sopas-%}
<div n="lb">{%veda bhāṇḍa%}) for over a thousand years; as
<div n="lb">advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not
<div n="lb">break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20;
<div n="lb">when the proper time came Garuḍa came out
<div n="lb">of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as
<div n="lb">soon as born he left the mother and flew up
<div n="lb">in the sky, from there to seek his destined
<div n="lb">food (serpents, hence {%pannagasūdana%}) 1. 14.
<div n="lb">22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among
<div n="lb">the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62;
<div n="lb">(1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the
<div n="lb">penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once
<div n="lb">Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they
<div n="lb">offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra
<div n="lb">for gods who would be a hundred times more
<div n="lb">powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27.
[Page015-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajā-
<div n="lb">pati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that
<div n="lb">the one to be born as a result of their
<div n="lb">sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1.
<div n="lb">27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated
<div n="lb">as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a
<div n="lb">boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by
<div n="lb">their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma
<div n="lb">13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa
<div n="lb">was of big size ({%mahākāyaḥ%}), having
<div n="lb">blazing lustre and looking like a mass of
<div n="lb">kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought
<div n="lb">him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni
<div n="lb">not to burn the people; they were informed
<div n="lb">by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa,
<div n="lb">Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and
<div n="lb">sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa with-
<div n="lb">drew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14. {@B.@} Progeny:
<div n="lb">Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya)
<div n="lb">Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the
<div n="lb">lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of
<div n="lb">Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1;
<div n="lb">these six are thus the founders of the {%vinatā-%}
<div n="lb">{%kula%} 5. 99. 3. {@C.@} Eminence: Garuḍa com-
<div n="lb">pared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said
<div n="lb">that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13.
<div n="lb">14. 158; as the best among the birds he was
<div n="lb">counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6.
<div n="lb">32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the
<div n="lb">birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought
<div n="lb">highly of other birds whenever he con-
<div n="lb">fronted them 6. 4. 34. {@D.@} Bringer of {%amṛta%}
<div n="lb">(Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa
<div n="lb">approached his mother who, as the slave of
<div n="lb">Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean;
<div n="lb">at her instance Vainateya carried on his
<div n="lb">back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted
<div n="lb">due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when
<div n="lb">revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa
<div n="lb">carried them to a beautiful forest in an island,
<div n="lb">and from there to another island 1. 23. 1,
[Page016-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do
<div n="lb">whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing
<div n="lb">the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked
<div n="lb">serpents how his mother could be freed from
<div n="lb">slavery; serpents asked him to get {%amṛta%} for
<div n="lb">them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his
<div n="lb">expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he
<div n="lb">might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the
<div n="lb">Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him
<div n="lb">never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told
<div n="lb">Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the
<div n="lb">time of his departure he was blessed by
<div n="lb">Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak
<div n="lb">and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14;
<div n="lb">a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got
<div n="lb">into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa
<div n="lb">opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his
<div n="lb">wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he
<div n="lb">met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he
<div n="lb">was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; {%amṛta%}
<div n="lb">1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might
<div n="lb">eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka,
<div n="lb">(an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise),
<div n="lb">both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25.
<div n="lb">7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and
<div n="lb">the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived
<div n="lb">in the south and used to fight with each other)
<div n="lb">with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and
<div n="lb">sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch
<div n="lb">gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25.
<div n="lb">27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to
<div n="lb">save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya
<div n="lb">1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew
<div n="lb">around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went
<div n="lb">to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana
<div n="lb">mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas
<div n="lb">that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest
<div n="lb">of the living beings; they left the branch;
<div n="lb">Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked
<div n="lb">Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from
[Page016-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch;
<div n="lb">as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited
<div n="lb">mountain covered with snow and there ate the
<div n="lb">elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as
<div n="lb">Garuḍa drew near the place of {%amṛta,%}
<div n="lb">there were bad omens for gods; when Indra
<div n="lb">enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that
<div n="lb">Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26.
<div n="lb">36-37 (called also {%amṛta%} 1. 26. 38); Bṛhas-
<div n="lb">pati told the gods that Garuḍa was of in-
<div n="lb">comparable strength and would achieve what
<div n="lb">was most difficult to achieve ({%asādhyam api%}
<div n="lb">{%sādhayet%}) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart
<div n="lb">1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28.
<div n="lb">20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of
<div n="lb">Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were
<div n="lb">protecting {%amṛta%} (1. 28. 6), an with birds
<div n="lb">({%pakṣin%}) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others;
<div n="lb">he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought
<div n="lb">with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after
<div n="lb">the fight Garuḍa saw {%amṛta%} surrounded
<div n="lb">by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety
<div n="lb">times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers,
<div n="lb">poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter
<div n="lb">the fire he became small in size 1. 28.
<div n="lb">22-25; near the {%amṛta%} he saw a wheel
<div n="lb">of iron ({%ayasmaya%}), of sharp edge, which
<div n="lb">was a device ({%yantra%}) created by gods to
<div n="lb">cut down those who might try to steal
<div n="lb">Soma; as he entered through the spokes
<div n="lb">of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poi-
<div n="lb">son in their eyes ({%cakṣurviṣau%}), guard-
<div n="lb">ing {%amṛta;%} anyone seen by them would be
<div n="lb">reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes
<div n="lb">with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya)
<div n="lb">snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with
<div n="lb">the force of his speed he uprooted ({%unmath-%})
<div n="lb">the {%yantra%} 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not
<div n="lb">taste the {%amṛta%} but asked a boon from Viṣṇu
<div n="lb">that he should become undecaying and im-
<div n="lb">mortal without tasting {%amṛta%} 1. 29. 11, 14;
[Page017-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa,
<div n="lb">as he was taking away {%amṛta,%} with his {%vajra;%}
<div n="lb">to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from
<div n="lb">whose bones the {%vajra%} was fashioned, the {%vajra%}
<div n="lb">itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather
<div n="lb">from his wings, as though due to the stroke
<div n="lb">of {%vajra,%} but otherwise was not affected
<div n="lb">by the {%vajra%} 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather
<div n="lb">of excellent form all beings ({%sarvabhūtāni%})
<div n="lb">said “may this bird be Suparṇa” ({%surūpaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%patram ālakṣya suparṇo 'yaṃ bhavatv iti%})
<div n="lb">1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship,
<div n="lb">and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1
<div n="lb">(Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's
<div n="lb">birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1.
<div n="lb">27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return
<div n="lb">Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of
<div n="lb">taking it away; both hatched a plan—
<div n="lb">Indra was to take away {%amṛta%} once Garuḍa
<div n="lb">had placed it before the serpents and freed his
<div n="lb">mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra
<div n="lb">granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose ser-
<div n="lb">pents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his
<div n="lb">epithets like {%pannagāśana%} 2. 22. 23; 5. 110.

<div n="lb">placed it for them on the {%kuśa%} grass; he asked
<div n="lb">them to take it after they had bathed and
<div n="lb">become auspicious ({%maṅgalasaṃyuktāḥ%}); he
<div n="lb">asked serpents to free his mother from slavery
<div n="lb">from that day; the serpents agreed and went
<div n="lb">to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to
<div n="lb">roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the for-
<div n="lb">est and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa,
<div n="lb">Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that

<div n="lb">mitra to give him as {%dakṣiṇā%} eight hundred
<div n="lb">moon-like white horses, each having a black ear
<div n="lb">on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to
<div n="lb">procure these, Gālava desired to take recourse
<div n="lb">to Viṣṇu; just then Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja),
<div n="lb">the friend of Gālava, appeared before him and
<div n="lb">offered to take him to any place 5. 105.
<div n="lb">14-19; Suparṇa described to Gālava the four
<div n="lb">directions 5. Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava

<div n="lb">Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked
<div n="lb">Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to

<div n="lb">him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further
<div n="lb">but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15;

<div n="lb">giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17;
<div n="lb">Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with

<div n="lb">mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāh-
<div n="lb">maṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her
[Page018-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found
<div n="lb">himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of
<div n="lb">wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was re-
<div n="lb">duced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī
<div n="lb">and had planned to take her away from that
<div n="lb">place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī
<div n="lb">relented and told Garuḍa that he would

<div n="lb">Gālava without the horses he had asked for,
<div n="lb">he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya
<div n="lb">and said he would further wait for a period
<div n="lb">of the same duration as before; Suparṇa,
<div n="lb">having heard what Viśvāmitra had said,
