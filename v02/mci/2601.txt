<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to
<div n="lb">get back the kingdom by waging war
<div n="lb">with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count
<div n="lb">on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified
<div n="lb">with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him

<div n="lb">3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it
[Page916-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their
<div n="lb">share of kingdom before war broke out
<div n="lb">in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5.
<div n="lb">56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upa-

<div n="lb">told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the

<div n="lb">and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that
<div n="lb">Arjuna wanted him to convey to the
<div n="lb">Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana
<div n="lb">would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb">dyumna fighting at the head of the army

[Page916-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in
<div n="lb">astrology had predicted the destruction of
<div n="lb">Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37,

<div n="lb">who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas

<div n="lb">5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the
