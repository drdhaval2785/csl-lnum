<div n="lb">by the Kuntalas, Daśārṇas, Māgadhas and
<div n="lb">many others; Śakuni with his army, as
<div n="lb">also the Gāndhāras, Sindhusauvīras, the

<div n="lb">protect him; Duryodhana, with his brothers,
<div n="lb">and the Aśvātakas, the Vikarṇas, the Śar-

<div n="lb">11-20; (2) Apparently the Kaliṅga king,
<div n="lb">when asked by Duryodhana to protect Droṇa
<div n="lb">and attack Bhīma (6. 49. 37, 38; 6. 50. 1,
<div n="lb">3 ff.), had arranged his army in the Mahā-
<div n="lb">vyūha way ({%mahāvyūhaḥ kaliṅgānām%} 6. 50.
<div n="lb">113); in that vyūha many elephants, horse-
<div n="lb">men, and chariot fighters took part ({%nāgā-%}
<div n="lb">{%śvarathasaṃkulaḥ%}); Bhīma, by himself,

<div n="lb">arranged the Kaurava army according to the

<div n="lb">83. 5, 13, 15; it looked like an ocean ({%sāgara-%}
<div n="lb">{%pratima%}) 6. 83. 5, ({%sāgaropama%}) 6. 83. 16;
<div n="lb">the vyūha was led by Bhīṣma, accompanied
<div n="lb">by the Mālavas, Dākṣiṇātyas, and the Āvan-
[Page128-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">tyas; he was followed by Droṇa, accompa-
<div n="lb">nied by Pulindas, Pāradas, Kṣudrakas, and
<div n="lb">the Mālavas; Droṇa was followed by Bhaga-
<div n="lb">datta, accompanied by the Māgadhas, the
<div n="lb">Kaliṅgas, and the Piśācas; behind him was
<div n="lb">Bṛhadbala of the Kosala country, accompa-
<div n="lb">nied by the Mekalas, the Traipuras, and the
<div n="lb">Cicchilas; then came Trigarta (Suśarman),
<div n="lb">the ruler of Prasthalas accompanied by many
<div n="lb">Kāṃbojas and the Yavanas in thousands;
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman followed Trigarta; behind
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman marched Duryodhana surround-
<div n="lb">ed by his brothers; Kṛpa followed Duryo-
<div n="lb">dhana 6. 83. 6-13; (4) The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">arranged their army in the Mahāvyūha way
<div n="lb">(6. 95. 38) on the ninth day of the war
<div n="lb">to counter the Sarvatobhadravyūha of the
<div n="lb">Kauravas (6. 95. 26); in the forefront of
<div n="lb">this vyūha stood Bhīmasena (6. 95. 40),
<div n="lb">along with Yudhiṣṭhira, Nakula and Saha-
<div n="lb">deva; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa and Sātyaki
<div n="lb">apparently followed them; they seem to have
<div n="lb">been followed by Śikhaṇḍin, Vijaya (Arjuna),
<div n="lb">the Rākṣasa Ghaṭotkaca, Cekitāna and Kunti-
<div n="lb">bhoja, all of them encircled by large armies;
<div n="lb">the rear seems to have been made up by
<div n="lb">Abhimanyu, Drupada, and five Kekaya
<div n="lb">brothers (6. 95. 34-38); (but Arjuna had
<div n="lb">advised Dhṛṣṭadyumna to see that Śikhaṇḍin
<div n="lb">confronted Bhīṣma and that he would pro-
<div n="lb">tect Śikhaṇḍin ({%śikhaṇḍinaṃ naravyāghra%}

<div n="lb">6. 95. 25; according to Duryodhana's infor-
<div n="lb">mation, in that position Yudhāmanyu would
<div n="lb">guard the left wheel of Arjuna and Utta-
<div n="lb">maujas the right wheel 6. 95. 21).
