{@Stambamitra@}¦ m.: Name of one of the
<div n="lb">four Śārṅgaka birds who survived the Khāṇ-
<div n="lb">ḍava fire 1. 219. 40; 1. 220. 1-4.
<div n="P">The ascetic Mandapāla turned into a
<div n="lb">Śārṅgaka bird had four sons from the Śārṅ-
<div n="lb">gikā Jaritā; Mandapāla left them when they
<div n="lb">were still in the eggs, but their mother did
<div n="lb">not desert them; she reared them as birds
<div n="lb">({%svavṛtyā%} 1. 220. 19) after they were born;
<div n="lb">they all were seers ({%ṛṣi%}), knowers of Brah-
<div n="lb">man, full of lustre and strong; they were able
<div n="lb">speakers 1. 220. 17; 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 3;
<div n="lb">when the fire began to burn the Khāṇḍava
<div n="lb">forest Mandapāla praised Agni and secured
[Page079-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">a promise from him not to burn his young ones
<div n="lb">1. 220. 5, 16-32; 1. 223. 22-23; 1. 224. 9;
<div n="lb">1. 225. 1; Stambamitra's father expected him
<div n="lb">to practise austerities when he grew up 1. 221.
<div n="lb">9; when the forest fire broke out the Śārṅgaka
<div n="lb">young ones had not developed wings and feet
<div n="lb">({%abarhāś caraṇair hīnāḥ%} 1. 221. 4, 18); as
<div n="lb">the fire drew near they advised their mother
<div n="lb">to abandon them and fly to a safe place;
<div n="lb">she, on her part, advised them to creep into
<div n="lb">the hole of a mouse to save themselves from
<div n="lb">fire; they did not agree since they were
<div n="lb">afraid of the mouse; when the young ones
<div n="lb">were not prepared to enter the hole even
<div n="lb">when assured by their mother that the mouse
<div n="lb">was taken away by a falcon, she left them to
<div n="lb">their fate 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-16; as the
<div n="lb">fire drew close the three younger Śārṅgaka
<div n="lb">birds entreated the eldest one, Jarṅāri, to do
<div n="lb">something to rescue them; on that occasion
<div n="lb">Stambamitra said to his brother: “The eldest
<div n="lb">is the protection, the eldest releases from
<div n="lb">difficulty; if the eldest does not know (what
<div n="lb">to do), what shall the younger one do ?”
<div n="lb">(1. 223. 4); when the young Śārṅgaka birds
<div n="lb">began to praise god fire in turns, Stamba-
<div n="lb">mitra, when his turn arrived, said: “Oh
<div n="lb">Agni, you are the only one, and this whole
<div n="lb">world stands in you; you hold the beings
<div n="lb">and you bear the world; you carry the ob-
<div n="lb">lation, and wise men worship you as one and
<div n="lb">as manifold; after creating these worlds,
<div n="lb">you digest them when time arrives; you are
<div n="lb">the source of this world and its mainstay;
<div n="lb">oh lord of the world, you digest the food
<div n="lb">eaten by the living beings” (1. 223. 12-15);
<div n="lb">when the fire subsided the mother of the
<div n="lb">Śarṅgaka birds returned to them 1. 224. 17;
<div n="lb">sage Mandapāla also was anxious about the
<div n="lb">safety of Stambamitra and the rest and he
[Page080-a+ 38]
<div n="lb">returned to them; he was not greeted by the
<div n="lb">children and they did not speak to him; he
<div n="lb">enquired who was the eldest, who the next,
<div n="lb">who the middle one and who the youngest;
<div n="lb">when be assured them that he had already
<div n="lb">secured their safety from god Fire they were
<div n="lb">reconciled to him; Mandapāla left the region
<div n="lb">of the Khāṇḍava forest and went elsewhere
<div n="lb">with his wife and children 1. 224. 6, 20-22;
<div n="lb">1. 225. 1-4.
