{@Śukra<sup>1</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of the planet Venus,
<div n="lb">also called {@Bhārgava@} (7. 143. 30).
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Description: lustrous ({%tejasvin%})
<div n="lb">12. 278. 5. {@B.@} History: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">once asked Bhīṣma how Uśanas of im-
<div n="lb">perishable lustre became Śukra and how he
<div n="lb">acquired prosperity ({%kathaṃ cāpy uśanā%}
<div n="lb">{%prāpa śuktratvam amaradyutiḥ/ṛddhiṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%sa ca kathaṃ prāptaḥ%}) 12. 278. 4 (Nī.,
<div n="lb">however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5 explains
<div n="lb">{%śukratvaṃ as śukrotpannatvam,%} cf. {%sa viniṣ-%}
<div n="lb">{%kramya śiśnena śukratvam abhipedivān%} 12.
<div n="lb">278. 32); Yudhiṣṭhira also asked Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">why does Śukra not move through the middle
<div n="lb">of the sky ({%na yāti ca sa tejasvī madhyena%}
<div n="lb">{%nabhasaḥ katham%}) 12. 278. 5; 12. 278. 32
<div n="lb">(Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5:
<div n="lb">{%tasya ākāśagatiḥ kutaḥ kuṇṭhitety arthaḥ/%}
<div n="lb">{%saptarṣivad dvīrūpeṇa sthitasya śukrasya%}
<div n="lb">{%bhūsthamūrtiviṣayaka evāyaṃ praśno na%}
<div n="lb">{%bhacakrasthamūrtiviṣayaḥ tena yathā bhau-%}

<div n="lb">{%mānāṃ vasiṣṭhādīnāṃ svarge 'pi gatir asti%}
<div n="lb">{%naivaṃ bhaumasya śukrasyāstīti gamyate/%});
<div n="lb">(2) Parāśara told Janaka that Uśanas be-
<div n="lb">came Śukra by propitiating Devadeva (Śiva);
<div n="lb">and by praising Devī (Umā) he, covered
<div n="lb">with lustre, delights in the sky ({%gataḥ%}
<div n="lb">{%śukratvam uśanā devadevaprasādanāt/%}
<div n="lb">{%devīṃ stutvā tu gagane modate tejasā vṛtaḥ%})
<div n="lb">12. 281. 14 (a reference to 12. 278. 13-37);
<div n="lb">(3) Planet Śukra is the son of Kavi
<div n="lb">({%śukraḥ kavisuto grahaḥ%}) 1. 60. 40 (Nī.
<div n="lb">on Bom. Ed. 1. 66. 42: {%śukro graha-%}
<div n="lb">{%tvād eva lokānāṃ prāṇayātrāyāṃ varṣā-%}
<div n="lb">{%varṣādikārye niyuktaḥ%}) {@C.@} Importance:
<div n="lb">(1) Śukra, along with other planets, visits
<div n="lb">the {%sabhā%} of Brahman 2. 11. 20; (2) finds
<div n="lb">place in the Daivatavaṃśa 13. 151. 12.
<div n="lb">{@D.@} Name of Sūrya: Śukra appears as the 23rd
<div n="lb">name in the list of the 108 names of Sūrya
<div n="lb">taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 19.
<div n="lb">{@E.@} Auspicious: (1) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">heard that the planet Śukra and Sūrya
<div n="lb">both together were favourable to the sons
<div n="lb">of Kuntī for their victory in war he did
<div n="lb">not hope to win ({%yadāśrauṣaṃ śukra-%}
<div n="lb">{%sūryau ca yuktau kaunteyānām anulomau%}
<div n="lb">{%jayāya … tadā nāsaṃse vijayāya saṃjaya//%})
<div n="lb">1. 1. 129; (2) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">that in wars, victory was on that side for
<div n="lb">which wind, Sūrya and the planet Śukra were
<div n="lb">favourable; if they all were simultaneously
<div n="lb">present, each time the former was stronger
<div n="lb">than the latter ({%yato vāyur yataḥ sūryo%}
<div n="lb">{%yataḥ śukras tato jayaḥ/pūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%jyāya eṣāṃ saṃnipāte yudhiṣṭhira%} 12. 101.
<div n="lb">17. {@F.@} Bad effect: While Śukra is in
<div n="lb">conjunction with the two Proṣṭhapadās it has
<div n="lb">wealth (as Kubera, the lord of riches, also
<div n="lb">has); Śukra in that position takes away from
<div n="lb">men whatever they have earned according to
[Page272-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">their desires 5. 112. 3 (for citation and Nī.'s
<div n="lb">comm. see {@Pūrvā Bhādrapadā@}); (for Śukra
<div n="lb">as a great sage and perfect in {%yoga%} depriv-
<div n="lb">ing also Kubera of his wealth see 12. 278.
<div n="lb">7-9). {@G.@} Omens: Among the bad omens
<div n="lb">noticed by the Vyāsa before the war one was
<div n="lb">related to Śukra's ascending the Pūrva
<div n="lb">Proṣṭhapada and then, after going over to the
<div n="lb">Uttara Proṣṭhapada, both looking back at
<div n="lb">the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada 6. 3. 14 (for citation
<div n="lb">see {@Uttarā Bhādrapadā@}). {@H.@} Similes:
<div n="lb">(1) The battle between Drupada and Jaya-
<div n="lb">dratha, delightful to the spectators ({%īkṣitṛ-%}
<div n="lb">{%prītijananam%}), was like the one between
<div n="lb">Śukra and Aṅgāraka 6. 43. 54; (2) Droṇa
<div n="lb">and Arjuna met in battle like Budha and
<div n="lb">Śukra in the sky ({%nabhastale%}) 6. 97. 57;
<div n="lb">(3) The battle between Prativindhya and
<div n="lb">Duḥśāsana was like the one between Budha
<div n="lb">and Bhārgava (Śukra) in a cloudless sky
<div n="lb">({%vyapetajalade vyomni%}) 7. 143. 30; (4)
<div n="lb">Arjuna, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki by his
<div n="lb">side in the chariot, looked like the darkness-
<div n="lb">destroying Śaśin with Budha and Śukra 7.
<div n="lb">60. 20. [For {@Śukra@} also see Section 1. 7]
