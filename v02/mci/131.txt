{@Jaritā@}¦ f.: A female {%Śārṅga%} bird
<div n="lb">({%śārṅgikā, śārṅgī%} 1. 220. 16; 1. 222. 16).
<div n="P">Lived in the Khāṇḍava forest 1. 220. 19;
<div n="lb">sage Mandapāla turned himself into a {%Śārṅga%}
<div n="lb">bird and became united with Jaritā; he begot on
<div n="lb">her four sons 1. 220. 16-17; when Mandapāla
<div n="lb">left his sons, still in the form of eggs, and went
<div n="lb">to Lapitā, another {%Śārṅga%} female, Jaritā was
<div n="lb">very much worried out of her affection for the
<div n="lb">young ones 1. 220. 17-18; she did not aban-
<div n="lb">don the eggs and when they were hatched, she
<div n="lb">reared them as a bird would do ({%svavṛtyā%})
<div n="lb">1. 220. 19; when the Khāṇḍava forest was
<div n="lb">on fire she was distressed and lamented for her
<div n="lb">sons who had then not developed feathers, or
<div n="lb">feet; she did not have strength enough to fly
<div n="lb">to a safe place taking all the young ones with
<div n="lb">her; she did not know whom to abandon and
<div n="lb">whom not; she therefore told her children that
<div n="lb">she would cover them under her wings and
<div n="lb">die with them 1. 221. 1-7; but the young ones
<div n="lb">suggested to her to abandon them and save her-
<div n="lb">self from fire 1. 221. 12; she then advised them
<div n="lb">to enter the hole of a mouse under a tree which
<div n="lb">she would cover with earth; when the fire sub-
<div n="lb">sided she would return and remove the earth
<div n="lb">1. 221. 15-17; the young ones hesitated for the
<div n="lb">fear of the mouse; Jaritā tried to remove the
[Page024-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">fear by telling them that the mouse had been
<div n="lb">already picked up by a hawk ({%śyena%}); the
<div n="lb">young ones were still sceptical; she once again
<div n="lb">told them that when the hawk took the mouse
<div n="lb">she flew behind the hawk and blessed him to
<div n="lb">be golden when he went to heaven for he had
<div n="lb">taken off the enemy of the birds 1. 222. 5-8;
<div n="lb">the young birds remained firm in their resolve
<div n="lb">not to enter the hole and asked their mother to
<div n="lb">fly away to a safe place; Jaritā then left her
<div n="lb">sons to their fate and flew away 1. 222. 10-
<div n="lb">16; when the fire had moved away from that
<div n="lb">place Jaritā, coveting her sons, returned and
<div n="lb">seeing them safe tears came to her eyes again
<div n="lb">and again; she could not believe that they
<div n="lb">were safe 1. 224. 17-19; Mandapāla also
<div n="lb">remembered Jaritā and his sons and wondered
<div n="lb">what might have happened to them in the fire
<div n="lb">1. 224. 3-5; Lapitā, the other {%Śārṅgikā,%} en-
<div n="lb">vious of Jaritā asked Mandapāla to go to her
<div n="lb">for whom he was in anguish 1. 224. 11-13;
<div n="lb">Mandapāla met Jaritā and his sons, but the
<div n="lb">sons would not talk to him; Jaritā, too,
<div n="lb">asked Mandapāla what business he had with
<div n="lb">the young birds and told him to return to the
<div n="lb">young and sweet smiling Lapitā 1. 224. 21-
<div n="lb">25; Mandapāla blamed Jaritā for her distrust
<div n="lb">1. 224. 26-31, but also acknowledged her being
<div n="lb">conversant with {%dharma (dharmajñatā)%}
<div n="lb">1. 225. 2; when all were reconciled Manda-
<div n="lb">pāla took his wife ({%bhāryā%}) Jaritā and the
<div n="lb">sons with him and left for another country
<div n="lb">1. 225. 4.
