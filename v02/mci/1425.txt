<div n="lb">Aṅgiras and others who came together at
<div n="lb">Prabhāsa thought of going on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
<div n="lb">from there; (3) Soma was cursed by
<div n="lb">Dakṣa; as a result he was emaciated and could
<div n="lb">not shine; Dakṣa Prajāpati advised him to
<div n="lb">go to the {%tīrtha%} of Sarasvatī (i. e. Prabhāsa)
<div n="lb">and emerge from there after taking a bath;
<div n="lb">when Soma did this he could wax again; but
<div n="lb">for one half of the month he would wane;
<div n="lb">so Soma went to Prabhāsa and emerged
<div n="lb">after bath on the new moon day; he could
<div n="lb">illuminate the worlds; the gods then reached
<div n="lb">Prabhāsa and, in the company of Soma,
<div n="lb">met Dakṣa; this is why Prabhāsa became
<div n="lb">the most excellent of all the {%tīrthas (pra-%}
