<div n="lb">Part in the epic war: Arjuna told Vyāsa,
<div n="lb">after the death of Droṇa, that when on the
<div n="lb">battle-field he shot arrows at his enemies he
<div n="lb">saw an excellent person ({%puruṣottama%}) of

<div n="lb">front of him with his raised burning Śūla; the
<div n="lb">person did not touch the ground with his feet
<div n="lb">and never released the Śula, but thousands of
<div n="lb">Śūlas fell out from it; the direction in which
<div n="lb">the excellent person moved, Arjuna's enemies
<div n="lb">were destroyed; thus, actually the excellent
<div n="lb">person first burnt Arjuna's enemies and Arjuna
<div n="lb">burnt them afterwards, but people thought
<div n="lb">Arjuna did it; Vyāsa told Arjuna that the
<div n="lb">excellent person was none else but Śaṅkara
