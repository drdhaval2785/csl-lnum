{@Kuṇḍadhāra@}¦ m.: Name of a cloud.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Description: An attendant of gods
<div n="lb">({%devānucara%}) 12. 263. 6; lustrous ({%kuṇḍa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhārasya tejasā%}) 12. 263. 13; of great
<div n="lb">lustre ({%mahādyuti%}) 12. 263. 17, 20; of great
<div n="lb">fame ({%mahāyaśas%}) 12. 263. 27; magnanim-
<div n="lb">ous ({%mahātman%}) 12. 263. 7. {@B.@} Kuṇḍa-
<div n="lb">dhāra figures in an ancient narrative
<div n="lb">({%itihāsaṃ purātanam%}) told by Bhīṣma to
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his question:
<div n="lb">What is most profitable among the three
<div n="lb">Puruṣārthas viz. {%dharma, artha%} and {%kāma%}
<div n="lb">(2. 263. 1-2); in the narrative, Kuṇḍadhāra
<div n="lb">obliges a Brāhmaṇa due to affection for
<div n="lb">his devotee ({%kuṇḍadhāreṇa yat prītyā%}
<div n="lb">{%bhaktāyopakṛtaṃ purā%}) 12. 263. 2-55;
<div n="lb">the narrative runs as follows: A certain
<div n="lb">poor Brāhmaṇa desired to obtain wealth
<div n="lb">in order to perform a sacrifice; he therefore
<div n="lb">worshipped many deities but did not get
<div n="lb">wealth; he then wondered which could be
<div n="lb">that one deity which would show him favour
[Page936-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">quickly; he then saw standing near him
<div n="lb">the cloud Kuṇḍadhāra ({%jaladharaṃ kuṇḍa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhāraṃ%} st. 6) who appeared before him
<div n="lb">assuming an agreeable form ({%saumyena%}
<div n="lb">{%vapuṣā%} st. 6); the Brāhmaṇa felt assured
<div n="lb">by Kuṇḍadhāra's form and felt that he
<div n="lb">would definitely give him ample wealth;
<div n="lb">the Brāhmaṇa became his devotee and
<div n="lb">worshipped Kuṇḍadhāra with incenses,
<div n="lb">perfumes, garlands and oblations ({%tato%}
<div n="lb">{%dhūpaiś ca gandhaiś ca mālyair uccāvacair%}
<div n="lb">{%api/balibhiś cāpi … ,%} st. 9); the cloud,
<div n="lb">satisfied, told the Brāhmaṇa that there were
<div n="lb">expiations for the sins committed due to
<div n="lb">killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, theft,
<div n="lb">breaking a vow, but there was no expiation
<div n="lb">for the sin of ungratefulness ({%kṛtaghne%}
<div n="lb">{%nāsti niṣkṛtiḥ%} st. 11); {%adharma%} was the
<div n="lb">child of craving, anger of envy, greed of
<div n="lb">insult ({%nikṛtyāḥ%}), and that an ungrateful
<div n="lb">person did not deserve progeny ({%kṛtaghno%}
<div n="lb">{%nārhati prajām%} st. 12); then the Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb">lying on the {%kuśa%} grass, due to the lustre
<div n="lb">({%tejas%}) of Kuṇḍadhāra, saw in a dream
<div n="lb">({%nidarśanam apaśyata%} st. 14), Maṇibhadra
<div n="lb">distributing kingdoms and wealth as desir-
<div n="lb">ed by gods ({%maṇibhadraṃ vyādiśantam … /%}
<div n="lb">{%tatra devāḥ prayacchanti rājyāni ca%}
<div n="lb">{%dhanāni ca%} st. 15-16); Kuṇḍadhāra fell
<div n="lb">at the feet of Maṇibhadra; Maṇibhadra, at
<div n="lb">the instance of gods, asked Kuṇḍadhāra
<div n="lb">what he desired; Kuṇḍadhāra replied that if
<div n="lb">the gods were satisfied with him they should
<div n="lb">show that kind of favour to the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">which would lead him to happiness ({%asyā-%}
<div n="lb">{%nugraham icchāmi kṛtaṃ kiṃcit sukho-%}
<div n="lb">{%dayam%} st. 19); again, at the instance of
<div n="lb">the gods, Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra
<div n="lb">that he was willing to give the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">as much wealth as desired by him; Kuṇḍa-
[Page936-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">dhāra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth)
<div n="lb">was fickle, decided to fix the Brāhmaṇa's
<div n="lb">mind on practising austerities ({%vicārya%}
<div n="lb">{%kuṇḍadhāras tu mānuṣaṃ calam adhruvam/%}
<div n="lb">{%tapase matim ādhatta brāhmaṇasya yaśas-%}
<div n="lb">{%vinaḥ%}) 12. 263. 22; Kuṇḍadhāra therefore
<div n="lb">told Maṇibhadra that he would not seek
<div n="lb">wealth for the Brāhmaṇa, but that the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa be devoted to {%dharma;%} he desir-
<div n="lb">ed that the Brāhmaṇa should take delight
<div n="lb">in {%dharma%} and should live following the
<div n="lb">{%dharma (bhaved eṣa tu dhārmikaḥ/dharme%}
<div n="lb">{%'sya ramatāṃ buddhir dharmaṃ caivopa-%}
<div n="lb">{%jīvatu/)%} 12. 263. 25; when Maṇibhadra
<div n="lb">persisted on giving the Brāhmaṇa kingdom
<div n="lb">and various kinds of happiness since that
<div n="lb">was what one aspired to get by follow-
<div n="lb">ing {%dharma,%} Kuṇḍadhāra did not change
<div n="lb">his mind and wanted his Brāhmaṇa devotee
<div n="lb">to live following the {%dharma;%} the gods
<div n="lb">were pleased with him; Maṇibhadra told
<div n="lb">Kuṇḍadhāra that the gods were satisfied
<div n="lb">with him and that the Brāhmaṇa's mind
<div n="lb">would be fixed on {%dharma%} and that he would
<div n="lb">be a {%dharmātmā;%} Kuṇḍadhāra was delight-
<div n="lb">ed for having obtained what was desired in
<div n="lb">the form of a boon not easily obtained by
<div n="lb">others; the Brāhmaṇa saw thin garments
<div n="lb">around him but his mind was not deluded;
<div n="lb">abandoning them, he went to the forest
<div n="lb">and practised severe austerities; he felt that
<div n="lb">if he so desired he could certainly give
<div n="lb">some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39);
<div n="lb">at that juncture Kuṇḍadhāra again appeared
<div n="lb">before the Brāhmaṇa due to his friendship
<div n="lb">with him and the severe austerities per-
<div n="lb">formed by him; the Brāhmaṇa, surprised,
<div n="lb">received him according to the rites; Kuṇḍa-
<div n="lb">dhāra told the Brāhmaṇa that he had now
<div n="lb">obtained the highest divine insight ({%divyaṃ%}
[Page937-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">{%te cakṣur uttamam%} 12. 263. 42) and by
<div n="lb">using it the Brāhmaṇa should see the ulti-
<div n="lb">mate fate of the kings and the worlds
<div n="lb">they would get; then the Brāhmaṇa by his
<div n="lb">divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in
<div n="lb">the hell; Kuṇḍadhāra wondered that if the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa, after worshipping him was to
<div n="lb">get unhappiness, what kind of favour had
<div n="lb">he done to him ? He therefore asked the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to
<div n="lb">realize that it was futile to run after various
<div n="lb">longings because the door to heaven was
<div n="lb">closed for such men ({%kāmān icched kathaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%naraḥ/svargadvāraṃ hi saṃruddhaṃ mānu-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ//%} 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear,
<div n="lb">arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder
<div n="lb">men from going to heaven ({%tato 'paśyat sa%}
<div n="lb">{%kāmaṃ ca krodhaṃ lobhaṃ bhayaṃ madam/%}
<div n="lb">{%nidrāṃ tandrīṃ tathālasyam āvṛtya puruṣān%}
<div n="lb">{%sthitān//%} 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again
<div n="lb">told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned
<div n="lb">before, stopped men from going to heaven;
<div n="lb">gods were afraid of such men; (these vices),
<div n="lb">as ordained by the gods, create obstacles
<div n="lb">all around ({%tathaiva devavacanād vighnaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%kurvanti sarvaśaḥ//%} 12. 263. 47); no one
<div n="lb">who was not permitted by gods could be
<div n="lb">virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his auste-
<div n="lb">rities, could confer kingdoms and wealth
<div n="lb">on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet
<div n="lb">of the cloud ({%toyadhāriṇe%} i. e. Kuṇḍa-
<div n="lb">dhāra) and told him that he had done a
<div n="lb">great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍa-
<div n="lb">dhāra to forgive him for having formerly
<div n="lb">envied him ({%purā te yad asūyitam%}) due
<div n="lb">to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra
<div n="lb">embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that
<div n="lb">he had forgiven him and then disappeared;
<div n="lb">the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the
[Page937-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">skies due to his austerities to which he was
<div n="lb">led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness
<div n="lb">he also gained what he wanted and the
<div n="lb">highest bliss ({%vihāyasā ca gamanaṃ tathā%}
<div n="lb">{%saṃkalpitārthatā/dharmāc chaktyā tathā%}
<div n="lb">{%yogād yā caiva paramā gatiḥ//%}) 12. 263.
