<div n="lb">{@A.@} History: Droṇa received the Nārā-
<div n="lb">yaṇāstra as a boon from Nārāyaṇa himself
<div n="lb">who appeared before him in the form of
<div n="lb">a Brāhmaṇa 7. 166. 43-44, 51; with its
<div n="lb">acquisition Droṇa became unrivalled in
<div n="lb">battle 7. 166. 45; given by Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb">also to Aśvatthāman 7. 166. 50; Aśva-
<div n="lb">tthāman knew how to release it ({%sakalyam%}
<div n="lb">for {%sakalpam ?%} See Cr. Notes 7, p. 1157
<div n="lb">on 166. 42; Nī. {%kalyaḥ prayogaḥ%} on Bom.
<div n="lb">Ed. 7. 195. 30), and how to withdraw it
<div n="lb">({%sanivartanam%}) 7. 166. 42 (but See Section
<div n="lb">{@C.@} 3 below); Nārāyaṇāstra known only to
<div n="lb">Droṇa and Aśvatthāman; it was not known
<div n="lb">even to Arjuna and the other Pāṇḍavas, nor
<div n="lb">to Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki, Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
<div n="lb">Śikhaṇḍin 7. 166. 2. 41-42. {@B.@} Descrip-
<div n="lb">tion: heavenly ({%divya%}) 1. 1. 145; 7. 166.
<div n="lb">60; great missile ({%mahāstra%}) 7. 166. 49;

<div n="lb">6. {@C.@} Use: (1) To be used with great
<div n="lb">circumspection: The missile was not to be
<div n="lb">employed in haste ({%na tv idaṃ sahasā%}
<div n="lb">{%brahman prayoktavyaṃ kathaṃcana%}); since
[Page110-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">it did not return without killing the enemy,
<div n="lb">it might kill, if used without circumspection,
<div n="lb">even one who did not deserve to be killed
<div n="lb">7. 166. 46-47; (2) Mode of release: To use
<div n="lb">it, Aśvatthāman touched water and produced
<div n="lb">the divine missile ({%tathoktvā droṇaputro 'pi%}
<div n="lb">{%tadopaspṛśya bhārata/prāduścakāra tad%}
<div n="lb">{%divyam astraṃ nārāyaṇaṃ tadā%}) 7. 166. 60;
<div n="lb">(3) Restrictions: It could be used only
<div n="lb">once, and it could not be withdrawn; hence
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman unable to employ it again when
<div n="lb">requested by Duryodhana to do so; if with-
<div n="lb">drawn the {%astra%} would kill the user 7. 171.
<div n="lb">24, 27, 28, 30. {@D.@} Effects: When em-
<div n="lb">ployed, the missile released powerful arrows
<div n="lb">({%? kṛśāśvatanayāḥ%}), as also sharp arrows
<div n="lb">which would fill the directions 7. 166. 38;
<div n="lb">it let loose many heavenly weapons ({%divyāni%}
<div n="lb">{%śastravarṣāṇi%}) and the employer (Aśvat-
<div n="lb">thāman) shone with lustre 7. 166. 50; the
<div n="lb">arrows released from it would hit the enemies
<div n="lb">as desired by the employer (Aśvatthāman);
<div n="lb">it would release rocks at will and iron-tipped
<div n="lb">arrows which would put the enemy to flight
<div n="lb">7. 166. 53-54; when Aśvatthāman produced
<div n="lb">the missile, thunderous winds carrying water-
<div n="lb">drops blew in cloud-less sky, the earth shook,
<div n="lb">and the ocean was agitated; rivers started
<div n="lb">flowing in the opposite direction; peaks of
<div n="lb">mountains were shattered; sun became turbid
<div n="lb">({%kaluṣa%}), and the gods, the demons, and
<div n="lb">the Gandharvas were frightened 7. 167. 1-5;
<div n="lb">arrows with shining tips appeared in thou-
<div n="lb">sands to cover the army of the enemy and
<div n="lb">fill the directions; (hot) iron balls ({%kārṣṇāya-%}
<div n="lb">{%samayā guḍāḥ%}) shining like celestial bodies,

<div n="lb">({%? hutāśadāḥ%}), and disks with sharp ends
<div n="lb">({%cakrāṇi kṣurāntāni%}), all these were produc-
<div n="lb">ed by the Nārāyaṇāstra (7. 170. 16-19); as the
[Page110-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍava warriors tried to resist the missile,
<div n="lb">it grew in strength 7. 170. 21; as a result,
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍava army was burnt and destroyed
<div n="lb">7. 170. 22-23; to combat it successfully
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa advised the warriors to lay down arms
<div n="lb">and get down from their chariots and mounts
<div n="lb">7. 170. 38-42; when all followed his in-
<div n="lb">struction, Bhīma wanted to resist the missile
<div n="lb">with arrows, mace, and the strength of his
<div n="lb">arms; as a consequence, the Nārāyaṇāstra
<div n="lb">grew in strength; since other warriors
<div n="lb">had laid down their arms the missile des-
<div n="lb">cended on Bhīma with all its strength 7.
<div n="lb">170. 45-46, 50-51, 57-60; seeing Bhīma
<div n="lb">surrounded by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Arjuna tried
<div n="lb">to protect him from the missile by using
<div n="lb">Vāruṇāstra; since this was of no avail,
<div n="lb">Arjuna and Vāsudeva left from their chariot,
<div n="lb">ran to Bhīma, and entered through the cover
<div n="lb">of lustre produced by the {%astra;%} since they
<div n="lb">had no weapons, the {%astra%} did not affect them
<div n="lb">(and also because of the effect of the Vāru-
<div n="lb">ṇāstra and the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna);
<div n="lb">Bhīma was forced down by Nara (Arjuna)
<div n="lb">and Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) from his chariot and
<div n="lb">forced to give up weapons; the Nārāyaṇāstra
<div n="lb">was then pacified; the quarters became clear
<div n="lb">and gentle winds blew; the birds and the
<div n="lb">animals felt assured 7. 171. 1, 3, 6, 10-14,
<div n="lb">20-22; if Vāsudeva had not shown the way
<div n="lb">to combat the Nārāyaṇāstra it would have
<div n="lb">meant death for the enemy (of the Kauravas)
<div n="lb">7. 171. 28; but the missile was rendered in-
<div n="lb">effective and the Pāṇḍavas freed from it 7.
<div n="lb">171. 33; 8. 1. 42. {@E.@} The means to pacify
<div n="lb">the Nārāyaṇāstra: When released, the missile
<div n="lb">must kill the enemy and only then it would
<div n="lb">subside; the other ways of pacifying it were to
<div n="lb">run away from it, to lay down the arms, to
<div n="lb">beg for life, and ask refuge ({%vadhaḥ saṃkhye%}
