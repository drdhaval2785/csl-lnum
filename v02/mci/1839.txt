<div n="lb">events: (1) An ascetic named Ṛṣabha
<div n="lb">once lived on this mountain (hence called
<div n="lb">Ṛṣabhakūṭa ?) and was practising austerities
<div n="lb">for many hundred years ({%anekaśatavarṣāyus%}
<div n="lb">{%tapasvī%}); he got angry when he was drawn
<div n="lb">into conversation by others; so he told the
<div n="lb">mountain to release rocks if any one uttered
<div n="lb">a word there; he summoned wind and bade
<div n="lb">him not to make noise; hence if any one tried
<div n="lb">to speak there he was restrained by a cloud

<div n="lb">7-9; (2) When gods formerly came to the
<div n="lb">river Nandā (flowing near Hemakūṭa) men
<div n="lb">followed there to see the gods; since the
[Page502-a+ 12]
<div n="lb">gods, Indra and the rest, did not wish to be
<div n="lb">seen by men they made the land inaccessible
<div n="lb">making this mountain an obstacle ({%durgaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%cakrur imaṃ deśaṃ giripratyūharūpakam%});
<div n="lb">hence men cannot even look at the mountain,
<div n="lb">let alone climb it; the gods then always per-
<div n="lb">formed best sacrifices there; the signs of
<div n="lb">those sacrifices could even now be seen in
<div n="lb">the form of the sprawling {%dūrvā%} grass having
