{@Uttama@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people ?
<div n="P">Bhīma in his expedition to the east,
<div n="lb">south and north ({%yayau prācīṃ diśaṃ prati%}
<div n="lb">2. 26. 1; {%tataḥ prācīṃ diśaṃ bhīmo yayau%}

<div n="lb">the Uttamas when he went beyond Ayo-
<div n="lb">dhyā and Gopālakaccha and then to the

<div n="lb">{%ca sottamān api cottarān … vyajayat pra-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhuḥ%}) 2. 27. 3; (since in 2. 27. 11 there is a
<div n="lb">reference to Dakṣiṇamallas, and in 2. 27. 3
<div n="lb">{%mallānām adhipaṃ caiva%} follows immedi-
<div n="lb">ately after {%sottamān api cottarān,%} it is very
<div n="lb">likely that {%uttarān%} and {%uttamān%} refer to the
<div n="lb">northern and most northern Mallas; the
<div n="lb">passage would then mean that Bhīma
<div n="lb">conquered the king of Mallas, together with
<div n="lb">the Uttara and Uttama Mallas; Edgerton,
<div n="lb">however, takes Uttara and Uttama as
<div n="lb">names of different peoples, see his note on
<div n="lb">this stanza in Cr. Ed. Vol. II, p. 501).
