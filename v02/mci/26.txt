[Page004-b+ 39]
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Family and Residence: Takṣaka's son
<div n="lb">and his constant companion ({%nityaṃ saha-%}
<div n="lb">{%carāv ubhau%}) 1. 3. 145; 1. 218. 5; 8. 65. 39;
<div n="lb">Uttaṅka mentions him, (while praising the
<div n="lb">{%nāgas%}), as one living at Kurukṣetra along the
<div n="lb">river Ikṣumatī 1. 3. 145. {@B.@} Khāṇḍava
<div n="lb">fire: He was at the Khāṇḍava forest at
<div n="lb">the time of the great fire, but escaped death
<div n="lb">1. 219. 40; his mother swallowed him,
<div n="lb">head first, so that when Arjuna cut off her
<div n="lb">head while she was flying upwards Aśvasena
<div n="lb">did not die 1. 218. 5, 1. 220. 2; Aśvasena
<div n="lb">could escape because Indra confounded
<div n="lb">Arjuna with {%Vātavarṣa%} (an {%astra ?%}) 1. 218.
<div n="lb">9. {@C.@} Part in the great war: Karṇa had a
<div n="lb">fiery arrow described as {%bhujaga%} (8. 66. 10),
<div n="lb">{%sarpamukha%} (8. 66. 5), poisonous (8. 66. 6,
<div n="lb">16); reserved by him for use against Arjuna
<div n="lb">8. 66. 5; when the arrow was shot it could
<div n="lb">remove only Arjuna's diadem ({%kirīṭa%}) 8. 66.
<div n="lb">11, 12, 15, 17; on this arrow apparently lay
<div n="lb">the big snake ({%mahoraga%}) Aśvasena, inimical
<div n="lb">to Arjuna due to the killing of his mother
<div n="lb">by Arjuna 8. 66. 20, 21; Arjuna killed him
<div n="lb">when Kṛṣṇa explained to him who the serpent
<div n="lb">really was 8. 66. 21, 24; Aśvasena not
<div n="lb">directly named in this incident, but Duryo-
<div n="lb">dhana names him as figuring in this incident
<div n="lb">when he mentions Aśvasena (as an arrow
<div n="lb">shot at Arjuna) who was deflected ({%vyaṃ-%}
<div n="lb">{%sanenāśvasenasya%}) by Kṛṣṇa 9. 60. 35.
