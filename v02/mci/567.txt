{@Vāyavyāstra, (Vāyavya)@}¦ nt. (rarely pl.
<div n="lb">1. 225. 12): Name of a missile related to
<div n="lb">god Vāyu 3. 164. 29; to Vāta 3. 161. 28;
<div n="lb">to Mātariśvan 4. 56. 14.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Description: heavenly ({%divya%})
<div n="lb">5. 181. 13; 7. 132. 28; best ({%uttama%}) 1. 218.
<div n="lb">15; very fierce ({%sudāruṇa%}) 6. 98. 20. {@B.@} Its
<div n="lb">knowledge: Arjuna learnt it from god Vāyu
<div n="lb">when he, after satisfying Mahādeva (Śiva),
<div n="lb">received it in the heaven along with many
<div n="lb">other heavenly weapons 1. 225. 12 (pl.
<div n="lb">{%vāyavyāni%}); 3. 164. 29; 3. 161. 28 (Vāta);
<div n="lb">4. 56. 14 (Mātariśvan); 6. 116. 38; but
<div n="lb">apparently he had also learnt it earlier
<div n="lb">from Droṇa since he used it while displaying
<div n="lb">his skill in archery (1. 125. 19), and at
<div n="lb">the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest
<div n="lb">(1. 218. 15); Droṇa, of course, knew it,
<div n="lb">and it was known to many other epic heroes,
<div n="lb">viz. Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman,
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira, and the Pāṇḍya king (see the
<div n="lb">next section); it was known also, perhaps, to
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 39. {@C.@} Use: (1) In the epic
<div n="lb">war: (i) by Arjuna, agaisnt the Trigartas;
<div n="lb">noticing its employment, Droṇa repelled it
<div n="lb">with the Śaila astra 6. 98. 18-20; against
<div n="lb">the Saṃśaptakas, to scatter their shower of
<div n="lb">arrows, when they covered Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
<div n="lb">with their arrows; the two, therefore, could
[Page138-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">not be seen and were mistaken to be dead
<div n="lb">7. 18. 17-22; god Vāyu carried away
<div n="lb">the Saṃśaptakas together with their horses,
<div n="lb">elephants, chariots and weapons like dried
<div n="lb">leaves; they looked like birds flying from
<div n="lb">trees 7. 18. 17-23; agaisnt Droṇa to repel
<div n="lb">the Vāyavyāstra released by him 7. 163. 28
<div n="lb">(here not specifically named: {%astṛāṇy astrair%}
<div n="lb">{%yadā tasya vidhivad dhanti pāṇḍavaḥ%});
<div n="lb">against Karṇa, to scatter the clouds created
<div n="lb">by his Vāruṇāstra 8. 67. 11; (ii) by
<div n="lb">Droṇa, against Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 28; again
<div n="lb">against Yudhiṣṭhira, when Droṇa was for
<div n="lb">a moment distressed by Yudhiṣṭhira's arrow
<div n="lb">and had to sit down in the chariot 7. 137.
<div n="lb">40-42; against the army of king Drupada
<div n="lb">to blow it away, as wind blows away the
<div n="lb">clouds 7. 136. 10; 7. 132. 37; against Arjuna
<div n="lb">7. 163. 28; (iii) by Yudhiṣṭhira, to combat
<div n="lb">successfully the same Astra used against him
<div n="lb">by Droṇa ({%astram astreṇa jaghnivān%})
<div n="lb">7. 132. 28; again to halt the same Astra used
<div n="lb">against him by Droṇa ({%tad astram astreṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%raṇe stambhayām āsa%}) 7. 137. 42; (iv) by
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman, against Ghaṭotkaca to blow him
<div n="lb">away ({%vyadhamat%}) when Ghaṭotkaca em-
<div n="lb">ployed his {%māyā%} to become a dark cloud to
<div n="lb">attack Aśvatthāman 7. 131. 71-72; (v) by
<div n="lb">Karṇa, against Ghaṭotkaca under similar
<div n="lb">conditions 7. 150. 70-71; (vi) by the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍya king, to obstruct ({%rudh-%}) the shower
<div n="lb">of arrows released by Aśvatthāman
<div n="lb">on his army 8. 15. 30-31; (2) Outside the
<div n="lb">epic war—(i) Arjuna used it by reciting
<div n="lb">{%mantras (abhimantrya)%} to dispel the clouds
<div n="lb">and the lightning created by Vāyu and Indra
<div n="lb">at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest
<div n="lb">1. 218. 15; Arjuna used it against Kirāta
<div n="lb">(Śiva), but the missile had no effect on
<div n="lb">him 3. 163. 29-30; against Droṇa at the
[Page139-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">time of the cattle-raid to swallow the Vāya-
<div n="lb">vyāstra used by Droṇa ({%vāyavyaṃ … %}
<div n="lb">{%astram astreṇa pāṇḍavaḥ/ … grasate%}
<div n="lb">{%sma … %}) 4. 53. 48; against Bhīṣma at the
<div n="lb">time of the cattle raid 4. 59. 21; at the
<div n="lb">time of displaying his skill in the use of
<div n="lb">missiles 1. 125. 19; (ii) by Bhīṣma, against
<div n="lb">Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 59.
<div n="lb">21; against Rāma Jāmadagnya who combated
<div n="lb">it with the use of the Guhyakāstra 5. 181.
<div n="lb">11; (iii) by Droṇa, against Arjuna at the
<div n="lb">time of the cattle-raid 4. 53. 48; (iv) the
<div n="lb">effect of the Vāyavyāstra was produced by
<div n="lb">the Nivātakavaca demons by employing
<div n="lb">their {%māyā%} while fighting with Arjuna; it
<div n="lb">produced wind, the velocity of which was
<div n="lb">obstructed by Arjuna by the use of the Śaila
<div n="lb">astra ({%śailena ca mahāstreṇa vāyor vegam%}
<div n="lb">{%adhārayam%}) 3. 168. 9-10; the demons again
<div n="lb">practised their different {%māyās%} simultaneously
<div n="lb">({%prākurvan vividhā māyā yaugapadyena%})
<div n="lb">and produced the Astra of Vāyu (along
<div n="lb">with that of Agni and the Aśmavarṣa); it
<div n="lb">oppressed Arjuna and produced darkness all
<div n="lb">around, which was dispelled by Arjuna
<div n="lb">by employing his Astramāyā 3. 168.
<div n="lb">11-13, 25-26. {@D.@} Effects: Arjuna
<div n="lb">created wind by the use of the Vāyavya astra
<div n="lb">({%vāyavyenāsṛjad vāyum%}) 1. 125. 19; the
<div n="lb">wind that was released by the use of the
<div n="lb">missile agitated the sky, felled the trees, and
<div n="lb">killed soldiers 6. 98. 18-20; when used against
<div n="lb">the Saṃśaptakas, god Vāyu ({%bhagavān%}
<div n="lb">{%vāyuḥ%}) swept them away together with their
<div n="lb">horses, elephants, chariots and weapons, like
<div n="lb">dried leaves; they appeared like birds flying
<div n="lb">away from trees 7. 18. 22-23. [See
