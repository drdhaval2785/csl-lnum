<div n="lb">the wind; King Mahābhiṣa, who happened to
<div n="lb">be there, constantly looked at her in that
<div n="lb">condition; he was therefore cursed to be born
<div n="lb">again as a human being; Gaṅgā returned
<div n="lb">from the assembly continuing to think about
<div n="lb">Mahābhīṣa; she saw the Vasus, dejected,
<div n="lb">going along the way; she asked them the
<div n="lb">cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her
[Page337-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">that they were cursed by Vasiṣṭha to be born
<div n="lb">as humans; they requested Gaṅgā to assume
<div n="lb">a human form so that she could give birth
<div n="lb">to them as humans; Gaṅgā agreed and asked
<div n="lb">them whom would they like to be their father;
<div n="lb">they chose Śaṃtanu, the son of Pratīpa;
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā also had thought of the same person,
<div n="lb">hence she would do what was dear to the king
<div n="lb">and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gaṅgā to
<div n="lb">throw them into water no sooner they were
<div n="lb">born; Gaṅgā agreed to even that request,
<div n="lb">but asked them to spare one of them so that
<div n="lb">Śaṃtanu's union with her would not be totally
<div n="lb">fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each
<div n="lb">one of them contributing one-eighth share for
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā's son; and they also told her that the
<div n="lb">son of the Gaṅgā would beget no son; having
<div n="lb">come to this agreement with the Gaṅgā

<div n="lb">of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget

<div n="lb">killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went
<div n="lb">to the Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and became mixed
<div n="lb">with her; as a result, Gaṅgā became pregnant;
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā could not bear the embryo, was men-

<div n="lb">when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely;
<div n="lb">terrified, the Gaṅgā was unable to bear the
<div n="lb">embryo; Jāhnavī, with her body covered with
<div n="lb">lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could
<div n="lb">not contain his lustre within her; she was
<div n="lb">very much uneasy and was agitated; she
<div n="lb">would like to cast away the embryo, as she
<div n="lb">could hold it no longer, and not because of
<div n="lb">her sweet will; she was no longer her usual
<div n="lb">self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the
<div n="lb">embryo within her: as she was capable of
<div n="lb">bearing and containing the whole earth there
[Page337-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">was nothing which Gaṅgā could not achieve
<div n="lb">except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni;
<div n="lb">in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the
<div n="lb">other gods the Gaṅgā cast off the embryo on
<div n="lb">mount Meru; Gaṅgā was capable of holding
<div n="lb">an embryo, but she could not do it on this
<div n="lb">occasion as she was overcome by the lustre
<div n="lb">of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared
<div n="lb">before Agni who asked her if the delivery
<div n="lb">was happy ({%kaccid garbhaḥ sukhodayaḥ%});
