{@Śakula@}¦ m.: A kind of fish.
<div n="P">Three of them, friends of one another,
<div n="lb">lived together in a shallow pond which
[Page060-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">abounded in fish; one of them was characteri-
<div n="lb">zed as Prāptakālajña ‘who knows the proper
<div n="lb">time (for action), who has the presence of
<div n="lb">mind’ (also called Saṃpratipattijña, Prati-
<div n="lb">pattimant, or Saṃpratipattimant 12. 135. 9,
<div n="lb">13, 15), the other as Dīrghadarśin ‘who has
<div n="lb">forethought’, and the third as Dīrghasūtra
<div n="lb">‘who procrastinates’; seeing, once, the water
<div n="lb">level falling down, Dīrghadarśin apprehended
<div n="lb">danger and told his friends that they had
<div n="lb">better quickly move out before their way to
<div n="lb">get out was cut off; Dīrghasūtra agreed with
<div n="lb">him but saw no reason to make haste;
<div n="lb">Saṃpratipattijña, however, said that he
<div n="lb">would not fail to take the correct course when
<div n="lb">time arrived; then Dīrghadarśin, of great
<div n="lb">intelligence, went out alone to a deep lake
<div n="lb">following a water current; when the water in
<div n="lb">the lake had thoroughly flown out the fisher-
<div n="lb">men began to catch the fish by various
<div n="lb">means; Dīrghasūtra got caught with others;
<div n="lb">when the fish that were caught were being tied
<div n="lb">to strings, Pratipattimant got himself mixed
<div n="lb">with those that were tied already and he held
<div n="lb">the string tight with his mouth (and thus
<div n="lb">escaped being actually tied by the string);
<div n="lb">when the fish, thus tied, were being washed
<div n="lb">in dirt-free water, Saṃprattimant gave up
<div n="lb">the string and escaped; the dull-witted and
<div n="lb">of low intelligence Dīrghasūtra, however,
<div n="lb">invited death on himself; thus one who does
<div n="lb">not recognize the most opportune time is
<div n="lb">destroyed like Dīrghasūtra; one like Saṃpra-
<div n="lb">tipattimant, who does not provide for his
<div n="lb">welfare in advance thinking himself to be
<div n="lb">clever, meets with danger; who, like Dīrgha-
<div n="lb">darśin, adopts proper course before the danger
<div n="lb">sets in, attains great bliss; this excellent
<div n="lb">{%ākhyāna%} ({%ākhyānam anuttamam%} 12. 135. 1)
<div n="lb">pertaining to the subject of deciding what
[Page060-b+ 36]
<div n="lb">should be done and what not was related by
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 135. 1-19.
