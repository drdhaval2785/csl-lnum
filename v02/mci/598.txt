<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa used it in his fight with Śālva;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa's arrows released from Śārṅga first
<div n="lb">failed to reach the Saubhapura of Śālva 3.
<div n="lb">21. 18; he again released {%ayutas%} of arrows
<div n="lb">against Śālva from his heavenly bow 3. 21.
<div n="lb">24; the arrows released from Śārṅga pierced
<div n="lb">the bodies of the demons in the Saubhapura
<div n="lb">and they fell down in the ocean 3. 21. 28;
<div n="lb">due to the {%māyā%} of Śālva, Kṛṣṇa saw the
<div n="lb">son of Śūra (Vasudeva) falling down from
<div n="lb">the Saubha; as a result, he was confused and
<div n="lb">the Śārṅga slipped down from his hand 3.
<div n="lb">22. 22-25; when Kṛṣṇa knew the truth, he
<div n="lb">picked up the splendid bow and shot arrows
<div n="lb">from it which cut off the heads of the

<div n="lb">enemies 3. 23. 1-2. {@E.@} Status: The
<div n="lb">Śārṅga bow of Viṣṇu counted among the only

<div n="lb">Vijaya of Mahendra ({%trīṇy evaitāni divyāni%}
<div n="lb">{%dhanūṃṣi divicāriṇām%}) 5. 155. 5; hence the
<div n="lb">Vijaya bow obtained by Rukmin is said to
<div n="lb">be comparable with the Śārṅga 5. 155. 4.
