<div n="lb">306. 23; God Sūrya blessed Yājñavalkya
<div n="lb">with a boon and told him that goddess
<div n="lb">Sarasvatī, in the form of speech, would enter

<div n="lb">Yājñavalkya was then to promulgate

<div n="lb">the god Sūrya a guest offering; he then
<div n="lb">composed with great delight the entire Śata-
<div n="lb">patha along with its secrets, and abstracts,
<div n="lb">and supplements; he taught it to his hundred
