<div n="lb">of Ayodhyā while he had gone for hunting;
<div n="lb">she had assumed the form of an extremely
<div n="lb">beautiful girl and attracted the king by her
<div n="lb">sweet voice; when she informed the king that
<div n="lb">she was a maiden ({%kanyāsmi%} 3. 190. 13),
<div n="lb">he expressed his desire to marry her; she
<div n="lb">gave her consent on condition ({%samaya%}
<div n="lb">3. 190. 15, 16) that she should not be shown
<div n="lb">water; the king agreed and stayed with her
<div n="lb">and took her to his town; he sported with
<div n="lb">her in isolation and did not attend to any-
<div n="lb">thing else; the king then lived with her in a

<div n="lb">{%idam udāram anudakam%} 3. 190 23); it was
<div n="lb">got ready for him by his minister; once
<div n="lb">while sporting with her the king became
<div n="lb">thirsty; they saw a well full of water; when

<div n="lb">water, Suśobhanā entered it and disappeared;
<div n="lb">when the king did not see her, he got the well
<div n="lb">emptied and saw a frog at the mouth of a
<div n="lb">hole; the angered king ordered the killing of
<div n="lb">all the frogs; when the frog king Āyu, in the
<div n="lb">form of a hermit, requested Parikṣit not to
<div n="lb">kill the innocent frogs he said that they had
<div n="lb">eaten up his beloved; the frog king then in-
<div n="lb">formed king Parikṣit that his beloved was his
<div n="lb">(Āyu's) daughter Suśobhanā who had cheated
<div n="lb">many kings before; this was her bad character
<div n="lb">({%tasyā dauḥśīlyam etat%} 3. 190. 37); king
<div n="lb">Parikṣit told Āyu that he wanted Suśobhanā
<div n="lb">and that she might be given back to him; Āyu
<div n="lb">gave Suśobhanā to Parikṣit and asked her to
<div n="lb">serve the king; he cursed his daughter that
<div n="lb">since she had cheated kings her children will
<div n="lb">not be good to Brāhmaṇas due to her false-
<div n="lb">hood ({%abrahmaṇyāni tavāpatyāni bhaviṣya-%}
<div n="lb">{%nty anṛtakatvāt tava%} 3. 190. 40); the king
<div n="lb">having got back Suśobhanā felt as if be had
<div n="lb">obtained the overlordship of the three worlds;
<div n="lb">Suśobhanā later gave birth to three sons Śala,
<div n="lb">Dala and Bala 3. 190. 3-43.
