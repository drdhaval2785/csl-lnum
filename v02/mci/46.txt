{@Elāpatra@}¦ m.: A mythical serpent.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Son of Kadrū 1. 31. 6, 2. {@B@} He
<div n="lb">told serpents what he heard when he crawled
<div n="lb">into the lap of his mother when the curse
<div n="lb">was pronounced by her; Brahmā had told the
<div n="lb">gods the remedy partially to avoid the effect
<div n="lb">of the curse; he therefore advised Vāsuki to
<div n="lb">give his sister Jaratkāru to give in marriage
<div n="lb">to sage Jaratkāru; their son would stop the
<div n="lb">sacrifice of snakes 1. 34. 1-18; his advice
<div n="lb">was received with joy by serpents 1. 35. 1;
<div n="lb">Brahmā informed gods that what Elāpatra
<div n="lb">had told the snakes was exactly what he
<div n="lb">had in mind; Elāpatra's advice was to the
<div n="lb">advantage of the serpents and that it would
<div n="lb">prove true 1. 35. 8, 11. {@C.@} Elāpatra's
<div n="lb">observation on life: One who is struck by fate
<div n="lb">takes recourse to fate since he finds no other
<div n="lb">way out ({%daivenopahato rājan yo bhaved%}
