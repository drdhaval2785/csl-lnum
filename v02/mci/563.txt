<div n="lb">12. 31. 29): A missile generally associated
<div n="lb">with Indra, but also on a few occasions
<div n="lb">with Kṛṣṇa and Śiva; also called Kuliśa

<div n="lb">accounts: (1) when the Kāleya demons, under
<div n="lb">the leadership of Vṛtra, attacked Indra and the
<div n="lb">other gods, Brahman advised them to approach
<div n="lb">the sage Dadhīca and ask him for his bones in
<div n="lb">order to fashion a Vajra out of it; with that
<div n="lb">Vajra, Indra was to kill Vṛtra 3. 98. 3-11;
<div n="lb">when the gods received the bones of Dadhīca,
<div n="lb">they took them to Tvaṣṭṛ and asked him to
<div n="lb">fashion a Vajra out of the bones; Tvaṣṭṛ,
<div n="lb">ritually ready ({%prayata%}) to receive the bones,
<div n="lb">was glad to fashion the Vajra which he did
<div n="lb">with great effort ({%prayatnāt%}) 3. 98. 22; when
<div n="lb">the Vajra was ready, Tvaṣṭṛ asked Indra
<div n="lb">to reduce his enemies to ashes with the
[Page131-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">excellent Vajra ({%vajrapravara%}); Indra too
<div n="lb">was happy and ritually ready ({%prayata%})
<div n="lb">to receive it 3. 98. 23-24; (2) Vajra created
<div n="lb">from the bones of Dadhīca in order to kill the
<div n="lb">three-headed Viśvarūpa, son of Tvaṣṭṛ; when
<div n="lb">the Vajra was fashioned by Dhātṛ, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb">entered it ({%viṣṇupraviṣṭa%}); with the Vajra,
<div n="lb">thus fortified, Indra cut off the heads of
<div n="lb">Viśvarūpa 12. 329. 25-27; 1. 127. 12; (3)
<div n="lb">during a conflict between the gods and the
<div n="lb">demons Indra searched the three worlds for a
<div n="lb">suitable weapon, but did not find it; he asked
<div n="lb">the gods to approach the sage Dadhīca to ask
<div n="lb">for his bones; when the bones were received,
<div n="lb">Indra got prepared out of them various

<div n="lb">paralysed Indra who wanted to strike him
<div n="lb">with Vajra (reference to the Khāṇḍava fire ?)
<div n="lb">13. 143. 26, 23; (ii) when Indra could not
<div n="lb">dissuade Uttaṅka from desisting to dig the

<div n="lb">threatened king Marutta, first through Agni,
<div n="lb">that in case the king did not forsake Saṃ-
<div n="lb">varta who acted as his priest at the sacri-
<div n="lb">fice, he would hurl his Vajra at him 14. 9. 24;
<div n="lb">he again threatened Marutta, through the Gan-

<div n="lb">Vajra against the king 14. 10. 1, 2, 4, 7;
<div n="lb">Saṃvarta, however, assured Marutta that if
<div n="lb">Indra with his Vajra arrived to strike the
<div n="lb">king, he would paralyse Indra, and that he
<div n="lb">had destroyed before the weapons of all the
<div n="lb">gods; Saṃvarta then said: “let the wind
<div n="lb">blow and may it drive away the Vajra to the

<div n="lb">Vṛtra; when struck by the Vajra, Vṛtra was

<div n="lb">as if he had not released the Vajra from his
<div n="lb">hand and that Vṛtra was not killed 3. 99. 15;

<div n="lb">with Vṛtra, and when the proper time came he
<div n="lb">would enter the Vajra of Indra 5. 10. 11-12;

<div n="lb">the fight that ensued, Indra came with Vajra

<div n="lb">Vajra (m.) killed him; Viṣṇu had entered the

<div n="lb">(d) in the fight between Indra and Vṛtra,

<div n="lb">to ether ({%ākāśa%}); each time Indra struck
<div n="lb">him with Vajra; finally Vṛtra entered Śakra

<div n="lb">away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that
<div n="lb">they were left without a share, Brahman
<div n="lb">advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca
<div n="lb">and request him to give up his body; the gods
<div n="lb">should then fashion a Vajra from the bones
<div n="lb">of Dadhīca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhīca
<div n="lb">gave up his body, Dhātṛ fashioned a Vajra
<div n="lb">out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced
<div n="lb">from the bones of a Brāhmaṇa and in which
<div n="lb">god Viṣṇu had entered, Indra killed Viśvarūpa
<div n="lb">and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b)
<div n="lb">when Indra failed to tempt Triśiras, son of
<div n="lb">Tvaṣṭṛ, with Apsarases while he was practis-

<div n="lb">in the form of a donkey ({%khara%} 12. 216. 12),
<div n="lb">Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra
<div n="lb">with his fist although Indra was equipped with

<div n="lb">12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told
<div n="lb">Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman
<div n="lb">not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his
<div n="lb">Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra
<div n="lb">asked Bali why he was not grieved although
<div n="lb">he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220.

<div n="lb">him (Indra) although he saw him with his
<div n="lb">Vajra raised ({%vajram udyamya tiṣṭhantam%})
<div n="lb">12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tran-

<div n="lb">(iv) Garuḍa episode: on his way to fetch
<div n="lb">{%amṛta,%} when Garuḍa flew to the mountain

<div n="lb">was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself,
<div n="lb">and Indra, he would let fall just one of his
<div n="lb">feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the
<div n="lb">missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra
<div n="lb">sought friendship with Garuḍa 1. 29. 17-23;
<div n="lb">(v) Fight between the gods and Skanda:
