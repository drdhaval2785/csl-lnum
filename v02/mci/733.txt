{@Parvasaṃgraha<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of the 2nd
<div n="lb">{%parvan%} in the list of a hundred sub-{%parvans%}
<div n="lb">of the Bhārata supposed to have been made
<div n="lb">by Vyāsa in the Parvasaṃgraha 1. 2. 34, 33,
<div n="lb">70, 243.
<div n="P">It constitutes the second {%adhyāya%} of
<div n="lb">the Ādiparvan in which the sub-{%parvans%} are
<div n="lb">listed (1. 2. 34-70) and the contents of the
<div n="lb">18 major {%parvans%} are summarized (1. 2.
<div n="lb">71-234); thus the Parvasaṃgraha forms the
[Page190-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">layout of the grand narrative of the Mahā-
<div n="lb">bhārata ({%ākhyānaṃ tad idam anuttamaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%mahārtham vinyastaṃ mahad iha parva-%}
<div n="lb">{%saṃgraheṇa%}) 1. 2. 243; if one first listens
<div n="lb">to this summary of the contents, it becomes
<div n="lb">easy for him to go through the Bhārata as
<div n="lb">one can easily float over the extensive ocean
<div n="lb">with a small boat 1. 2. 243.
