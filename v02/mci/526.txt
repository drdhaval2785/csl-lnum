{@Prasvāpa@}¦ nt.: Name of a missile which
<div n="lb">sent the adversary to sleep.
<div n="P">It was fashioned by Viśvakarman
<div n="lb">({%viśvakṛtam%}) and it belonged properly to
<div n="lb">Prajāpati ({%prājāpatyam%}) 5. 184. 12; des-
<div n="lb">cribed as ‘dear’ ({%sudayita, dayita%}) 5. 184.
<div n="lb">11; 5. 184. 15; 5. 185. 23; it was known
<div n="lb">to Bhīṣma in his former life ({%pūrvasmin%}
<div n="lb">{%dehadhāraṇe%}); in his long-drawn fight with
<div n="lb">Rāma Jāmadagnya, when Bhīṣma was deject-
<div n="lb">ed, the eight Vipras (Vasus) reminded him
<div n="lb">of this missile in a dream and told him
<div n="lb">that it would flash upon him again ({%idam%}
<div n="lb">{%astram sudayitam pratyabhijñāsyate bha-%}
<div n="lb">{%vān%}); the missile was not known to Rāma
<div n="lb">Jāmadagnya, and to no one else on the
<div n="lb">earth; the Vipras advised Bhīṣma to employ
<div n="lb">it forcefully ({%bhṛśaṃ saṃyojayasva%} 5. 184.
<div n="lb">13) against Rāma Jāmadagnya; as a result
<div n="lb">Rāma would not die but just go to sleep;
<div n="lb">in its use against his teacher Rāma, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">would incur no sin; Bhīṣma will have
<div n="lb">thus defeated Rāma with Prasvāpāstra (to
<div n="lb">be awakened by him later by using Saṃbo-
<div n="lb">dhanāstra); since Rāma could not be killed
<div n="lb">in battle, he was to be defeated by using
<div n="lb">Prasvāpāstra; the Vipras told Bhīṣma that
<div n="lb">a hero sent to sleep in battle and the
<div n="lb">one killed were considered by them equal
<div n="lb">({%prasuptaṃ vā mṛtaṃ vāpi tulyaṃ manyā-%}
<div n="lb">{%mahe vayam%} 5. 184. 16) 5. 184. 9-17; the
<div n="lb">next day when Bhīṣma thought of the missile
<div n="lb">for employing it, it flashed in his mind
<div n="lb">({%cintitaṃ ca tad astraṃ me manasi pratya-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhāt tadā%}) 5. 185. 22-23; the gods, appear-
<div n="lb">ing in the heaven, however, forbade Bhīṣma
[Page118-b+ 39]
<div n="lb">from using Prasvāpa against Rāma; as
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma put the arrow on his bow, Nārada
<div n="lb">drew Bhīṣma's attention to what the gods
<div n="lb">asked him and he told Bhīṣma not to insult
<div n="lb">Rāma who was his teacher; the eight Vipras
<div n="lb">also asked Bhīṣma to do what Nārada told
<div n="lb">him, since therein lay the welfare of the worlds
<div n="lb">({%etad dhi paramaṃ śreyo lokānām%}); hence
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma withdrew the missile; when Rāma
<div n="lb">saw Bhīṣma withdrawing the missile he
<div n="lb">accepted defeat at the hands of Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">({%dṛṣṭvā tad astraṃ vinivartitaṃ vai/jito%}
<div n="lb">{%'smi Bhīṣmeṇa sumandabuddhir ity eva%}
<div n="lb">{%vākyaṃ sahasā vyamuñcat%}) 5. 186. 1-8.
