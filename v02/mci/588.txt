<div n="lb">by Indra for Karṇa's armour and ear-rings:
<div n="lb">God Sūrya advised Karṇa to obtain from
<div n="lb">Indra his unfailing Śakti in exchange for
<div n="lb">({%niyamena%}) the armour ({%kavaca%}) and
<div n="lb">the ear-rings ({%kuṇḍalas%}) which Indra
<div n="lb">would ask Karṇa to part with 3. 286.
<div n="lb">14-15; after receiving this hint, Karṇa long-
<div n="lb">ing for the Śakti waited for Vāsava (Indra)
<div n="lb">3. 286. 20; when Indra came and begged
<div n="lb">Karṇa of his {%kavaca%} and {%kuṇḍalas,%} Karṇa
<div n="lb">asked Indra's unfailing Śakti in return 3. 294.
<div n="lb">20-21; Indra agreed to part with his Śakti
<div n="lb">under the stipulation that although the Śakti,
<div n="lb">when used by Indra, would unfailingly kill
<div n="lb">Indra's enemies {%by hundreds%} and return to
<div n="lb">Indra's (user's) hand, when it reached Karṇa
<div n="lb">it would kill only {%one%} illustrious, roaring and
<div n="lb">tormenting enemy of Karṇa and return, not to
<div n="lb">Karṇa, but to Indra ({%seyaṃ tava karaṃ prā-%}

<div n="lb">3. 294. 23-25; the Śakti, as long as it was
<div n="lb">with Karṇa, would fail after killing one hero

<div n="lb">agreed to receive the Śakti on that condition
<div n="lb">for he feared danger in battle only from one
<div n="lb">enemy 3. 294. 26, 29; Indra also warned
<div n="lb">Karṇa not to use the Śakti when other missiles
<div n="lb">were available with him and when he was
<div n="lb">not in danger; if used negligently the
<div n="lb">Śakti would boomerang on Karṇa ({%vidya-%}

<div n="lb">{%pramatto mokṣyase cāpi tvayyevaiṣā%}
<div n="lb">{%patiṣyati//%}) 3. 294. 33; Karṇa vowed to
<div n="lb">Indra ({%satyam etad bravīmi te%}) that
<div n="lb">he would release the Vāsavī (Śakti) only
<div n="lb">when he was in great danger 3. 294. 34;
<div n="lb">Karṇa then received the burning Sakti in
<div n="lb">exchange of his {%kavaca%} and {%kuṇḍalas%} 3. 294.
<div n="lb">35, 38; 8. 5. 65. {@C.@} What the Śakti meant
<div n="lb">to Karṇa: Karṇa had great confidence due to
<div n="lb">the Śakti ({%ayaṃ ca pratyayaḥ karṇe śaktyā%})
<div n="lb">7. 157. 31; when Vāsava (Indra) gave the
<div n="lb">Śakti to Karṇa, he (Karṇa) felt that Arjuna
<div n="lb">was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with
<div n="lb">Śakti in Karṇa's hand, no one in the world
<div n="lb">dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karṇa had
<div n="lb">preserved the Śakti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33;
<div n="lb">7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the Śakti meant
<div n="lb">death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duḥśāsana,
<div n="lb">Śakuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always
<div n="lb">counselled Karṇa not to use the Śakti against
<div n="lb">any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf.
<div n="lb">7. 157. 19-21 for the use of Śakti (not named)
<div n="lb">only against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa); if on any
<div n="lb">occasion Karṇa's other missiles had failed and
<div n="lb">if he was pressed ({%pīḍitaḥ%}) by the circums-
<div n="lb">tances, he would certainly have used his
<div n="lb">Vāsavī Śakti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54;
<div n="lb">hence Kṛṣṇa protected Arjuna particularly
<div n="lb">from the unfailing Śakti which, if released,
[Page146-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">would certainly have killed him like the light-
<div n="lb">ning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16;
<div n="lb">according to Vyāsa too if Arjuna and
<div n="lb">Karṇa had clashed, the latter, after exhaus-
<div n="lb">ting all other missiles, would have surely
<div n="lb">used Vāsavī against Arjuna 7. 158. 56;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa was therefore always looking for a
<div n="lb">way to render the unfailing Śakti futile
<div n="lb">({%amoghāṃ tāṃ kathaṃ śaktiṃ moghāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%kuryām%}) 7. 157. 29; when the Śakti was
<div n="lb">diverted on Ghaṭotkaca, Karṇa, in the
<div n="lb">opinion of Kṛṣṇa, was as good as dead
<div n="lb">7. 155. 12; when Karṇa was relieved
<div n="lb">of his Śakti, he became an ordinary
<div n="lb">human being ({%so 'dya mānuṣatāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%prāpto vimuktaḥ śakradattayā%} 7. 155. 27),
<div n="lb">and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33.
<div n="lb">{@D.@} Why the Śakti was not used against
<div n="lb">Arjuna: Both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sātyaki asked
<div n="lb">Saṃjaya and Kṛṣṇa respectively why the Śakti
<div n="lb">was not used by Karṇa against Arjuna 7.
<div n="lb">157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) accor-
<div n="lb">ding to Saṃjaya's reporting, Duryodhana,
<div n="lb">Śakuni, Duḥśāsana, and he himself urged
<div n="lb">Karṇa every night after the day's war to use
<div n="lb">his Śakti the next day against Arjuna or
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was
<div n="lb">forgotten the next day during the fight due
<div n="lb">to the watchfulness of Kṛṣṇa ({%sā tu buddhiḥ%}
<div n="lb">{%kṛtāpy evaṃ jāgrati tridaśeśvare/aprameye%}
<div n="lb">{%hṛṣīkeśe yuddhakāle vyamuhyata%}) 7. 157. 27;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa also never brought Arjuna face to face
<div n="lb">with Karṇa as long as the latter was equipped
<div n="lb">with Śakti; Kṛṣṇa managed to see that
<div n="lb">other warriors faced Karṇa 7. 157. 28-29;
<div n="lb">according to Saṃjaya, again, the previous
<div n="lb">night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten
<div n="lb">by Karṇa the next day due to the deities
<div n="lb">(unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes
<div n="lb">(on the side of the Kauravas), and thus
[Page146-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">it was primarily due to the working of the
<div n="lb">fate that Karṇa did not employ his Śakti
<div n="lb">against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa to kill any one of
<div n="lb">them ({%tataḥ prabhātasamaye rājan karṇasya%}
<div n="lb">{%daivataiḥ/anyeṣāṃ caiva yodhānāṃ sā%}
<div n="lb">{%buddhir naśyate punaḥ//daivam eva paraṃ%}

<div n="lb">{%jaghāna raṇe pārthaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ vā devakī-%}
<div n="lb">{%sutam//%} 7. 158. 6-7; also 8-9; (2) accor-
<div n="lb">ding to Vyāsa too it was due to fate
<div n="lb">({%diṣṭyā%}) that Arjuna was not locked in
<div n="lb">a duel with Karṇa prior to the latter's being
<div n="lb">relieved of the Śakti 7. 158. 54; according
<div n="lb">to him Ghaṭotkaca was killed by Time
<div n="lb">using Vāsavī as his means ({%vāsavīṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%kāraṇaṃ kṛtvā kālenāpahato hy asau%})
<div n="lb">7. 158. 58; (3) according to Kṛṣṇa he
<div n="lb">deluded the mind of Karṇa and hence he did
<div n="lb">not use his Śakti against Arjuna ({%aham%}
<div n="lb">{%eva tu rādheyaṃ mohayāmi yudhāṃ vara%}
<div n="lb">7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">both fate and the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">came together to defeat the purpose of the
<div n="lb">Kauravas and hence the Vāsavī (Śakti)
<div n="lb">killed Ghaṭotkaca instead of Arjuna
<div n="lb">({%daivenaiva hatā yūyaṃ svabuddhyā%}
<div n="lb">{%keśavasya ca/gatā hi vāsavī hatvā%}
<div n="lb">{%tṛṇabhūtaṃ ghaṭotkacam%}) 7. 158. 10.
<div n="lb">{@E.@} Use: (1) By Karṇa: All the Kuru
<div n="lb">warriors urged Karṇa to kill the demon
<div n="lb">Ghaṭotkaca by using the Śakti given to him
<div n="lb">by Vāsava and save the Kauravas and their
<div n="lb">warriors from destruction; hearing that call,
<div n="lb">Karṇa held the Śakti desiring to kill Ghaṭot-
<div n="lb">kaca, that Śakti given to him by Śakra
<div n="lb">and which he had preserved for Arjuna
<div n="lb">for years; when the missile was released,
<div n="lb">Ghaṭotkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form
<div n="lb">of the foot of the Vindhya mountain and
<div n="lb">fled; the beings in the mid-region wailed
[Page147-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">at the sight of the Śakti; the released Śakti
<div n="lb">first burnt the {%māyā%} of Ghaṭotkaca, and
<div n="lb">then broke open deeply the chest of Ghaṭot-
<div n="lb">kaca and went up in the sky, shining at night,
<div n="lb">to enter the spaces between the {%nakṣatras%}
<div n="lb">({%ūrdhvaṃ yayau dīpyamānā niśāyāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%nakṣatrāṇām antarāṇy āviśantī%} 7. 154. 57);
<div n="lb">Ghaṭotkaca, with his vitals pierced by the
<div n="lb">Śakti, was killed 7. 154. 48-59; 7. 156. 24;
<div n="lb">7. 158. 10; 8. 5. 71; by asking Ghaṭotkaca
<div n="lb">to fight with Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa diverted the Śakti
<div n="lb">on him 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. (5), 6, 39;
<div n="lb">7. 155. 12, 14; (Kṛṣṇa said that if
<div n="lb">Karṇa had not killed Ghaṭotkaca with his
<div n="lb">Śakti, he would have killed Ghaṭotkaca
<div n="lb">7. 156. 25); (2) By Indra: When used
<div n="lb">by Indra while fighting with the Daityas,
<div n="lb">the Śakti, after killing his enemies by hun-
<div n="lb">dreds, returned to Indra's hand 3. 294. 24;
<div n="lb">3. 286. 16 (killing of the enemies by
<div n="lb">hundreds and thousands). [See {@Śakti<sup>2-5</sup>@}]
