{@Vinatā@}¦ f.: A mythical female being.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Family: One of the two daughters
<div n="lb">of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1),
<div n="lb">both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one
<div n="lb">of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59.
<div n="lb">12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24.
<div n="lb">{@B.@} Description: Divine ({%devī%}) 1. 14. 15;
<div n="lb">beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5;
[Page057-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">shining ({%śubhā,%} also 1. 14. 5), auspicious
<div n="lb">({%kalyāṇī%}) and famous ({%yaśasvinī%}) 1. 27. 24.
<div n="lb">{@C.@} Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband,
<div n="lb">granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose
<div n="lb">to have two sons, stronger than the sons of
<div n="lb">Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a
<div n="lb">half sons as desired ({%? adhyardhaṃ putram%}
<div n="lb">{%īpsitam%} 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that
<div n="lb">one of her two sons was not fully developed ?
<div n="lb">1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said
<div n="lb">“so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know
<div n="lb">that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 6-
<div n="lb">10; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs
<div n="lb">which were preserved for five hundred years
<div n="lb">in warm pots by the female attendants
<div n="lb">({%sopasvedeṣu bhāṇḍeṣu%} 1. 14. 13; Nī. {%sopas-%}
<div n="lb">{%vedeṣu uṣmavatsu%} on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.);
<div n="lb">when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons
<div n="lb">came out of the eggs but nothing came out of
<div n="lb">the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and
<div n="lb">desirous of quickly having a son, broke one
<div n="lb">of the two eggs and saw her partly developed
<div n="lb">son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also
<div n="lb">1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the
<div n="lb">slave ({%dāsī%} 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she
<div n="lb">vied; he also told the mother that her second
<div n="lb">son will free her from slavery if she did not
<div n="lb">break the other egg prematurely and produce
<div n="lb">a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son
<div n="lb">became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was
<div n="lb">born at proper time; as soon as born he left
<div n="lb">Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1.
<div n="lb">26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son,
<div n="lb">practised penance and observed vows; having
<div n="lb">bathed and become pure she approached her
<div n="lb">husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male
<div n="lb">child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would
<div n="lb">succeed and that she would give birth to heroic
<div n="lb">sons; he also told her to carefully bear the
<div n="lb">{%garbha;%} Vinatā delighted when thus addressed
[Page057-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and
<div n="lb">Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa
<div n="lb">and Garuḍa called {%vainateyau%} ‘sons of
<div n="lb">Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two
<div n="lb">sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas
<div n="lb">and the conception of Kaśyapa ({%tapasā vāla-%}
<div n="lb">{%khilyānāṃ mama saṃkalpajau tathā/bha-%}
<div n="lb">{%viṣyato mahābhāgau putrau te lokapūjitau%})
<div n="lb">1. 27. 27; 1. 27. 1-2; besides Aruṇa and
<div n="lb">Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi
<div n="lb">also called {%vainateyāḥ%} 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62
<div n="lb">(with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place
<div n="lb">of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending
<div n="lb">from her ({%vinatākula%}), of noble family,
<div n="lb">propagated by Garuḍa through his six sons
<div n="lb">5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya<sup>1</sup>]. {@D.@} Slave
<div n="lb">of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and
<div n="lb">Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥ-
<div n="lb">śravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū
<div n="lb">later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse;
<div n="lb">Vinatā declared it to be white and asked
<div n="lb">Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a
<div n="lb">wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse
<div n="lb">had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to
<div n="lb">lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then
<div n="lb">went home agreeing to inspect the horse the
<div n="lb">next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two
<div n="lb">sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from
<div n="lb">near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1.
<div n="lb">19. 1-3; when they found that there were
<div n="lb">many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas,
<div n="lb">Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who
<div n="lb">lost the bet and was defeated was grieved
<div n="lb">to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1.
<div n="lb">20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited
<div n="lb">the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the
<div n="lb">ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence
<div n="lb">of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful
<div n="lb">Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the {%nāgas%} in the
<div n="lb">middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as command-
[Page058-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">ed and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother,
<div n="lb">carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked
<div n="lb">Vinatā why he must act as told by the ser-
<div n="lb">pents; Vinatā informed him that she having
<div n="lb">lost the wager had become the slave of her
<div n="lb">sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa
<div n="lb">how he (and his mother) could be free from
<div n="lb">slavery, told him to get {%amṛta%} for them
<div n="lb">to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12;
<div n="lb">Garuḍa got ready to fetch {%amṛta%} and
<div n="lb">asked Vinatā what he might eat on way;
<div n="lb">Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose
<div n="lb">abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean
<div n="lb">({%samudrakukṣāv ekānte%} 1. 24. 2), and warned
<div n="lb">him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3;
<div n="lb">on being further asked by Garuḍa how he
<div n="lb">could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him:
<div n="lb">“who, when swallowed, burns your throat like
<div n="lb">a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāh-
<div n="lb">maṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the
<div n="lb">incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him
<div n="lb">as follows: “May Wind protect your wings,
<div n="lb">Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun
<div n="lb">the whole of you; myself shall always endeav-
<div n="lb">our for your comfort and well-being ({%śānti-%}
<div n="lb">{%svastiparāyaṇā%} 1. 24. 9); may your path
<div n="lb">be free from obstacles and may you succeed
<div n="lb">in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa
<div n="lb">met his father and told him that he was on his
<div n="lb">way to fetch {%soma%} in order to free his mother
<div n="lb">from slavery; he also told him that he was
<div n="lb">asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was
<div n="lb">not satisfied even after eating thousands of
<div n="lb">them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might
<div n="lb">eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in
<div n="lb">getting {%soma (amṛta)%} he approached his
<div n="lb">mother and told the serpents that since he
<div n="lb">was leaving the {%amṛta%} for them on {%kuśa%} grass
<div n="lb">his mother should be freed from slavery from
<div n="lb">that day; the serpents said: “so be it”;
[Page058-b+ 38]
<div n="lb">Garuḍa then roamed in the forest with his
<div n="lb">mother Vinatā and gave delight to her 1. 30.
<div n="lb">14-17, 21. {@E.@} Functions: Vinatā is one
<div n="lb">of those (like Surasā, Surabhi and many
<div n="lb">others) who wait upon Pitāmaha in his {%sabhā%}
<div n="lb">2. 11. 29, 31. {@F.@} Svāhā identified with
<div n="lb">Vinatā ?: Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa
<div n="lb">(3. 213. 50) while getting away with the seed
<div n="lb">of Agni assumed the form of a female Garuḍa
<div n="lb">({%garuḍī%}), a female Suparṇa ({%suparṇī%}) to
<div n="lb">escape identification 3. 214. 7-10); 3. 215. 3;
<div n="lb">Svāhā as Vinatā (as Suparṇī 3. 215. 4) told
<div n="lb">Skanda that he was her son qualified to give
<div n="lb">her the {%śrāddha%} oblation ({%mama tvaṃ piṇḍa-%}
<div n="lb">{%daḥ sutaḥ%}) 3. 219. 12; as one of the mothers
<div n="lb">of Skanka, Vinatā, highly ferocious, assumes
<div n="lb">the form of a {%śikunigraha%} (bird-affliction ?)
<div n="lb">to torment young children until they are
<div n="lb">sixteen years old 3. 219. 26, 22, 41.
