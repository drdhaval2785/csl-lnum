<div n="lb">sage Agniveśya, Agniveśya to Droṇa, and
<div n="lb">Droṇa to Arjuna 1. 158. 26-27; 1. 121. 6-7;
<div n="lb">but Arjuna told Uttara that he obtained
<div n="lb">Āgneyāstra from god Agni 4. 56. 14; when
<div n="lb">Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa expressed his desire
<div n="lb">to learn the {%astra,%} Arjuna taught it to him in
<div n="lb">exchange of the Gandharva horses ({%gandhar-%}

<div n="lb">Arjuna taught it to the Gandharva with due
<div n="lb">rites ({%yathāvidhi%}) 1. 174. 3; when Arjuna
<div n="lb">requested Indra for heavenly weapons, Indra
<div n="lb">assured him that he would give him all the
<div n="lb">heavenly missiles, {%āgneya%} and the rest
<div n="lb">({%āgneyāni ca sarvāṇi%}) after Arjuna had
<div n="lb">satisfied god Mahādeva 1. 225. 12, 10; among
<div n="lb">the epic heroes, besides Droṇa and Arjuna,
[Page091-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">its use was known also to Kṛṣṇa (6. 116. 38;
<div n="lb">also see {@Āgneyāstra<sup>2</sup>@}), Bhīṣma, Karṇa and
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman (7. 166. 2) [See the section {@C@}

<div n="lb">4. 59. 21; irresistible even by the gods ({%devair%}
<div n="lb">{%api sudurdharṣam%}) 7. 172. 14. {@C.@} Its
<div n="lb">use in war and its effects: 1. In the epic
<div n="lb">war: (i) when used by Karṇa against
<div n="lb">Arjuna, it gave to Karṇa's bow a fiery
<div n="lb">look and it released fiery arrows; Arjuna
<div n="lb">apparently combated it with the same kind of
<div n="lb">{%astra (astraṃ astreṇa saṃvārya%}) 7. 31. 51-
<div n="lb">52; (ii) used by Droṇa against Yuyudhāna
<div n="lb">(Sātyaki); this was combated by Sātyaki
<div n="lb">with Vāruṇāstra 7. 73. 46; (iii) Bhāradvāja
<div n="lb">(Droṇa) used Āgneya and other heavenly
<div n="lb">missiles against Yudhiṣṭhira which were ren-
<div n="lb">dered ineffective by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 29-30;
<div n="lb">(iv) Aśvatthāman used it against Arjuna;
<div n="lb">when released, it produced a shower of
<div n="lb">arrows ({%śaravarṣam ajāyata%} 7. 172. 16;
<div n="lb">{%śaravṛṣṭayaḥ%} 7. 172. 22); cold winds blew, sun
<div n="lb">lost its lustre, clouds rained blood, all beings
<div n="lb">became restless; the arrows were fiery and
<div n="lb">produced good deal of heat; they burnt down
<div n="lb">enemies, elephants, horses and chariots; the
<div n="lb">god Fire burnt the army like the Saṃvartaka
<div n="lb">fire at the end of the aeon 7. 172. 16-27; the
<div n="lb">whole army, including Arjuna, could not be
<div n="lb">seen due to the darkness; the like of the {%astra%}
<div n="lb">released by Aśvatthāman was never seen
<div n="lb">before by Saṃjaya and his colleagues 7. 172.
<div n="lb">30-31; Arjuna combated it with Brāhma Astra
<div n="lb">7. 172. 14, 32; it was meant to be used by
<div n="lb">Arjuna in the war 5. 140. 6 (here referred to
<div n="lb">as Āgni instead of Āgneya). 2. Outside
<div n="lb">the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it against
<div n="lb">Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa; when released, it
[Page092-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">burnt down the excellent chariot of Aṅgāra-
<div n="lb">parṇa, and he fell down, head downwards, as
<div n="lb">he swooned due to the lustre of the missile 1.
<div n="lb">158. 28, 29, 37; (ii) used by Droṇa (besides
<div n="lb">using other divine missiles) against Arjuna at
<div n="lb">the time of the cattle-raid; Arjuna combated
<div n="lb">it with his Āgneyāstra 4. 53. 48; (iii) on the
<div n="lb">same occasion used by Bhīṣma and Arjuna
<div n="lb">against each other to combat each other's
<div n="lb">missiles 4. 59. 21; (iv) in his fight with
<div n="lb">Citrasena and the Gandharvas Arjuna killed
<div n="lb">thousands of Gandharvas with Āgneyāstra
<div n="lb">3. 234. 7; when released once again, the
<div n="lb">Gandharvas, afflicted by heat, were dejected
<div n="lb">3. 234. 17; (v) at the time of displaying
<div n="lb">his skill in the use of missiles, Arjuna
<div n="lb">produced fire by releasing Āgneyāstra 1. 125.
<div n="lb">19; (vi) employed by Bhīṣma against
<div n="lb">Rāma (Jāmadagnya); it was rendered in-
<div n="lb">effective by the counter-use of Vāruṇāstra
<div n="lb">5. 181. 12. {@D.@} Mode of use: The normal
<div n="lb">arrows were supposed to be infused by this
<div n="lb">{%astra%} ({%astre te vāruṇāgneye tābhyāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%bāṇasamāhite%} 7. 73. 48) by reciting {%mantras%}
<div n="lb">over it ({%anumantrya%} 5. 181. 12, {%abhimantrya%}
<div n="lb">7. 172. 15); Aśvatthāman also sipped water
<div n="lb">({%vāry upaspṛśya%} 7. 172. 14) before reciting
<div n="lb">{%mantras.%} {@E.@} Status: Inferior to Śivā's
<div n="lb">Pāśupatāstra 13. 14. 127.
