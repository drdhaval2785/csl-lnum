<div n="lb"/>avatār or incarnation of Vishnu. He was a Brahman,

<div n="lb"/>ning of the second or Treta age, for the purpose of
<div n="lb"/>repressing the tyranny, and punishing the violence of

<div n="lb"/>triyas. Some of his names are {#paraSurAmaH -makaH, paraSuDaraH, parSurAmaH,#}
<div n="lb"/>{#jamadagnisutaH, jAmadagnyaH#}. 2. Rāmachandra or the moon-like
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. He was
<div n="lb"/>born into the world as the son of Daśaratha, king of
<div n="lb"/>Oude, and great grandson of Raghu, at the close of the
<div n="lb"/>second or Treta age, for the purpose of destroying the
<div n="lb"/>demons who infested the earth, and especially Rāvana, the
