<div n="lb"/>PURĀNA¦, {%s.%} (Sacred and mythological poem, derived from the
<div n="lb"/>same religious system as the Rāmāyana and Mahābhā-
<div n="lb"/>rata. or from the mytho-heroic style of Hindu belief:
<div n="lb"/>being a departure from the purer system of the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>They are eighteen in number, and each one is supposed
<div n="lb"/>to treat of five topics, viz. 1. the creation, 2. the destruc-
<div n="lb"/>tion and renovation of worlds, 3. the genealogy of gods
<div n="lb"/>and heroes, 4. the reign of the Manus, 5. the transac-
<div n="lb"/>[Page644-a+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>tions of their descendants. From this five-fold division,
<div n="lb"/>and from the antiquity of the stories narrated, come the
<div n="lb"/>general names {#purARaM, paYcalakzaRaM#}. The specific titles are
<div n="lb"/>as follows: 1. {#brahmapurARaM#} or {#brAhmapurARaM,#} 2. {#padnapurARaM,#} 3. {#vizRupu-#}
<div n="lb"/>{#rARaM,#} 4. {#SivapurARaM,#} 5. {#BAgavatapurARaM#} or {#BagavatpurARaM,#} 6. {#nAradapurARaM,#}
<div n="lb"/>7. {#mArkaRqapurARaM, mArkaRqeyapurARaM,#} 8. {#agnipurARaM,#} 9. {#BavizyapurARaM,#} 10. {#brahma-#}
<div n="lb"/>{#vEvarttapurARaM,#} 11. {#liNgapurARaM,#} 12. {#varAhapurARaM,#} 13. {#skandapurARaM,#} 14. {#bAma-#}
<div n="lb"/>{#napurARaM,#} 15. {#kUrmmapurARaM,#} 16, {#matsyapurARaM,#} 17. {#gAruqapurARaM,#} 18. {#brahmA-#}
<div n="lb"/>{#RqapurARaM#}. Sometimes a Purāna called the {#vAyupurARaM#} or
<div n="lb"/>{#vAyavIyapurARaM#} is substituted for the {#SivapurARaM,#} and another
<div n="lb"/>called the {#narasiMhapurARaM#} for the {#brahmARqapurARaM#}. These eighteen
<div n="lb"/>mythological works are the repository of the modern
<div n="lb"/>and popular religious creed of the Hindūs. They are
<div n="lb"/>amplifications of the two great heroic and historical
<div n="lb"/>poems or Itihāsa, called Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>giving a more connected and definite explanation of the
<div n="lb"/>mythical fictions and historical traditions contained in
<div n="lb"/>those works. They are consequently remarkable for
<div n="lb"/>attributing paramount importance to the two divinities,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Vishnu, who, under one form or other, are
<div n="lb"/>almost the sole objects that are made to claim homage.
<div n="lb"/>Each separate Purāna cannot, therefore, be taken as a
<div n="lb"/>guide to Hindū belief as a whole, but rather to some
<div n="lb"/>separate branch of it, in which the worship of either
<div n="lb"/>one of these deities in particular incarnations is en-
<div n="lb"/>couraged in preference to that of the other. The most
<div n="lb"/>celebrated of them all is the fifth in the above list, or
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata Purāna, designed for the glorification of Bha-
<div n="lb"/>gavat or Vishnu, in the form of Krishna. This exer-
<div n="lb"/>cises a more direct and powerful influence on the
<div n="lb"/>opinions of the natives of India than any other. The
<div n="lb"/>third, or Vishnu Purāna, translated by Professor Wilson,
<div n="lb"/>is also a work of great celebrity, and conforms most
<div n="lb"/>closely to the definition of Panchalakshanam, {%i. e.%} treat-
<div n="lb"/>ing of five specified topics. There are also eighteen
<div n="lb"/>Upapuranas, or similar poems of inferior sanctity and
<div n="lb"/>different appellations, viz.: 1. {#sanatkumAraM,#} 2. {#nArasiMhaM,#} 3. {#nAra-#}
<div n="lb"/>{#dIyaM,#} 4. {#SivaM,#} 5. {#durvAsasaM,#} 6. {#kApilaM,#} 7. {#mAnavaM,#} 8. {#OSAnasaM,#} 9. {#varuRaM,#}
<div n="lb"/>10. {#kAlikA,#} 11. {#SamBaM,#} 12. {#nandikeSvaraM,#} 13. {#sOraM,#} 14. {#pArASaraM,#}
<div n="lb"/>15. {#AdityaM,#} 16. {#mAheSvaraM,#} 17. {#BAgavataM,#} 18. {#vaSizWaM#}. The collector
<div n="lb"/>and arranger of the Purānas, as well as of the more
<div n="lb"/>ancient Vedas, was a sage named Krishna {#kfzRaH,#} or Dwai-
<div n="lb"/>pāyana {#dvEpAyanaH,#} or Kṛṣnadvaipāyana {#kfzRadvEpAyanaH#}.
<div n="lb"/>The surname of Vyāsa {#vyAsaH#} or ‘Arranger’ (from the
<div n="lb"/>root {#as#} with {#vi,#} meaning to ‘dispose’ or ‘set in order’),
<div n="lb"/>was given to him, and is now used to denote any ex-
<div n="lb"/>pounder of the Vedas or Purānas. His seat is called
<div n="lb"/>{#vyAsAsanaM, vyAsapIWaM#}.
