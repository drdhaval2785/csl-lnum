<div n="lb"/>VISHNU¦, {%s.%} {#vizRuH#}. The second person of the Hindū triad,
<div n="lb"/>and the most celebrated and popular of all the Indian
<div n="lb"/>deities. He is the personification of the preserving
<div n="lb"/>power, and became incarnate in nine different forms, for
<div n="lb"/>the preservation of mankind in various emergencies.
<div n="lb"/>Before the creation of the universe, and after its tem-
<div n="lb"/>porary annihilation, he is supposed to sleep on the
<div n="lb"/>waters, floating on the serpent Śeṣa, and is then identi-
<div n="lb"/>fied with Nārāyana. Brahmā, the creator, is fabled to
<div n="lb"/>spring at that time from a lotus which grows from his
<div n="lb"/>navel, whilst thus asleep. Viṣṇu's wife is called Lak-
<div n="lb"/>ṣmī, and the vehicle on which he rides, Garuḍa. {%See%}
<div n="lb"/>LAKSHMI, GARUḌA. His ten avatārs or incarnations are:
<div n="lb"/>1. The Matsya, or Fish. In this avatār Viṣṇu descended
<div n="lb"/>in the form of a fish to save the pious king Satyavrata,
<div n="lb"/>who with the seven Ṛiṣis and their wives had taken
<div n="lb"/>refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then
<div n="lb"/>destroyed the earth. 2. The Kūrma, or Tortoise. In
<div n="lb"/>this he descended in the form of a tortoise, for the pur-
<div n="lb"/>pose of restoring to man some of the comforts lost dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing the flood. To this end he stationed himself at the
<div n="lb"/>bottom of the ocean, and allowed the point of the great
<div n="lb"/>mountain Mandara to be placed upon his back, which
<div n="lb"/>served as a hard axis, whereon the gods and demons,
<div n="lb"/>[Page831-b+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>with the serpent Vāsuki twisted round the mountain for
<div n="lb"/>a rope, churned the waters for the recovery of the
<div n="lb"/>amṛta or nectar, and fourteen other sacred things, {%see%}
<div n="lb"/>OCEAN. 3. The Varāha, or Boar. In this he descended
<div n="lb"/>in the form of a boar to rescue the earth from the
<div n="lb"/>power of a demon called ‘golden-eyed,’ Hiraṇyākṣa.
<div n="lb"/>This demon had seized on the earth and carried it with
<div n="lb"/>him into the depths of the ocean. Viṣṇu dived into
<div n="lb"/>the abyss, and, after a contest of a thousand years, slew
<div n="lb"/>the monster. 4. The Narasinha, or Man-lion. In this
<div n="lb"/>monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent
<div n="lb"/>demon called Hiraṇyakaśipu. 5. Vāmana, or Dwarf.
<div n="lb"/>This avatār happened in the second age of the Hindūs or
<div n="lb"/>Tretā yug, the four preceding are said to have occurred
<div n="lb"/>in the first or Satya yug; the object of this avatar
<div n="lb"/>was to trick Bali out of the dominion of the three worlds.
<div n="lb"/>Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he appeared
<div n="lb"/>before the king, and asked, as a boon, as much land as
<div n="lb"/>he could pace in three steps. This was granted; and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, immediately expanding himself till he filled the
<div n="lb"/>world, deprived Bali at two steps of heaven and earth,
<div n="lb"/>but in consideration of some merit, left Pātāla still in his
<div n="lb"/>dominion. 6. Paraśurāma. 7. Rāmachandra; for an
<div n="lb"/>account of both these, {%see%} RĀMA. 8. Kṛṣna, or, accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to some, Balarama, {%see%} KṚISHNA, RĀMA. 9. Buddha.
<div n="lb"/>In this avatār Viṣṇu descended in the form of a sage,
<div n="lb"/>for the purpose of making some reform in the religion
<div n="lb"/>of the Brahmins, and especially to reclaim them from
<div n="lb"/>their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindūs will not allow this to have been an incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of their favourite god. 10. Kalki, or White Horse.
<div n="lb"/>This is yet to come. Viṣṇu, mounted on a white
<div n="lb"/>horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet, will,
<div n="lb"/>according to prophecy, end this present age, viz. the
<div n="lb"/>fourth or Kali yug, by destroying the world, and then
<div n="lb"/>renovating creation by an era of purity. Many of the
<div n="lb"/>names of Vishnu correspond with those of Kṛṣna, who
<div n="lb"/>is by many identified with Viṣṇu, {%see%} KRISHNA. Some
