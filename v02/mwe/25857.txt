<div n="lb"/>SACRAMENT¦, {%s.%} {#saMskAraH, mahAyajYaH#}. For the twelve sanskāras or
<div n="lb"/>sacred symbolical rites, {%see%} RITE. The following are the
<div n="lb"/>five mahā-yajnas, or great sacraments of the Hindūs (as
<div n="lb"/>explained in Manu III. 70. {%et. seq.%}), appointed to be per-
<div n="lb"/>formed every day by the Grihastha, or house-keeper, for
<div n="lb"/>the sake of expiating the sin incurred by the involuntary
<div n="lb"/>destruction of minute living creatures. They refer re-
<div n="lb"/>spectively to what is due to five objects, viz. himself,
<div n="lb"/>the gods, his fore-fathers, spirits or ghosts, and men or
<div n="lb"/>guests. 1. Study of Scripture, with prayer and medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion, called {#brahmayajYaH#} or {#ahutaH#}. 2. Offering oblations to
<div n="lb"/>the gods in fire, called {#devayajYaH#} or {#hutaH#}. 3. Offering libations
<div n="lb"/>of water and cakes to the manes of deceased ancestors,
<div n="lb"/>called {#pitfyajYaH#} or {#prASitaM#} or {#SrAdDaM#}. 4. Casting the residue
<div n="lb"/>of oblations on the ground or in water, as an offering
<div n="lb"/>to spirits or goblins, called {#BUtayajYaH#} or {#baliyajYaH#} or {#prahutaH#} or
<div n="lb"/>{#AhutaH#} or {#baliH#} {%m.%} 5. Receiving guests, and especially
<div n="lb"/>Brahmans, with hospitality, called {#nfyajYaH#} or {#manuppayajYaH#} or
<div n="lb"/>{#brAhmyahutaM#} or {#brAhmyaM#} or {#brahmahutaM#}. The Viṣnu-Purāna adds two
<div n="lb"/>other sacraments, viz. ‘propagation of offspring,’ {#prajApatiyajYaH,#}
<div n="lb"/>and ‘observance of truth,’ {#satyayajYaH,#} but these are com-
<div n="lb"/>paratively modern additions. The Christian idea of a sa-
<div n="lb"/>crament may be expressed by {#saMskAraH#} or {#KrIzwaprakalpitasaMskAraH;#}
<div n="lb"/>as, ‘the sacrament of baptism,’ {#jalasaMskAraH#} or {#jalasecanasaMskAraH#}
<div n="lb"/>or {#majjanasaMskAraH;#} ‘of the Lord's Supper,’ {#KrIzwaBojanasaMskAraH#}
<div n="lb"/>or {#KrIzwamfnyuramaraRArTakasaMskAraH#}.
