{%Reṇukā%}¦ — a daughter of Reṇu (Suveṇu-{%Vā. P.%})
<div n="lb"/>and wife of Jamadagni; mother of Paraśurāma;<sup>1</sup> went
<div n="lb"/>once to the Ganges for a pot of water for {%homa%}
<div n="lb"/>purposes, saw the Gandharva king Citraratha play-
<div n="lb"/>ing with the Apsaras and forgot the time for return-
<div n="lb"/>ing home. Jamadagni understood her mind and in
<div n="lb"/>a rage asked his sons to kill her. All refused but Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma did it. Later as the result of the boon to his son who
<div n="lb"/>had pleased him by the act she came back to life. During
<div n="lb"/>the absence of Rāma, the sons of Arjuna (Haihaya) killed
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni in spite of Reṇukā's earnest protests.<sup>2</sup> On Rāma
<div n="lb"/>returning, she cried out beating 21 times on her breast;
<div n="lb"/>liked to die on the funeral pyre when she heard from the air
<div n="lb"/>that her husband would soon be alive. Though she desisted
<div n="lb"/>from it, she died unable to bear her husband's death.<sup>3</sup>
