{%Jagat-sṛṣṭi%}¦ — Evolution of Tattvas, etc. When the Śaktis
<div n="lb"/>did not attend to their function of creation, the Lord with
<div n="lb"/>Śaktikālā entered into twenty-three {%tattvas%} by dividing him-
<div n="lb"/>self into three parts — adhyātma, ādhidaiva, and ādhibhauma
<div n="lb"/>with tenfold prāṇa, Agni as his mouth, Varuṇa as tongue,
<div n="lb"/>Aśvins as nostrils, etc. Then came the four {%varṇas.%} At
<div n="lb"/>first five varieties of Ajñāna were created, viz., andhatāmisra,
<div n="lb"/>tāmisra, mahāmoha, moha, and tamas. Ashamed of these
<div n="lb"/>sinful creations, Brahmā created seers like Sanaka, Sananda,
<div n="lb"/>etc. They also did not proceed with the work of creation
<div n="lb"/>as was desired. So Brahmā grew angry and down came
<div n="lb"/>Rudra from the midst of his eye-brows. He was assigned
<div n="lb"/>places and women. Finding his creation intolerable, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>sent him away for penance, and produced ten mind-born
<div n="lb"/>sons, Maricī, Atri and others, and a daughter Sarasvatī. Then
<div n="lb"/>came the Vedas and other literature. Further the Creator's
<div n="lb"/>body got into two halves — one Svāyambhuva and the other
<div n="lb"/>Śatarūpa. These were parents of two sons and three
<div n="lb"/>daughters. Their descendants filled up the whole of the
<div n="lb"/>earth. Another account of creation.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. III. 5. 27-36; 6. (whole); 12. (whole); 20. 12 ff.
