{%Bāhu%} (II)¦ — a son of Dhṛtaka (Vṛka-{%Vi. P.%}); was
<div n="lb"/>attacked and deprived of his kingdom by the Haihayas and
<div n="lb"/>the Tālajanghas with the help of the Śakas, Yavanas, Kām-
<div n="lb"/>bojas, Pāradas, and Palhavas, the five tribes; hence the king
<div n="lb"/>abdicated and took to a life of penance with his wife in the
<div n="lb"/>forest as an old man. Once he went to bring water when
<div n="lb"/>he slipped into the waters and died; his wife Yādavī followed
<div n="lb"/>him though she was in the family way; she had been
<div n="lb"/>poisoned by her co-wife to prevent pregnancy; she got into
<div n="lb"/>the funeral pyre. Aurva, the Bhārgava withdrew her from
<div n="lb"/>the fire; she was in his {%āśrama%} and brought forth Sagara
<div n="lb"/>(Saha Gara).
