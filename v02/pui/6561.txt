{%Dharmamūrti%}¦ — a king in the Bṛhatkalpa; a friend of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. His wife was Bhānumatī. He had the prowess to
<div n="lb"/>vanquish even the Asuras. Asked as to the reason of his
<div n="lb"/>strength, his Purohita, Vasiṣṭha explained that in the
<div n="lb"/>previous birth he was a goldsmith in the service of a Śaivite
<div n="lb"/>courtesan, Līlāvatī. She performed the gift of Lavanācala
<div n="lb"/>when he helped her in making up the salt mountain in gold
<div n="lb"/>without receiving anything as wages. The present position
<div n="lb"/>was its consequence. Then he made gifts of ten Merus to
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha.
