{%Pūru%} (III)¦ — a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā; agreed to
<div n="lb"/>exchange his youth for his father's old age for a stipulated
<div n="lb"/>period of 1000 years; got back his youth and was anointed
<div n="lb"/>king; progenitor of the Paurava vamśa; father of Janame-
<div n="lb"/>jaya; in his line were Brahmanas, Kṣatriyas and the Bha-
<div n="lb"/>ratas; blessed by Yayātī to have good sons; a legal point was
<div n="lb"/>raised by the members of the Assembly as to the legality
<div n="lb"/>of his succession to the throne when there was the eldest,
<div n="lb"/>Yadu, the grandson of Śukra; Yayāti explained that mere
<div n="lb"/>birth was no qualification for it was character that counted;
<div n="lb"/>the conduct of the eldest son was unsatisfactory and hence
<div n="lb"/>the youngest was chosen; this was approved by the Paura-
[Page2-375+ 30]
<div n="lb"/>jānapadas;<sup>1</sup> as an obedient son his consecration was accepted
<div n="lb"/>by the people though he was young; his kingdom was the
<div n="lb"/>territory between the Ganges and the Yamunā; his brothers
<div n="lb"/>were the lords of the frontiers.<sup>2</sup> His line ends with Bahu-
<div n="lb"/>ratha.<sup>3</sup>
