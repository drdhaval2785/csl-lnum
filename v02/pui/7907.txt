{%Pitṛsarga%}¦ — once the whole world was covered with
<div n="lb"/>darkness; there were no air, no earth, no planets, no direc-
<div n="lb"/>tions, no sun, no moon, no days or nights; the single Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>out of tapoyoga created worlds of Vedas and other devas;
<div n="lb"/>there were seven classes of which three had no form and
<div n="lb"/>four had forms: Devas and earth and rains; then śrāddhas.
<div n="P"/>Vā. 71. 37, 57 and 65.
