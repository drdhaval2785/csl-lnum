{%Gopi%}¦ — (girls) see Kātyāyani vrata. The gopi women
<div n="lb"/>were enchanted by the music of Kṛṣṇa, took to Brindāvana,
<div n="lb"/>and worshipped him. By singing his glories and through
<div n="lb"/>{%Kāma%} they became one with Him.<sup>1</sup> On another occasion
<div n="lb"/>they were so much moved by his music that they left their
<div n="lb"/>household work, children and male members and came to
<div n="lb"/>Brindāvan. Though they were asked to go back they
<div n="lb"/>refused, and desired to attain His feet. While they were
<div n="lb"/>enjoying his presence, Kṛṣṇa suddenly disappeared. They
<div n="lb"/>wandered all the forest in search of Him, addressing all trees
<div n="lb"/>and plants as to his whereabouts. During all this time each
<div n="lb"/>thought that every one of them was Kṛṣṇa and imitated his
<div n="lb"/>boyish exploits. After vain search they came to the very
<div n="lb"/>place wherefrom they started and meditated on his great-
<div n="lb"/>ness. They praised him in the form of {%gītam%} looking for-
<div n="lb"/>ward to his arrival. Soon he was in their midst and con-
<div n="lb"/>soled them. They took part in the {%rāsa krīḍa%} where was
<div n="lb"/>seen a Kṛṣṇa between every two women. They sang and
<div n="lb"/>danced unconscious of the loosening of their jewels, braid
<div n="lb"/>or clothes. When they sweated in fatigue, Kṛṣṇa wiped off
<div n="lb"/>their sweat. They then enjoyed water-sports, and sports on
<div n="lb"/>the river-banks in the {%upavana.%} By dawn they repaired to
<div n="lb"/>their homes.<sup>2</sup> When some gopis were forcibly taken by
<div n="lb"/>Śankha Cūda, Kṛṣṇa released them and killed him.<sup>3</sup> When
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa was away in the woods, the gopis who were at homes
<div n="lb"/>sang in praise of his {%veṇu gītā.%}<sup>4</sup> Gopis heard of Kṛṣṇa going
<div n="lb"/>to Mathrā with Akrūra and characterised Akrūra to
<div n="lb"/>be only a Krūra as he brought about Kṛṣṇa's sepa-
<div n="lb"/>ration from them. They turned their minds on the past
<div n="lb"/>deeds of Kṛṣṇa, and stood motionless as pictures at his leav-
[Page1-550+ 31]
<div n="lb"/>ing them. Kṛṣṇa assured them of his return soon.<sup>5</sup> Uddhava
<div n="lb"/>was sent by Kṛṣṇa with a message to gopis and gopas. The
<div n="lb"/>gopis mistook his chariot for that of Akrūra. They all sur-
<div n="lb"/>rounded him and enquired of Kṛṣṇa and his attitude towards
<div n="lb"/>them. Uddhava brought relief to them by delivering Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>message while they recounted to him his deeds at Brindā-
<div n="lb"/>van. Pleased at their attachment to the Lord, Uddhava took
<div n="lb"/>leave of them after spending some time there.<sup>6</sup> They went
<div n="lb"/>to Syamantapañcaka and met Kṛṣṇa who took them aside
<div n="lb"/>and consoled them so much so that they were all in contem-
<div n="lb"/>plation of Him. Left for Mathurā.<sup>7</sup> and attained salvation
