{%Nalakūbara%}¦ — a son of Kubera and Ṛddhi; as an
<div n="lb"/>attendant of Rudra became very proud and with his brother
<div n="lb"/>Maṇigrīva enjoyed maidens' embrace on the Ganges, all
<div n="lb"/>naked. Nārada saw this when the ladies put on their dress
<div n="lb"/>while Nalakūbara and his brother continued to remain nak-
<div n="lb"/>ed owing to their drunkenness. The sage cursed them to
<div n="lb"/>become trees for a hundred divine years without losing the
<div n="lb"/>{%Pūrvavāsana.%} So they stood till Kṛṣṇa redeemed them by
<div n="lb"/>bringing down the trees; their prayer to Kṛṣṇa; set out to
<div n="lb"/>the north, permitted by Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 9. 22. 23; 10. (whole); Br. III. 8. 46. Vā. 70. 41.
