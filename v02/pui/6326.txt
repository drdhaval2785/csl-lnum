{%De(ai)vāsura Yuddha%}¦ — consequent on the Asuras not
<div n="lb"/>obtaining Amṛta for all their labours in the Amṛtamathana,
<div n="lb"/>war broke out. It was on the seashore and mainly a hand-
<div n="lb"/>to-hand fight; description of; at last Indra invoked Hari, who
<div n="lb"/>appeared on the scene and on him Kālanemi flung his śūla;
<div n="lb"/>with the same weapon Hari flung him down; so also Mālya-
<div n="lb"/>van, Māli and Sumāli were put to death. Fight continued
<div n="lb"/>till Nārada stopped it.<sup>1</sup> Twelve in number, after which the
<div n="lb"/>whole earth and {%yajña%} came over to the Devas.<sup>2</sup> Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras slain by Hari, Diti went to the earth and
<div n="lb"/>performed {%Madanadvādaśi vratam%} to get able bodied
<div n="lb"/>sons to kill Indra;<sup>3</sup> one, of three hundred years between
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Prahlāda. Indra with the help of Raji, a
<div n="lb"/>son of Āyu vanquished him.<sup>4</sup> Asuras under Hrāda
<div n="lb"/>vanquished the Gods after the battle which continued
<div n="lb"/>for a hundred divine years. The gods withdrew
<div n="lb"/>to the north of the milky ocean and prayed to Viṣṇu for suc-
<div n="lb"/>cour. The latter deluded the Asuras in {%Māyāmoha%} form
<div n="lb"/>and the Asuras were defeated.<sup>5</sup>
