{%Śeṣa%} (II)¦ — (Ananta): a tāmasa form of Viṣṇu down
<div n="lb"/>below the Pātāla regions; with 1000 jewelled heads, purple
<div n="lb"/>garment, white necklace; in his hands are the plough and
<div n="lb"/>mace; worshipped by Lakṣmī and Vāruṇī; when the deluge
<div n="lb"/>sets in, he vomits venomed fire devouring the three worlds;
<div n="lb"/>Nāga maids adorn him with fragrant sandal paste; celestials
<div n="lb"/>and Asuras worship him; Gangā worshipped him and learnt
<div n="lb"/>from him astronomy and astrology; supports the whole earth
<div n="lb"/>with his head;<sup>1</sup> the best of Nāgas;<sup>2</sup> is Balarāma.<sup>3</sup>
