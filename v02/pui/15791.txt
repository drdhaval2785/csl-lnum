{%Sāmba%} (I)¦ — a son of Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī; reincarna-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Guha;<sup>1</sup> attended Aniruddha's marriage at Bhojakaṭa,
<div n="lb"/>went with the Vṛṣṇi army to Bāṇa's city and fought with the
<div n="lb"/>son of Bāṇa;<sup>2</sup> went out to play and saw a huge lizard in a
<div n="lb"/>well and reported it to Kṛṣṇa;<sup>3</sup> took Lakṣmaṇā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana in a svayamvara. The Kurus imprisoned him.
<div n="lb"/>Afraid of Balarāma's prowess, was released by Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana and was given dowry. Went to Dvārakā after the
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira and defended the city against Śālva.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Went to Syamantapañcaka for the solar eclipse.<sup>5</sup> Went with
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's sacrificial horse. Fought with Pradyumna at Pra-
<div n="lb"/>bhāsa.<sup>6</sup> Disguised as a pregnant lady by Yadu youths for fun,
<div n="lb"/>approached a sage and asked him whether she would deliver a
<div n="lb"/>male child. In anger the sage said that she would give birth
<div n="lb"/>to a {%musala%} (iron rod) which would be death to the Yadu kula.
<div n="lb"/>Divested of his attire, the {%musala%} was seen; causing distress
<div n="lb"/>to the Yadus. The king ordered that it must be powdered
<div n="lb"/>and thrown into the deep. A bit that was left unpowdered
<div n="lb"/>was swallowed by a fish which was caught by a fisherman.
<div n="lb"/>The latter fixed it at the tip of his arrow. The particles of
<div n="lb"/>the {%musala%} were thrown ashore and grew to be {%eraka%} grass.<sup>7</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Kāśī; one of the five vamśavīras;<sup>8</sup> married Kaśyā, daughter of

<div n="lb"/>with divine sparks;<sup>9</sup> was looked upon with love by the 16000
[Page3-587+ 25]
<div n="lb"/>women of Kṛṣṇa and hence they were cursed by Kṛṣṇa to

<div n="lb"/>the curse by observing {%anaṅgadāna vratam%} as prescribed by
<div n="lb"/>Dālbhya, the sage.<sup>10</sup> Got killed in the Yādava struggle at Pra-
<div n="lb"/>bhāsa.<sup>11</sup>
