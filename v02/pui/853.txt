{%Arjuna%}¦ (I) {%(Kārtavīrya)%} — son of Kṛtavīrya. Lord of
<div n="lb"/>seven islands and of Haihayaṣ, {%Samrāṭ%} and {%Cakravartin.%}
<div n="lb"/>By the grace of Hari he got 1000 arms and enjoyed {%aṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%aiśvaryas.%} Learnt the merit of {%yoga%} from Dattātreya. Ruled
<div n="lb"/>in peace for 85,000 years<sup>1</sup> and was ambitious to have more
<div n="lb"/>territorial possessions.<sup>2</sup> Was engaged in water-sports with
<div n="lb"/>women wearing the garland of Vaijayanti.<sup>3</sup> Imprisoned
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa in his capital Māhiṣmatī and released him on an
<div n="lb"/>appeal from Pulasya.<sup>4</sup> In the course of a hunting expedi-
<div n="lb"/>tion, he came to the hermitage of Jamadagni who enter-
<div n="lb"/>tained him with the help of his Kāmadhenu. The king,
<div n="lb"/>envious of the sage's prosperity, desired its possession, and
<div n="lb"/>on being refused by the sage, he took the cow by force.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Parasurāma who was away, heard the story on his return,
<div n="lb"/>went to Arjuna's capital, cut off his head with his axe after
<div n="lb"/>a terrible battle in which Matsyarāja took part and
<div n="lb"/>recovered the cow and the calf.<sup>6</sup> Jamadagni regretted his
<div n="lb"/>son's action as the king was a {%Naradeva,%} and killing him
<div n="lb"/>was an offence greater than brāhmanicide.<sup>7</sup> Had 1000 (?)
<div n="lb"/>sons, (100 sons) all of whom except five died in battles.
<div n="lb"/>These sons killed Jamadagni when Rāma and his brothers
<div n="lb"/>were gone out.<sup>8</sup> These five were great warriors.<sup>9</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>minister was the evil Candragupta and the {%Purohita,%}
<div n="lb"/>Garga.<sup>10</sup> Incarnation of Viṣṇu Cakra;<sup>11</sup> to his family
<div n="lb"/>belonged Tālajaṅgha;<sup>12</sup> performed thousands of {%yajñas%} with
<div n="lb"/>golden {%yūpas%} and {%vedis,%} which were attended by gods. A
<div n="lb"/>Rājaṛṣi, paśupāla, kṣetrapāla.<sup>13</sup> Defeated Karkoṭaka's son at
<div n="lb"/>Māhiṣmatī and established his city on the banks of the Nar-
<div n="lb"/>madā. Could control the waters of the Narmadā and
<div n="lb"/>the fury of the ocean: a terror to Asuras in Pātāla as also
<div n="lb"/>to Rākṣasas and Uragas. Defeated Rāvaṇa and released
[Page1-107+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>him at the intervention of Pulastya: burnt down the Hema-
<div n="lb"/>tālavanam, residence of Āpava and was cursed that a Bhār-
<div n="lb"/>gava and a Brāhmaṇa would chop off his 1000 hands.<sup>14</sup> A
<div n="lb"/>{%gātha%} in his honour by Nārada.<sup>14(a</sup> Once Āditya in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a Brāhmaṇa asked to be fed at the expense of all im-

<div n="lb"/>{%Saubhāgyaśayana-vratam%} and made the 16 gifts.<sup>16</sup>
