{%Sarga%} (II)¦ — the order of creation; a form of Brahman
<div n="lb"/>known as Puruṣa and Kṣetrajña with the aid of Pradhāna
<div n="lb"/>originated mahat tatva out of which was born ahamkāra;
<div n="lb"/>engaged further in creation, the creator engendered the rudi-
<div n="lb"/>ment of sound (śabdatanmātṛkam) from which was pro-
<div n="lb"/>duced, ākāśa or ether; it was invested with śabda or sound;
<div n="lb"/>then was created Vāyu, invested with the rudiment of
<div n="lb"/>touch, fire invested with the rudiment of rūpa or form,
<div n="lb"/>waters invested with the rudiment of taste; and lastly an
<div n="lb"/>aggregate of all this (earth) originates, of which smell is
<div n="lb"/>the property; those rudimental elements are designated
<div n="lb"/>aviśeṣas or devoid of qualities and this goes by the name of
<div n="lb"/>elemental creation; from ahamkāra are again produced the
<div n="lb"/>ten organs of sense and the ten divinities along with the
<div n="lb"/>eleventh, mind. These several elements could not by them-
<div n="lb"/>selves produce and therefore there was a blending; and the
<div n="lb"/>result of this compound was the formation of an egg-like
<div n="lb"/>aṇḍa, where figures the Lord in vyakta rūpa; its womb being
<div n="lb"/>Meru and its water being the oceans containing all worlds,
<div n="lb"/>Gods and men, surrounded outside by seven envelopes like
<div n="lb"/>elements of fire, water etc.; first was one of darkness of five
<div n="lb"/>Parvas: darkness, illusion, blindness, ignorance, and of no
<div n="lb"/>light; three prākṛta sargas — {%mahata, bhūta,%} and {%aindri-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yaka;%} three Vaikṛta sargas — {%mukhya sarga, Tairyakyoni,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%deva sarga arvāksrotasa%} and {%anugraha sarga;%} the ninth
[Page3-557+ 27]
<div n="lb"/>sarga was named {%Kaumāra;%} then came the creation of devās,
<div n="lb"/>asuras, pitṛs and men.
