{%Umā%} (I)¦ — worshipped for a happy family.<sup>1</sup> Her splen-
<div n="lb"/>dour.<sup>2</sup> Also known as Ambikā; also Rudrāṇī.<sup>3</sup> In the forest
<div n="lb"/>of Sukumāra.<sup>4</sup> Consort of Śiva, also Gaurī; originally
<div n="lb"/>Dākṣāyanī, daughter of Menā and Himavān. Original name
<div n="lb"/>Aparṇā. Her garden: a śakti:<sup>5</sup> The world of: {%Adhidevatā%}
<div n="lb"/>for the planet Soma.<sup>6</sup> Festivities at her birth.<sup>7</sup> Going with
<div n="lb"/>her father to Śiva's house, they met Rati weeping on the
<div n="lb"/>way. She said that Śiva had burnt down her husband. On
<div n="lb"/>this Umā's father did not like the idea of giving his daughter
<div n="lb"/>to such an ill-tempered person. Umā requested permis-
<div n="lb"/>sion to do penance and was allowed. Indra at this time
<div n="lb"/>thought of the seven sages to bring about Śiva's marriage
<div n="lb"/>with Umā. The sages were satisfied of her steadfast love
<div n="lb"/>to Śiva and had his consent for the marriage; celestial
<div n="lb"/>women dressed Umā, as also the god Śiva; amidst divine
<div n="lb"/>music, the couple went to the city of Mahāgirinagara and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā officiated as priest: After the marriage they left for
<div n="lb"/>Mandaragiri.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Once Umā made a doll with elephant face and dropped it
<div n="lb"/>in the Ganges. It became a huge figure and was claimed
<div n="lb"/>as son by Umā and the Ganges respectively.<sup>9</sup> Then Umā
[Page1-239+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>grew a tender Aśoka plant when Bṛhaspati and others told
<div n="lb"/>her that she would have a real son and that trees and dolls
<div n="lb"/>were no satisfaction;<sup>10</sup> once she heard a yell of noise and
<div n="lb"/>was told of the play engaged in by Gaṇas, and then her
<div n="lb"/>eyes attracted Vīraka. She expressed to Śiva for a son like
<div n="lb"/>Vīraka. Śiva asked her to have him as her child. He was
<div n="lb"/>sent for and nursed by Umā.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Touched by Goddess of Night, she became black in
<div n="lb"/>colour. Śiva found fault with her and after reproaching
<div n="lb"/>him with his past deeds, she left him for penance. Vīraka
<div n="lb"/>appealed to her when she said she would return as Gaurī.
<div n="lb"/>She asked Vīraka to see that no lady entered her harem.
<div n="lb"/>Meanwhile Āḍi, son of Andhakāsura entered Śiva's abode
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of Umā but was slain by Śiva. Hearing from
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu that a lady entered her home, she cursed Vīraka to
<div n="lb"/>be born on the earth; out of her rage came out a lion which
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā gave to the Goddess of Night, who was asked to
<div n="lb"/>leave Umā for the Vindhya hills. Now Umā became Gaurī
<div n="lb"/>and entered Śiva's abode when Vīraka stopped her, as he
<div n="lb"/>did not at first recognise her. Convinced of his mother's
<div n="lb"/>identity, he requested her to recall her curse and was
<div n="lb"/>assured of a place in Devagaṇa.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>While Umā was sporting with Śiva, Agni entered the
<div n="lb"/>harem in the form of a parrot. Noticing this Umā left the
<div n="lb"/>bed and Śiva made Agni drink his {%vīrya.%} Out of the scat-
<div n="lb"/>tered {%vīrya,%} there sprang up a beautiful pond where the six
<div n="lb"/>Pleiades bathed and took water in a lotus leaf. Blessed by
<div n="lb"/>them the Devī got the {%garbha%} and out of her left side came
<div n="lb"/>out Subrahmaṇya.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>Going through the {%Udyānam%} again Śiva spoke to her
<div n="lb"/>of the greatness of Benares.<sup>14</sup> Satī in previous birth.<sup>15</sup>
