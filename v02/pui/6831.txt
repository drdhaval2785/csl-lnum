{%Nanda(gopa)%} (IV)¦ — In previous birth the Vasu, Droṇa;<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>connected with the Devas, married Yaśodā;<sup>2</sup> celebrated the
<div n="lb"/>birth of Kṛṣṇa as his son by inviting Brahmanas, Gopas and
<div n="lb"/>Gopīs and making rich presents to them, the Gopas and
<div n="lb"/>Gopīs threw balls of turmeric on the baby and sprinkled
<div n="lb"/>butter, curds and milk on one another, a folk custom;<sup>3</sup> went
<div n="lb"/>to Mathurā to pay the annual tribute to Kamsa; was met
<div n="lb"/>by Vasudeva who advised him to leave at once for his place
<div n="lb"/>as he expected some {%utpātas%} there: Nanda thinking Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>deva's words to be true turned his thoughts on the way to
<div n="lb"/>Hari; heard of Pūtanā, the demon killed by Kṛṣṇa and felt
<div n="lb"/>greatly surprised; embraced Kṛṣṇa in joy; performed {%Śānti%}
<div n="lb"/>for Kṛṣṇa for kicking the cart; was surprised at Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>taking the lap of Tṛṇāvarta and believed more and more in
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva's words; welcomed Garga and had {%nāmakaraṇa%}
<div n="lb"/>done to his sons; became pleased at Garga's service;<sup>3</sup> Nanda
<div n="lb"/>and his friends bewildered at the fall of the Arjuna trees
<div n="lb"/>and released Kṛṣṇa from his fetters; planned to leave Vraja
<div n="lb"/>for Brindāvana;<sup>4</sup> his fortune in enjoying Hari at close
<div n="lb"/>quarters;<sup>5</sup> was much concerned at the bad omens at Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>fight with Kāliya; was stopped by Balarāma from entering
<div n="lb"/>the port of Kāliya; joy at Kṛṣṇa's escape from Kāliya; gave
<div n="lb"/>presents of gold and cows to Brahmanas on the occasion.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-195+ 43]
<div n="P"/>Prepared for the Indrayāga; but gave it up and prayed
<div n="lb"/>to the mountains instead, as advised by Kṛṣṇa; Indra's anger
<div n="lb"/>towards Nanda; was surprised at Kṛṣṇa holding the Govar-
<div n="lb"/>dhana; when the Gopas wondered at the exploits of the boy,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, Nanda said that he heard from Garga that he was
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva's son and an {%amśa%} of Nārāyaṇa; after fasting on
<div n="lb"/>{%ekādaśi,%} Nanda went to Yamunā for bath for the {%dvādaśi;%}
<div n="lb"/>it was āsura time and not the time for bath; so an Asura
<div n="lb"/>follower of Varuṇa took hold of him and placed him before
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa; seeing Nanda missing, the Gopas got frightened and
<div n="lb"/>appealed to Kṛṣṇa who went to Varuṇa; pleased at seeing
<div n="lb"/>him Varuṇa said that it was a mistake committed by his
<div n="lb"/>servants in ignorance and set Nanda free; then he returned
<div n="lb"/>to Vraja to the great joy of all the Gopas; taken to Brahmah-
<div n="lb"/>rada;<sup>7</sup> when once he went to Ambikāvana he was seized by
<div n="lb"/>a reptile and was released with Kṛṣṇa's help.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Extended a hearty welcome to Akrūra and enquired of
<div n="lb"/>Kamsa; became afraid of Akrūra's message; got ready with
<div n="lb"/>all the Gopas to start for Mathurā with presents to Kamsa;
<div n="lb"/>followed Akrūra's chariot with all his carts and men; came
<div n="lb"/>in advance and waited for Kṛṣṇa's arrival; took his seat
<div n="lb"/>along with the other Gopas in the gallery of the wrestling
<div n="lb"/>ground; Kamsa desired to imprison him; duly honoured by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, Nanda and the Gopas returned to Vraja after Kamsa's
<div n="lb"/>death;<sup>9</sup> welcomed Uddhava with due honour; exhibited his
<div n="lb"/>deep love for Kṛṣṇa; Uddhava revealed the real nature of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to him.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Came to Syamantapañcaka and met Kṛṣṇa and others;
<div n="lb"/>embraced and enquired after by Vasudeva and others;<sup>11</sup> was
<div n="lb"/>honoured by Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, Ugrasena and Vasudeva; spent
<div n="lb"/>three months unwilling to be away from the Yadus, left for
