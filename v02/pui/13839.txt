<div n="lb"/>the vilest of creatures; Pannaga. ety. creeping on the ground;
<div n="lb"/>sarpa, from escaping or fleeting nature; all have their abode
<div n="lb"/>in the earth under the sun and moon; out of anger came viṣa
<div n="lb"/>or poison; then airy beings were created; cūṭas, piśācas from
<div n="lb"/>eating flesh, Gandharvas sucking cows.
