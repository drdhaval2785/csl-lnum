{%Jvālā%} (II)¦ — after the conquest of the three worlds by
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, the Devas, including Brahmā praised him; Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>was the creator while Viṣṇu was the creator and destroyer
<div n="lb"/>of worlds; during their discussion there was a {%jvālā%} in the
<div n="lb"/>north which spread over all the worlds out of which came
<div n="lb"/>Linga which went on growing. To see its beginning and
<div n="lb"/>end both agreed to go above and below respectively; they
<div n="lb"/>went on for 1000 years; it was beyond reckoning; hence both
<div n="lb"/>praised Śiva for light; Śiva said that Brahmā was the right
<div n="lb"/>hand and Viṣṇu his left hand and disappeared.
