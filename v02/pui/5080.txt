{%Jarāsandha%} (I)¦ — born to Bṛhadratha in two parts and
<div n="lb"/>cast away by the mother. Jarā (s.v.) joined them together,
<div n="lb"/>saying in sport ‘Live, Live’. It was Jarāsandha. He was
<div n="lb"/>father of Sahadeva.<sup>1</sup> King of Magadha and father-in-law of
<div n="lb"/>Kamśā who married his daughters Asti and Prāpti; acted as
<div n="lb"/>Kamśā's guru in his wicked plans. Heard of Kamśā's death
<div n="lb"/>from his widowed daughters and resolved to destroy all
<div n="lb"/>the Yādavas. He besieged Mathurā with twenty-three {%akṣau-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%hinis,%} stationing at the four gates king of Kalinga and
<div n="lb"/>others. Drums were sounded as a call to arms. Told Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>that he was a boy unfit to fight him and asked Rāma to meet
<div n="lb"/>him in battle. Rāma challenged him on the western gate.
<div n="lb"/>Finding all his army followers killed, Jarāsandha attacked
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. When the latter was about to bind him with ropes,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa asked that he be set free. Jarāsandha went home
<div n="lb"/>greatly distressed. Three months after, Jarāsandha collected
[Page1-640+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>another huge army of twenty-three {%akṣauhinis,%} encamped at
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā banks and slept that night. Kṛṣṇa divided his
<div n="lb"/>army into three divisions and attacked the enemy on all
<div n="lb"/>sides by surprise. All Jarāsandha's followers took to flight
<div n="lb"/>leaving all their belongings which were presented to Ugra-
<div n="lb"/>sena.
<div n="P"/>Then he called on Bāṇa at his city Śoṇitapura soliciting
<div n="lb"/>his help against the Yadus. Bāṇa's welcome and offer to help;
<div n="lb"/>with this force he again besieged Mathurā. Fight between
<div n="lb"/>him and Rāma. Defeat of Kumbhāṇḍa and retreat of Kūpa-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa and other soldiers of Bāṇa to their city. Jarāsan-
<div n="lb"/>dha's return to the city.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Felt angry at Śṛgāla's end and led another expedition
<div n="lb"/>to Mathurā. Defeat and return. In this way he led seven-
<div n="lb"/>teen expeditions. During the eighteenth expedition a cer-
<div n="lb"/>tain Yavana sent by Nārada besieged the city.<sup>3</sup> Jarāsandha
<div n="lb"/>attacked the Yadus going to Dvārakā after vanquishing the
<div n="lb"/>{%mlecchas%} by the formation of {%Makaravyūha%} when Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>destroyed it by throwing a big tree on it. Rāma also gave
<div n="lb"/>them mighty blows. Then he turned upon two brothers who
<div n="lb"/>were unarmed and who ran to Pravarṣaṇa hill. Jarāsandha
<div n="lb"/>followed them and burnt the hill by besieging it from all
<div n="lb"/>sides. The brothers leaped into the plains and regained
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā, but were taken by their enemies to be burnt dead.
<div n="lb"/>His defeat at Kṛṣṇa's hands during the {%svayamvara%} of Ruk-
<div n="lb"/>miṇī is mentioned. Arrival at Kuṇḍina; went to Śiśupāla
<div n="lb"/>and comforted him that all was due to fate, and returned to
<div n="lb"/>his city.<sup>4</sup> His defeats were recalled by Kṛtavarman.<sup>5</sup> He
<div n="lb"/>had his capital at Girivraja, where thousands of kings were
<div n="lb"/>kept imprisoned.<sup>6</sup> A preliminary to Yudhiṣṭhīra's {%rājasūya%}
<div n="lb"/>was to kill Jarāsandha. Finding him unconquered and also
<div n="lb"/>devoted to Brahmaṇas, Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna went to
<div n="lb"/>him in Brahmana's guise and asked for meals. Jarāsandha
<div n="lb"/>understood them to be Kṣatriyas and still recalled Bali giv-
<div n="lb"/>ing the earth to Hari in a Brahmana's guise. So he offered
<div n="lb"/>to give his head. Then Kṛṣṇa and his two friends revealed
<div n="lb"/>themselves and invited him to battle. He refused to fight a
[Page1-641+ 25]
<div n="lb"/>coward who left Mathurā for a sea-girt-city, nor with un-
<div n="lb"/>equal Arjuna. But he agreed to fight with Bhīma. Then
<div n="lb"/>battle continued for 27 days and Bhīma felt despondent.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa gave him a hint by tearing a twig behind. So Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>pulled him down and tore him to two pieces from head to
<div n="lb"/>foot.<sup>7</sup> One of those who failed to hit the fish in the {%svayam-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vara%} of Lakṣmaṇā.<sup>8</sup>
