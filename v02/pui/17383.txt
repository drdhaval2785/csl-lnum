{%Hiraṇyakaśipu%} (I)¦ — a son of Ditī and Kaśyapa: reduc-
<div n="lb"/>ed to subjection the three worlds with the Lokapālas: secured
<div n="lb"/>heaven through his son Prahlāda. His queen was Kayādhu;<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>wanted to avenge his brother Hiraṇyākṣa's death;<sup>2</sup> the six
<div n="lb"/>sons born of his Asura Yoni were carried off by Yogamāyā's
<div n="lb"/>effort. They were again born of Devakī and killed by
<div n="lb"/>Kamsa;<sup>3</sup> lust after more territory;<sup>4</sup> in his previous birth an
<div n="lb"/>attendant of Hari. He was next born as Rāvaṇa and after-
<div n="lb"/>wards Caidya. Destroyed the whole world by fire and by
<div n="lb"/>sword all friends of Hari for the killing of his brother, consol-
<div n="lb"/>ed his wife and sons pointing to the old saying that to die at
<div n="lb"/>the hands of an enemy leads one to heaven and cited the story
<div n="lb"/>of Suyajña that it was no use to weep over the dead body.
<div n="lb"/>Then Ditī set her mind on the truth;<sup>5</sup> Hiraṇyakaśipu began
<div n="lb"/>austere penance in the Mandara hill and the fire of his
<div n="lb"/>penance spread far and wide and created fear in the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā paid a visit and saw Hiraṇyakaśipu covered by an
<div n="lb"/>ant hill. Sprinkling divine waters, he woke him up to see the
<div n="lb"/>Lord on the Swan, and he praised His glory. He asked that
<div n="lb"/>(1) he might not meet with death at the hands of any being
[Page3-770+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>created by Brahmā; (2) might not meet with death inside or
<div n="lb"/>outside, by day or night, by any weapon not on earth or in sky,
<div n="lb"/>by men or beasts, gods or asuras; (3) he was to be without
<div n="lb"/>an equal; (4) he should possess undiminishing power (5) and
<div n="lb"/>be the one ruler of all creatures.<sup>6</sup> These were granted and
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu spread his sway on all the worlds and took up
<div n="lb"/>the seat of Indra. All gods except the Triad bowed to him;<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>father of four sons, chief of whom was Prahlāda whom he
<div n="lb"/>hated as he was a devotee of Hari. Śukra's sons Śaṇḍa and
<div n="lb"/>Marka were appointed to be his tutors to get a knowledge
<div n="lb"/>of Trivarga. This only increased Prahlāda's devotion.
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu put it to some inborn defect of the boy. Means
<div n="lb"/>to kill the child by wild beasts, poison, fire and water were
<div n="lb"/>of no avail. He was bound by noose and imprisoned;<sup>8</sup> when
<div n="lb"/>he was absent in Mandara hill Indra harassed his followers
<div n="lb"/>and captured his queen with Prahlāda. Nārada asked
<div n="lb"/>him to release her, which he did. She was under the custody
<div n="lb"/>of the sage, praying to him for the birth of a good son;<sup>9</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>the course of his father's (Kaśyapa's) aśvamedha sacrifice, the
<div n="lb"/>child Hiraṇyakaśipu sat on one of the golden seats reserved
<div n="lb"/>for Hotṛ, and hence the name. Ruled for nearly (1/4) of the
<div n="lb"/>manvantara, got aurvimāyā from Aurva to dispel;<sup>10</sup> Tāmaśi-
<div n="lb"/>māyā;<sup>11</sup> rivers, mountains, worlds, etc. shaken by him;<sup>12</sup> first
<div n="lb"/>of Daityas, killed by Narasimha whom he never considered
<div n="lb"/>as Viṣṇu;<sup>13</sup> taken out by action of Yoganidrā under orders
<div n="lb"/>from Viṣṇu.<sup>14</sup>
