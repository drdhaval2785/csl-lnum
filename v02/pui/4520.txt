{%Cakrarajarathendra%}¦ — Śrīcakra? Nine sections are dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinguished. In the ninth {%parva%} (section) are ten presiding
<div n="lb"/>deities — the siddhi devis. In a part of this {%parva%} were
<div n="lb"/>stationed the eight Śaktis. Above them were the ten Mudā-
<div n="lb"/>devis or Prakaṭaśaktis. In the eighth {%parva%} there were six-
<div n="lb"/>teen Śaktis named Guptas. In the seventh {%parva%} were six
<div n="lb"/>guptatarās with sugarcane bow, flower dart and flower balls.
<div n="lb"/>In the sixth {%parva%} were the twelve ājñāśaktis. In the fifth
<div n="lb"/>were ten Kulottīrṇa śaktis. In the fourth were ten Nigar-
[Page1-572+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>bhayogini śaktis. In the third were the eight Rahasya-
<div n="lb"/>yogini śaktis. In the second were her favourites three in
<div n="lb"/>number. Where this was, there was Geyaratha and where
<div n="lb"/>the latter was, there was {%kiricakra.%} These three looked like
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds or like the three mountains namely the
<div n="lb"/>Meru, Mandara and the Vindhyas. Lalitā was cakrarāja.
<div n="lb"/>There were six charioteers. Ten yojanas in length, covered
<div n="lb"/>by an umbrella of that height as indication of Lalitā's sām-
<div n="lb"/>rājyam. In the other two, rather ordinary umbrellas were
<div n="lb"/>seen. Viṣaṅga came from rear in disguise, protected by
<div n="lb"/>Kāmeśvarī, the Nityas, Aṇimas and other deities in its ninth
<div n="lb"/>{%parva.%} Kutilākṣa attacked in front. The Nityas kill-
<div n="lb"/>ed all the 15 commanders of Viṣaṅga who fled for
<div n="lb"/>life. This was directed towards the Mahendra hill,
<div n="lb"/>itself in the middle; on its left and right sides the
<div n="lb"/>chariots of Daṇḍiṇi and Śyāmala, rear Sarupadevi and
<div n="lb"/>front Hayāsana: at the gate were stationed 20 akṣauhiṇis with
<div n="lb"/>Stambhini alias Vighnadevi; one hundred akṣauhiṇis to
<div n="lb"/>guard the chariot; all the nine {%parva%} deities shook with fear
<div n="lb"/>seeing the great army following Bhaṇḍa; on its front was
<div n="lb"/>{%geyacakra%} and behind was {%kiricakra;%} there were other śaktis
<div n="lb"/>riding on different animals — lion, camel, deer, elephant, etc.
<div n="lb"/>at the entrance was Jvālāmālinika; the fight began on the
<div n="lb"/>fourth day and ended in complete success; in the neighbour-
<div n="lb"/>hood of Cintāmaṇigraha.
