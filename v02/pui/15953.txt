{%Sukanyā%} (I)¦ — A daughter of Sayāti: when once she
<div n="lb"/>went with her father to the hermitage of Cyavana, she saw
<div n="lb"/>an anthill with two luminous objects in holes which she
<div n="lb"/>pricked with a thorn. This resulted in blood-flowing from
<div n="lb"/>the eyes of the sage Cyavana. The king asked the sage's
<div n="lb"/>pardon by giving his daughter in marriage. Aśvins called
<div n="lb"/>on them and made Cyavana look young to the puzzle of
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā. The Aśvins revealed to her of Cyavana's rejuvena-
<div n="lb"/>tion. Once her father came and seeing her with a young
<div n="lb"/>man, he took him to be her paramour and scolded her. But
<div n="lb"/>when he heard the truth of the matter he was pleased.
