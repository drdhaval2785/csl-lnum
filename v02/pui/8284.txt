{%Pṛthu%} (I)¦ — (Vainya) the son got out of Vena by the
<div n="lb"/>churning of his right arm by the sages to save him from
<div n="lb"/>falling into hell: is considered the ninth incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Hari. The first king who introduced agriculture.<sup>1</sup> Pane-
<div n="lb"/>gyrised by the Gandharvas, and Siddhas playing on different
<div n="lb"/>musical instruments. For his coronation, presents came
<div n="lb"/>from Indra, Brahmā, Yama, Rudra and other gods; praised
<div n="lb"/>by Sūta, Māgadha and Bandin. Though these were dis-
<div n="lb"/>couraged, yet they continued to praise him for his righteous
<div n="lb"/>administrative policy. His sway extended to the Udaya
<div n="lb"/>hills.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Due to scarcity of supply, people complained of
<div n="lb"/>hunger, when Pṛthu aimed his arrow and threatened to
<div n="lb"/>vanquish her. The earth let herself be milked. With Svā-
<div n="lb"/>yambhuva Manu for the calf and his own palms as pail; he
<div n="lb"/>milked the essence of all plants. This was followed by the
<div n="lb"/>sages, gods, asuras and others. Hilly tracts were levelled,
<div n="lb"/>and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were orga-
<div n="lb"/>nised for the first time.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Consecrated himself to perform one hundred aśvame-
<div n="lb"/>dhas on the Sarasvatī. When 99 were over, jealous Indra
<div n="lb"/>ran away with the sacrificial horse. Advised by Atri, the
<div n="lb"/>king's son pursued him as the kite did Rāvaṇa and recover-
<div n="lb"/>ing the animal, earned the title Vijitāśva. Again Indra stole
<div n="lb"/>the horse, and Vijitāśva pursued him and recovered it.
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu saw marks of sin on the part of Indra behaving like
[Page2-382+ 42]
<div n="lb"/>a miscreant and aimed his arrow at him. Persuaded by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, he controlled his rage and became friendly to
<div n="lb"/>Indra. On advice from Viṣṇu, he cast off his enmity to
<div n="lb"/>Indra and embraced him. Asked of the Lord to be ever
<div n="lb"/>devoted to him.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>On his return to the capital, the citizens accorded him
<div n="lb"/>a welcome. Made the middle country between Gangā and
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā his home. Advised his subjects, who praised him, to
<div n="lb"/>conduct themselves righteously. Was visited by Sanatkumāra
<div n="lb"/>with three other sages who taught him {%ātmagñāna.%}<sup>5</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>queen Arcis gave birth to five sons, all rising to his ideal.
<div n="lb"/>He followed the path of the Lokapālas, and his fame as of
<div n="lb"/>Somarāja reached the ears of women as that of Rāma the
<div n="lb"/>ears of the virtuous.<sup>6</sup> Finding himself aged, he entrusted
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom to his sons and left with his queen to the forest.
<div n="lb"/>Launched on a course of severe penance until his last
<div n="lb"/>breath went out of his body. In the funeral pyre which the
<div n="lb"/>queen lighted for her husband's cremation, she threw her-
<div n="lb"/>self and ascended to heaven, praised by the wives of the gods.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Thus Pṛthu, the lord of seven dvīpas, still thirsting to have
<div n="lb"/>more territory, renounced his kingdom and sought refuge
<div n="lb"/>with Hari.<sup>8</sup> A Mantrakṛt of the Cākṣusa Manu line. The
<div n="lb"/>first Kṣatriya to be a Rāja. By him the earth became known
<div n="lb"/>as Pṛthvi.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>His accession was the occasion of a {%pratisarga%} when
<div n="lb"/>rulers were appointed over several classes of beings; got the
<div n="lb"/>grace of Viṣṇu and milked the cow-earth, got grains and
<div n="lb"/>eatables and made the earth flow with milk and honey;
<div n="lb"/>there was no need for the application of the Arthaśāstra
<div n="lb"/>maxims; he levelled the ground from Cape Comorin to the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas and cleared the forests;<sup>10</sup> made it safe and secure;
<div n="lb"/>made the 16 gifts.<sup>11</sup>
