{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}¦ — a son of Kuntī and Pāṇḍu born of
<div n="lb"/>Dharma, and father of Prativindhya and Sudhanu. Devaka
<div n="lb"/>was another son by Pauravī; descendants of Ajamīḍha;<sup>1</sup> was
<div n="lb"/>defeated in a game of dice and was banished to the forest
<div n="lb"/>with his brothers and their wife. Was met and consoled by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā. Kṛṣṇa's respects to: heard from
<div n="lb"/>Nārada that Kṛṣṇa was the Supreme Hari and was much
<div n="lb"/>pleased. Enquired of Him when he met him at the city of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāñcālas. He and his four brothers were met by Kṛta-
<div n="lb"/>varman.<sup>2</sup> His desire to perform the Rājasūya; joy at Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>visit: provided suitable lodgings for Kṛṣṇa and his family.
<div n="lb"/>Addressing of the assembly on his desire to perform the
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya, Kṛṣṇa asked him to get ready by defeating all the
<div n="lb"/>kings and bringing thus all the earth under his control:
<div n="lb"/>sent out his brothers in the four directions who defeated
<div n="lb"/>kings and brought much wealth. Was glad of Jarāsandha's
<div n="lb"/>death at the hands of his brothers: Sent for Purohitas for
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice and invited all his kith and kin. The {%yajña%}
<div n="lb"/>comparable to that of Varuṇa; attended by all gods. For
<div n="lb"/>doing honour to the {%Sadasyas%} there was some doubt about
<div n="lb"/>the first place, and Sahadeva's suggestion of Kṛṣṇa's name
<div n="lb"/>was accepted by all except Śiśupāla who insulted him in
<div n="lb"/>the public assembly. Kṛṣṇa's silence. The Pāṇḍavas with
<div n="lb"/>the Matsyas and others unsheathed their swords, and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>sent his {%cakra%} which cut off his head. After {%avabhṛta,%}
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira shone like Indra. All took leave of him in
<div n="lb"/>joy except Duryodhana, who became jealous of the success
<div n="lb"/>of the Rājasūya and of Draupadī, and of Kṛṣṇa. Heard of
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana's fall in the {%sabhā%} and sent Kṛṣṇa with dress
<div n="lb"/>and ornaments to him, which he rejected.<sup>3</sup> On the occasion
<div n="lb"/>of the Rājasūya, asked Nārada how Caidya, Śiśupāla and
<div n="lb"/>Dantavaktra, haters of Hari became merged with him after
<div n="lb"/>their death, as also about {%Sanātana dharma;%}<sup>4</sup> was met by
<div n="lb"/>Upaplāvya, by Kṛṣṇa and the other Yadus;<sup>5</sup> went to
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra for war. On his side were Virāṭa, Drupada,
<div n="lb"/>Śīkhaṇḍi, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Sātyaki, Kekayas, Saibya and
<div n="lb"/>others. Killed Śālva in the field. Welcomed Balarāma after
[Page3-033+ 35]
<div n="lb"/>the war, and left for Hāstinapura and was anointed king:
<div n="lb"/>rule of righteousness.<sup>5</sup> Felt aggrieved over the slaughter of
<div n="lb"/>his kith and kin: agreed with Draupadī regarding the release
<div n="lb"/>of Aśvatthāma, went with his brothers to see Bhīṣma in his
<div n="lb"/>death-bed, like Kubera with the Yakṣas. Requested Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>to give him the truth of {%mokṣa dharma.%} Did the funeral rites
<div n="lb"/>to him, and after returning to the capital, ruled righteously
<div n="lb"/>with the approval of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Kṛṣṇa: three {%aśva-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%medhas%} were performed by him at the suggestion of Kṛṣṇa:
<div n="lb"/>Missed seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī, and learnt of their
<div n="lb"/>life in the Himālayas. The rule was characterised by plenty
<div n="lb"/>of rains and crops and by absence of diseases and difficul-
<div n="lb"/>ties;<sup>6</sup> learnt the {%Angāravrata%} from the sage, Pippalāda;<sup>7</sup> went
<div n="lb"/>to Syamantapañcaka for the solar eclipse and there met
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and other friends; was taken leave of by the sages:
<div n="lb"/>left it for his capital.<sup>8</sup> Felt the advent of Kali everywhere:
<div n="lb"/>Installed his grandson Parīkṣit on the throne and Vajra at
<div n="lb"/>Mathurā: Prepared to go to {%svarga:%} Clad in bark, fasting,
<div n="lb"/>and silent, he went towards north with a view to attaining
<div n="lb"/>heaven: was followed by his brothers: Attained Hari through
<div n="lb"/>friendship.<sup>9</sup>
