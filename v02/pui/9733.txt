{%Bhūtāni%}¦ — three-fold movements; {%naimittika, prākṛtika,%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%ātyantika; naimittika%} is Brahmā; in the dissolution of
<div n="lb"/>creatures lies the natural destruction of all beings; {%ātyantika%}
<div n="lb"/>is due to knowledge, not as a result of action; from these
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā again begins the work of creation after he wakes
[Page2-575+ 28]
<div n="lb"/>up from his sleep; during his sleep there is no continuous
<div n="lb"/>rain; rivers are with little or no waters; the sun's seven rays
<div n="lb"/>scorch the earth and draw away even the little water; every-
<div n="lb"/>thing is burnt down; no trees or plants; the heat penetrates
<div n="lb"/>the {%Pātāla%} and the {%Vāyu lokas;%} all the worlds are burnt
<div n="lb"/>down; everywhere is to be seen one flame of fire; then set in
<div n="lb"/>clouds in different hues and in different shapes, pour down
<div n="lb"/>rains and appease the fire which enters into waters, result-
<div n="lb"/>ing in the condition of {%ekārṇava%} out of which emerges
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, the first progenitor and {%Puruṣa;%} the seven sages see
<div n="lb"/>him; then, are gradually born all the kings one by one; simi-
<div n="lb"/>larly sages, men, gods and other things.
<div n="P"/>Br. IV. 1. 128 to 207.
