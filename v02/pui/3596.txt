{%Keśidhvaja%}¦ — son of Kṛtadhvaja and skilled in devo-
<div n="lb"/>tion; banished in hostility Khāṇdikya from his kingdom;
<div n="lb"/>once a tiger slew his milch cow; to find out the {%prāyaścitta%}
<div n="lb"/>he went to consult Kaśeru who sent him to Sunaka and he
<div n="lb"/>commended the name of Khāṇḍikya. So he went to the
<div n="lb"/>forest clad in deer-skin like a religious student and demanded
<div n="lb"/>the form of penance. Khāṇḍikya thought at first that he
<div n="lb"/>had come there to kill him, took up his bow, but laid it
<div n="lb"/>aside; instruction was received and the penance was over.
<div n="lb"/>Keśi felt that some fee was due to Khāṇḍikya and once more
<div n="lb"/>called on him; though his councillors advised him to take
<div n="lb"/>back the kingdom, his mind hankering after the other world;
<div n="lb"/>he requested for his fee for his instruction on the doctrine
<div n="lb"/>of soul; after imparting instruction on {%yoga%} to Khāṇḍikya
<div n="lb"/>retired to a life of peace and attained liberation; father of
<div n="lb"/>Bhānumat.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. IX. 13. 20-21. Vi. VI. 6. 5-50; 7. 101-06.
