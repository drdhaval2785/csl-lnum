{%Abhiṣeka%}¦ — The anointing ceremony: when Puru, the
<div n="lb"/>last son was recommended by Yayāti, the people said that
<div n="lb"/>it was {%dharma%} to anoint the eldest; defined the law that the
<div n="lb"/>faithful son alone was fit for the throne; Puru having fulfilled
<div n="lb"/>his father's wishes was to be regarded the faithful and
<div n="lb"/>dutiful; this was agreed to; further it was endorsed by
<div n="lb"/>Śukra.
<div n="P"/>Vā. 93. 76-87; 99. 451.
