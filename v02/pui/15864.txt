{%Sāvitrī%} (VI)¦ — the daughter of Aśvapati and Mālatī, mar-
<div n="lb"/>ried Satyavān. Nārada spoke to her of his short life: Followed
<div n="lb"/>him to the forest knowing that his end was nearing. Enjoyed
<div n="lb"/>his company seeing the fauna and flora there: saw him un-
<div n="lb"/>conscious when cutting fuel,<sup>1</sup> saw the Lord of death and
<div n="lb"/>begged him on her knees to let him live. Yama granted her
<div n="lb"/>a boon which she would desire. Her first was that her
<div n="lb"/>father-in-law should get back his sight and his kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Though granted, she pursued Yama to free her husband and
<div n="lb"/>praised the god's glory. She was asked to name another boon
<div n="lb"/>and that was to bless her father with a number of sons. It
<div n="lb"/>was granted. Yama asked her to get back. She did not feel
<div n="lb"/>weary and pursued him. Her third request was to grant
<div n="lb"/>her one hundred sons. Her continuous praise and earnest-
<div n="lb"/>ness pleased the god who restored her husband back to life.
<div n="lb"/>She returned to the place where the body of Satyavān lay,
<div n="lb"/>with him she went home, found Dyumatsena enjoying his
<div n="lb"/>regained eye-sight and people requesting him to take up the
<div n="lb"/>kingship again. Lived long and happy.<sup>2</sup>
