{%Māyāvatī%}¦ — Rati in her former birth: when her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band was burnt by {%Śiva,%} she was reborn as the superinten-
<div n="lb"/>dent of Śambara's kitchen. Hearing from Nārada that
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna was Kāma and that he was thrown into sea by
<div n="lb"/>Śambara and swallowed by a fish and was brought to her
<div n="lb"/>kitchen, she nursed him lovingly and when he came of age,
<div n="lb"/>she spoke the truth and taught him {%mahāmāyā vidyā%} with
<div n="lb"/>which he killed Śambara: She took him by air to Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and was rejoiced to become the daughter-in-law of Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Rukmiṇī.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 55. 6-38; Vi. V. 27. 7-16, 27-30.
