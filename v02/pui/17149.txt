{%Haṃsonārāyaṇa%}¦ — Brahmā; comes out of the Ekārṇava;
<div n="lb"/>the same as what the Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads say of
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣoyajña; being a Vedamaya he introduces 16 Ṛtviks
<div n="lb"/>required for a Yajña from the different limbs of a body;
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya came out of his face and saw the world plunged
<div n="lb"/>in waters and wondered at it. Once again he entered the
<div n="lb"/>body of the Lord, and coming out again he saw a child sleep-
<div n="lb"/>ing on a branch of the banyan tree. He got afraid of his
<div n="lb"/>loneliness when the baby Lord asked him not to be afraid of
<div n="lb"/>him and told him that he was his father and Hṛṣikeśa, etc; con-
[Page3-741+ 30]
<div n="lb"/>versation between them; then he entered the bowels of the
<div n="lb"/>Lord;<sup>1</sup> after the stipulated period the Lord thought of the
<div n="lb"/>universe and then came Vaiśvānara; then a thousand-leafed
<div n="lb"/>lotus issued from his navel in the shape of the earth. There
<div n="lb"/>appeared Brahmā, the different hills, countries, Mlecchas,
<div n="lb"/>etc; from this originated Padmavīdhi in Yajñas;<sup>2</sup> there also
<div n="lb"/>came Madhu and Kaiṭabha, two representatives of the
<div n="lb"/>qualities of rajas and tamas who invited the creator for
<div n="lb"/>war. Then they sought and got death from Viṣṇu. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>created a number of mind-born sons as Progenitors of the
<div n="lb"/>world.<sup>3</sup>
