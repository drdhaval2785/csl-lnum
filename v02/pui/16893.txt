<div n="lb"/>sacrifice to Kāli, who knowing Bharata's spiritual eminence

<div n="lb"/>to the hermitage of Kapila he did not bear it well, and when
<div n="lb"/>asked once and twice the Brahman burst out into high philo-
<div n="lb"/>sophy which the king learnt from him and renounced all
<div n="lb"/>kinds of distinction.
