{%Chāyā%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Viśvakarman,<sup>1</sup> a servant-
<div n="lb"/>maid of Samjñā engaged by the latter for her husband. Hence
[Page1-619+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>wife of the sun God without his knowledge and mother of
<div n="lb"/>Śanaiścara and Tapatī during the absence of Samjñā as a
<div n="lb"/>horse. Her sons were Śrutaśrava and Śrutakarma or
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi Manu and Saturn respectively; illtreated Samjñā's
<div n="lb"/>children. Yama protested and was cursed to lose his legs.
<div n="lb"/>He reported to his father who said that they would be
<div n="lb"/>restored after some time. Then he asked Chāyā why she
<div n="lb"/>showed difference between her sons and she spoke the
<div n="lb"/>truth. The sun God flew into a rage and demanded
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣtā to give up his daughter. He showed the place where
<div n="lb"/>Sarvajñā was and Tvaṣtā reduced his {%tejas.%} On seeing her,
<div n="lb"/>Śukra came through his nostrils from which were born the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvins or Nāsatya and Dasra.<sup>2</sup>
