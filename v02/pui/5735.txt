{%Dakṣa%} (I)¦ — a Mind-born son of Brahmā, born of his
<div n="lb"/>thumb, and father of Mūrti. A progenitor and guardian of
<div n="lb"/>the world, born for the creation of worldly beings.<sup>1</sup> Married
<div n="lb"/>Prasūtī, daughter of Svāyambhuva Manu. Had sixteen
<div n="lb"/>daughters of whom he gave thirteen to Dharma, one to Agni,
<div n="lb"/>one to Pitṛs, and one to Śiva.<sup>2</sup> To the Satra of Viśvasṛk
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa came and was welcomed by all standing, except
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and Śiva. On this Dakṣa burst into anger against
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and insulted him saying he had eyes like a monkey, was a
<div n="lb"/>breaker of law and convention, lord of the Bhūtas and Gaṇas;
<div n="lb"/>he then cursed that Śiva should have no more share in sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fices and went away. Nandi got enraged at this and im-
<div n="lb"/>precated a curse on Dakṣa that he would lose all knowledge
<div n="lb"/>of Ātman, and assuming the face of a sheep, would become
<div n="lb"/>dull-witted. Bhṛgu then pronounced a counter-curse that
<div n="lb"/>those propitiating Śiva shall become Pākhaṇḍas.<sup>3</sup> Appointed
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmā as the overlord of all Prajāpatis, Dakṣa began
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice of Bṛhaspatisava to which all gods went in
<div n="lb"/>groups. Satī also expressed her desire to go and requested
<div n="lb"/>permission of Śiva, who reminded her of the insult offered to
<div n="lb"/>him.<sup>4</sup> As she was persistent, she was allowed to attend.
<div n="lb"/>Going, she found that she was not properly welcomed by her
<div n="lb"/>father. The enraged Satī sat facing the northern direction
<div n="lb"/>in yoga and cast off her body by means of the fire of Samādhī
<div n="lb"/>to the distress of gods and others. On this the Gaṇa followers
<div n="lb"/>of Satī attacked Dakṣa, when Bhṛgu created a class of gods,
<div n="lb"/>Ṛbhus who vanquished these Gaṇas.<sup>5</sup> Having heard of all
<div n="lb"/>this from Nārada, Śiva grew angry; out of his anger sprang
<div n="lb"/>Vīrabhadra who was ordered to ruin Dakṣa's sacrifice. The
<div n="lb"/>beard of Bhṛgu was cut off, and Dakṣa's head was severed
<div n="lb"/>from his body and thrown into the Dakṣiṇāgni.<sup>6</sup> The Gods
<div n="lb"/>waited upon Brahmā who proceeded to Kailāsa. He conciliat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Śiva and pleaded for the revival of Dakṣa and continuation
<div n="lb"/>of his {%Yajña%} promising a share to him.<sup>7</sup> Śiva agreed but
[Page2-059+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>said that Dakṣa should have the face of the sheep, Bhaga,
<div n="lb"/>Mitra's eye, and Bhṛgu the beard of a sheep. Agreeing to this
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā went with Śiva to the sacrificial hall of Dakṣa. Now
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa began to praise Śiva. When Viṣṇu's offering was
<div n="lb"/>poured to secure the continuation of the sacrifice, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>presented himself in person when Dakṣa, Ṛtviks, Sadasyas,
<div n="lb"/>Rudra and others present, spoke in his praise. Pleased at
<div n="lb"/>this, Hari remarked there was no difference among the
<div n="lb"/>Trimurtīs. Dakṣa brought the {%yajña%} to a successful end.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Another account.%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Dakṣa%} son of Varkṣī (Māriṣā-{%Vi. P.%}) and Pracetas (Prā-
<div n="lb"/>cetasaṣ-{%Vi. P.%}); a Prajāpati. He first created the Devas,
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, men and others inhabiting the sky, earth
<div n="lb"/>and water. Finding the creation incomplete, he went
<div n="lb"/>to the Vindhyas for {%tapas%} by bathing in the Agha-
<div n="lb"/>marṣaṇa and propitiating Hari with the hymn of
<div n="lb"/>{%hamsaguhya.%} To him the Lord appeared and urged
<div n="lb"/>him to marry Asiknī, daughter of Pañcajana and
<div n="lb"/>thus increase the created beings.<sup>9</sup> Of Asiknī he begot 10,000
<div n="lb"/>sons called Haryaśvas. The latter proceeded to the western
<div n="lb"/>direction to the sacred lake Nārāyaṇasaras at the estuary
<div n="lb"/>of the Indus. Purified by the bath and instructed by Nārada
<div n="lb"/>on the bondage of Samsāra, these took to the path of ‘not
<div n="lb"/>returning’ {%(anvartana).%} Dakṣa lamented and begot by the
<div n="lb"/>same wife a thousand sons, Śabalāśvas. These again followed
<div n="lb"/>the path trodden by their elder brothers, advised by Nārada.
<div n="lb"/>The enraged Dakṣa cursed that Nārada, the corrupter
<div n="lb"/>of youth, was ever to be a wanderer and to have no settled
<div n="lb"/>home. The sage submitted to it without retaliating.<sup>10</sup> Con-
<div n="lb"/>soled by Brahmā, Dakṣa further begot sixty daughters of
<div n="lb"/>Asiknī (Vairinī-{%M. P.%}). He bestowed ten on Dharma,
<div n="lb"/>twelve on Kaśyapa, twenty-seven on Soma, two each for
<div n="lb"/>Bhūta, Angiras, and Kṛśāśva, and the remaining five, of
<div n="lb"/>whom only four seem to be named (in v. 21) on Tārkṣyā.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Elsewhere it is said that thirteen daughters were given in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to Kaśyapa.

<div n="lb"/>present at the anointing of Vāmana; father of Aditi;<sup>13</sup> cursed
<div n="lb"/>Moon god with consumption {%(yakṣma).%}<sup>14</sup> Wondered at
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya's vrata;<sup>15</sup> had not yet seen the Supreme Being;
<div n="lb"/>identified with Hari.<sup>16</sup>
