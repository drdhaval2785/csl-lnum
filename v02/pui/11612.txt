{%Rāma%}¦ (III) ({%Paraśurāma%}) — a son of Jamadagni and
<div n="lb"/>Reṇukā; an {%amśa%} of Hari. Heard from his father that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna-Haihaya had taken Kāmadhenu against his wish,
<div n="lb"/>and getting angry went to Haihaya's capital, cut off the
<div n="lb"/>king's head and took back the cow. In order to get rid of
<div n="lb"/>the sin of killing a king, he went on {%tīrthayātra%} for a year.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In obedience to his father's command he killed his mother
<div n="lb"/>and brothers. This pleased the father and by his boon to
<div n="lb"/>his son, they all came back to life. During his absence, the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Haihaya killed his father, and on his return, found
<div n="lb"/>his mother crying over the death of Jamadagni. He took
<div n="lb"/>his axe, ran to Māhiṣmatī, rooted out all the Kṣatriyas by
<div n="lb"/>defeating them twenty-one times; with their blood he made
<div n="lb"/>nine pools at Syamantapañcaka, where he worshipped his
<div n="lb"/>father's dead body and distributed the various regions to
<div n="lb"/>the priests; ended it with {%avabhṛta%} in the {%Sarasvatī.%}<sup>2</sup> He
<div n="lb"/>would be a great sage in the forthcoming {%manvantara.%} A
<div n="lb"/>sage of the 8th {%manvantara.%} Even today resides in Mahen-
<div n="lb"/>dra contemplating on Hari;<sup>3</sup> was invited for the Rājasūya of
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira and came to see Kṛṣṇa at Syamantapañcaka.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In his early years, with the leave of his parents, he visited
<div n="lb"/>his grand parents Ṛcīka and Satyavatī; and after some stay
<div n="lb"/>there, called on his great grandfather Bhṛgu, who advised
[Page3-076+ 34]
<div n="lb"/>him to do {%tapas%} in the Himālayas in honour of Śiva. Engaged
<div n="lb"/>in {%tapas%} by standing in water in the winter and on the fire
<div n="lb"/>in summer, by means of Padmāsana; Śiva in hunter's guise
<div n="lb"/>visited him and asked him to quit his place. Suspecting
<div n="lb"/>him to be god, Rāma, appealed to him when Śiva showed
<div n="lb"/>his true form. Instructed by Śiva, he went round the
<div n="lb"/>earth on a pilgrimage tour. Helped the Devas in routing the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras; continued his {%tapas%} by worshipping Śiva as mṛga-
<div n="lb"/>vyādha. Pleased, the Lord instructed him in the {%astra-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%grāma%} in its four aspects; went to Brahmā for advice before
<div n="lb"/>he started on his crusade against the Kṣatriyas. Advised
<div n="lb"/>to meet Śiva and to get initiated into {%Kṛṣṇamantra kavacam;%}
<div n="lb"/>Śiva instructed him with {%Trailokya vijayam mantram.%} On
<div n="lb"/>his way back he stayed at Puṣkara and heard a male deer
<div n="lb"/>narrating the story of Paraśurāma and Akṛtavraṇa to the
<div n="lb"/>female deer, adding that his was not the {%uttama bhakti%} but
<div n="lb"/>the {%madhyama.%} He took the hint from that conversation
<div n="lb"/>that he would achieve his end by Agastya's grace. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>repaired to the hermitage of Agastya, followed by the deer.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Mūlaka afraid of;<sup>6</sup> a Brāhmaṇa;<sup>7</sup> a slayer of the Kṣatriyas;
<div n="lb"/>versed in Dhanurveda;<sup>8</sup> equal in prowess to Indra resplend-
<div n="lb"/>ent and a mixture of Brahma and Kṣatra;<sup>9</sup> consort Dharanī.<sup>10</sup>
