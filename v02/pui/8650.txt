{%Prayāgā%} (II)¦ — (Māhātmyam): Markaṇḍeya to
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira on; here is Prajāpatikṣetra; people who
<div n="lb"/>bathe here go to heaven and who die here are liberated
<div n="lb"/>from {%samsāra;%} guarded by Indra; there are five deep
<div n="lb"/>channels in Prayāgā with the Ganges flowing in their midst.
<div n="lb"/>Sins are washed off by entering its boundary. The
<div n="lb"/>goddess Yamunā, the daughter of the Sun God is ever
<div n="lb"/>present: It is a place haunted by the Gods, Asuras, Ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>and Siddhas;<sup>1</sup> one who remembers Prayāgā from his own
<div n="lb"/>native home or from a foreign place on the eve of his death
<div n="lb"/>goes to the world of Brahmā. Leaving the heaven, he is
<div n="lb"/>reborn as a King of Jambūdvīpa; gifts of cows, jewels and
<div n="lb"/>gold here attain great merit: The giver is born in Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Kuru regions and enjoys long life.<sup>2</sup> One should not drive
<div n="lb"/>to the place in a conveyance drawn by bullocks lest the
<div n="lb"/>virtue of bathing should be lost. Giving daughters in mar-
<div n="lb"/>riage, and death near the Akṣayavaṭa helps one in going to
<div n="lb"/>the world of Śiva. One should go and do charities with
<div n="lb"/>utmost faith. Here are 60 crores and 10000 holy spots; well-
<div n="lb"/>known for a Śiva shrine: Pratiṣṭhāna lies to the east of
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges, and to its north lies the Hamsaprapatana {%Tīrtha.%}
<div n="lb"/>There are again Ūrvaśīramaṇa, Sandhya Vaṭa, Koṭī {%Tīrtha,%}
<div n="lb"/>and others, all holy;<sup>3</sup> by merely listening to the greatness of
<div n="lb"/>Prayāgā a man gets liberated. To the south of Prayāgā
<div n="lb"/>there is a Ṛṇamocana {%Tīrtha%} where by residing for a night
<div n="lb"/>and by bathing, one never runs into debts. A pilgrimage to
<div n="lb"/>P. gives the benefit of an Aśvamedha sacrifice: relieves his
<div n="lb"/>{%manes%} for ten generations: its circumference is five yojanas
[Page2-428+ 35]
<div n="lb"/>and every step is sacred: the greatness of the Yamunā
<div n="lb"/>described;<sup>4</sup> a man dying at P. gets the benefits of a
<div n="lb"/>Yogin: the king of all {%tīrthas:%} P. is again the place where
<div n="lb"/>both Kambala and Aśvatara reside. It is the altar of Prajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati. It is more sacred, being situated on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges. It is the giver of heaven, the personification of
<div n="lb"/>bliss and truth: Reading the Mahātmya takes one to
<div n="lb"/>heaven;<sup>5</sup> Here Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva are all present.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā stands on the Northern part of the {%Tīrtha%} to protect
<div n="lb"/>it: Viṣṇu is represented as Veṇī Mādhava, while Śiva is
<div n="lb"/>present in the shape of a banyan tree. In addition to them,
<div n="lb"/>the gods, oceans and mountains also live there. It is known
<div n="lb"/>as Prajāpati Indrakṣetra. One who remembers this every
<div n="lb"/>day attains heaven. After hearing this, Yudhiṣṭhira is said
<div n="lb"/>to have bathed in Prayāgā.<sup>6</sup>
