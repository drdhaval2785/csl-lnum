{%Amṛtotpādanam%}¦ (see {%Amṛtam%}) — suggested by Hari-
<div n="lb"/>Ajita to secure immortality for gods. It was to churn the
<div n="lb"/>{%kṣīroda%} with Mandara as stick and Vāsuki as rope. The
<div n="lb"/>Asuras agreed to aid the gods in securing {%Amṛta.%} Hari took
<div n="lb"/>hold at first of the head, and when the Asuras protested, of
<div n="lb"/>the tail of Vāsuki. Seeing exhaustion on the part of gods
<div n="lb"/>owing to obstacle of Vighneśa, Hari propped up the Mandara
<div n="lb"/>hill, assuming the form of a tortoise. With continuous effort,
<div n="lb"/>the churning went on. First appeared {%Hālāhala%} which was
<div n="lb"/>consumed by Śiva on an appeal from the Prajāpatis and with
<div n="lb"/>the permission of Pārvatī. Then came out {%Kāmadhenu%} which
<div n="lb"/>sages appropriated for agnihotra; {%Uccaiśśravas,%} a horse which
<div n="lb"/>Bali took; then {%Airāvata: Kaustubha%} gem appropriated by
<div n="lb"/>Hari, then {%Pārijāta, Apsaras%} women and then {%Srī%} married to
<div n="lb"/>Hari. Then came out {%Vāruṇīdevī%} whom Asuras seized, then
<div n="lb"/>Dhanvantari with a pot of {%Amṛta.%} There was then a rush on
<div n="lb"/>both sides to get the {%Amṛta%} first when Hari assumed the
<div n="lb"/>form of {%Mohinī%} and arrested their attention. Moved by her
<div n="lb"/>beauty, both gods and Asuras agreed to let her distribute the
<div n="lb"/>{%Amṛta%} to all of them. She began with the gods and was
<div n="lb"/>serving them first. Noticing this {%Rāhu%} took the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>god. On being pointed out by the sun and moon, Hari cut
<div n="lb"/>off his head with his {%Cakra.%} The Asuras found that they
<div n="lb"/>had been deluded by Hari and set their face against Him.
