{%Prabhāsaurī%}¦ — at sunset the rays of the sun enter fire
<div n="lb"/>and hence the latter is seen in the night; when the sun rises
<div n="lb"/>in the morning, fire enters the sun's rays and hence the light
<div n="lb"/>of fire is not seen in the day; when the sun is in the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the earth night enters the waters and hence they are of
<div n="lb"/>the copper colour. In the night day enters the waters and
<div n="lb"/>hence waters take the white colour. Thus {%ahorātras%}
<div n="lb"/>enter waters.
