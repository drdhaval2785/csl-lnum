{%Vena%}¦ — a son of Anga, of cruel and wrong beha-
<div n="lb"/>viour; fell dead due to the curse of sages who churned his
<div n="lb"/>right arm out of which came Pṛthu; born after {%aśvamedha%}
[Page3-323+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>of his father. The twenty-third Vedavyāsa.<sup>1</sup> Brought up in
<div n="lb"/>the house of his grandfather who was an amśa of Mṛtyu
<div n="lb"/>(adharma) Vena acquired bad conduct, killed his playmates
<div n="lb"/>like animals and became a source of vexation to his father
<div n="lb"/>who left the kingdom in disgust and distress. Vena was
<div n="lb"/>crowned. Blinded by pride he proclaimed that there should
<div n="lb"/>be no more yajñas or gifts in his kingdom. Lost it through
<div n="lb"/>pride of power. He did not listen to the words of sages and
<div n="lb"/>asserted he was the highest of all gods. Seeing him perverse
<div n="lb"/>and vile, the sages slew him; Sunīthā protected his body by
<div n="lb"/>{%mantra.%} To avoid anarchy and to preserve the line of Anga,
<div n="lb"/>the sages churned the thigh of the dead prince and there
<div n="lb"/>came a black dwarfish man, the ancestor of the Niṣādha race.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>They continued to churn the two arms out of which came a
<div n="lb"/>male and female child, being the {%amśa%} of Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Thrown into hell by Brāhmaṇas, was saved from hell by
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu.<sup>4</sup> Pṛthu was the father's part of Vena's body; from
<div n="lb"/>the mother's part of his body came the Mlecchas.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>Another version: A son of the daughter of Kāla; took to
<div n="lb"/>kāma and covetousness; founded an adharma sthāpana, gave
<div n="lb"/>up Veda śāstras; subjects of, did not learn Vedas or performed
<div n="lb"/>ceremonials or yajñas; made himself the object of sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>and worship; enraged by the ṛṣis led by Marīci who advised
<div n="lb"/>him to take up the right path; ridiculed them and said he was
<div n="lb"/>a mahātmā and could burn the whole world or flood it; hence
<div n="lb"/>the sages held him down and had his left hand churned by
<div n="lb"/>force; there came out a short black figure who stood trem-
<div n="lb"/>bling; the sages said niṣīda, the forerunner of the niṣāda-
<div n="lb"/>vamśa; then they churned his right hand and Pṛthu was born;
<div n="lb"/>Vena died; Pṛthu crowned by all; a good king; his rule and
<div n="lb"/>achievements, including the milking of the earth by all
<div n="lb"/>beings.<sup>6</sup>
