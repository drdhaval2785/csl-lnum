{%Nṛga%} (II)¦ — a son of Ikṣvāku; liberal in his gift of cows,
<div n="lb"/>silver, etc. Once a cow of a certain Brahmana got mixed
<div n="lb"/>up with his herd, and ignorant of this he made a gift of it
<div n="lb"/>to another Brahmana. The owner charged him, and when
<div n="lb"/>both went to the king, the owner was not prepared to take
<div n="lb"/>anything in its place and he who got the gift would not
<div n="lb"/>part with it for anything; when he went to Yama's abode
<div n="lb"/>he sent him as a lizard for this unrighteous act; in that form
<div n="lb"/>he lived in a well until Kṛṣṇa lifted it up when it became
<div n="lb"/>transformed into a celestial, and blessed by Kṛṣṇa rode in
<div n="lb"/>an aerial car to heaven;<sup>1</sup> release of, by Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā;<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>his lust after more territory.<sup>3</sup>
