{%Kaṃsa%} (I)¦ — the eldest son of Ugrasena<sup>1</sup> and brother
<div n="lb"/>(cousin-{%Vā. P.%}) of Devakī. Took part in the festivities con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with the marriage of Devakī and Vasudeva, when he
<div n="lb"/>heard a voice from air that her eighth son would kill him.
<div n="lb"/>He at once drew his sword to slay Devakī when Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>entreated him to spare her life promising to give him all
<div n="lb"/>her sons. To this he agreed. He did not take notice even
<div n="lb"/>of the first boy. Subsequently Nārada confirmed what he
<div n="lb"/>heard from the welkin. So he killed all her sons and put her
<div n="lb"/>and Vasudeva in jail. He waited for the seventh and was
<div n="lb"/>particularly afraid of the eighth. Being informed of the
<div n="lb"/>birth of a girl, and without listening to his sister's appeal
<div n="lb"/>to spare the baby, he dashed it against a stone. It flew
<div n="lb"/>heavenwards and said that the baby born to vanquish him
[Page1-293+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>was safe. Disheartened, Kaṃsa let Vasudeva and Devakī
<div n="lb"/>free. Consulted his ministers who advised him to kill all
<div n="lb"/>infants in the kingdom, and to hurt all Brāhmaṇas and cows,
<div n="lb"/>the root cause of Hari's {%dharma.%} Messengers were sent out
<div n="lb"/>on this mission.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>An incarnation of Kālanemi. Threw his father Ugra-
<div n="lb"/>sena in prison and assumed regal administration.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Encouraged by his Asura friends such as Pralamba and
<div n="lb"/>Baka, as also by the Māgadhan king, he tyrannized the
<div n="lb"/>Yadus who left the land for other countries like Kuru, Pāñ-
<div n="lb"/>cāla and others. The Brāhmaṇas were afraid of him.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard from Nārada that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva's sons; when he went to slay Vasudeva, Nārada
<div n="lb"/>prevented him from it. He then threw Vasudeva and his
<div n="lb"/>wife in prison. He summoned his councillors and asked the
<div n="lb"/>Mallas, Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika to get ready for a wrestling
<div n="lb"/>match with Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; ordered his mahout to station
<div n="lb"/>the State Elephant at the gate of the enclosure {%(Raṅga)%} and
<div n="lb"/>get Kṛṣṇa and Rāma trampled under its feet; when he was
<div n="lb"/>asked why he was out to kill those two boys, he narrated
<div n="lb"/>the story of his mother once going in the garden thinking
<div n="lb"/>of her husband Ugrasena. Then a Gandharva Drumila per-
<div n="lb"/>sonated Ugrasena. Discovering that he was not her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band, she asked him in wrath who he was. He tried to
<div n="lb"/>console her saying that she would give birth to a heroic son.
<div n="lb"/>The chaste lady retorted that he would be cruel and un-
<div n="lb"/>righteous. Such being his birth, he hated his kith and kin.
<div n="lb"/>Then he commanded to commence the {%Dhanuryāga.%} Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>was sent for and ordered to take his chariot and bring
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to the {%Dhanuryāga%} with all gopas. He
<div n="lb"/>proposed to kill all of them and rule the kingdoms with the
<div n="lb"/>help of friends like Jarāsandha. Thanked by Akrūra for
<div n="lb"/>an opportunity to visit Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; Akrūra reached
<div n="lb"/>the Vraja and was welcomed by the brothers and Nanda.
<div n="lb"/>Informed of their arrival by Akrūra. Much concerned to
<div n="lb"/>know of the breaking of his bow by Kṛṣṇa and further the
<div n="lb"/>killing of his guards. He had no sleep all night and had
<div n="lb"/>bad dreams, all in fear of Kṛṣṇa. Next morning he drove
[Page1-294+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>to the wrestling ground and occupied the royal seat with
<div n="lb"/>his ministers; was perturbed to learn of the death of Kuva-
<div n="lb"/>layāpīḍa and its guards. Became furious at the death of
<div n="lb"/>his five mallas and the running away of others. Ordered
<div n="lb"/>the banishment of the two brothers, robbing the gopas of
<div n="lb"/>their belongings, and imprisonment of Nanda, killing of
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena and Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa attacked him direct, pull-
<div n="lb"/>ed him down from his throne and killed him. His eight
<div n="lb"/>brothers who offered fight were slain by Rāma.<sup>5</sup> Death
<div n="lb"/>welcomed by Gopis and Akrūra.<sup>6</sup> Prevented Vasudeva go-
<div n="lb"/>ing to Karavīrapura. His oppression.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>His queens were Asti and Prāpti, daughters of Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha.<sup>8</sup> His death recalled by Kṛṣṇa to Mucukunda; by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarman to Yudhiṣṭhira; by Kuntī.<sup>9</sup> Attained Hari
<div n="lb"/>through fear.<sup>10</sup> Of the Bhoja family. Funeral rites done
<div n="lb"/>by Ugrasena.<sup>11</sup>
