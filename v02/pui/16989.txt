{%Syamantaka%}¦ — a jewel presented by the Sun god to Satrā-
<div n="lb"/>jita (s.v.) to enable him to see his form distinctly without be-
<div n="lb"/>ing blinded by his hallow; had the quality of yielding eight
<div n="lb"/>loads of gold every day. Kṛṣṇa thought that Ugrasena was
<div n="lb"/>worthy of having it; knowing this Satrājit gave it to his
<div n="lb"/>brother Prasena. He placed it in a room and hedged it with
<div n="lb"/>divinity. Kṛṣṇa asked for it and was refused. It was taken to
<div n="lb"/>the forest by Prasena whom a lion killed. Jāmbavā killed the
<div n="lb"/>lion and got the jewel. Kṛṣṇa fought with him and recover-
<div n="lb"/>ing the jewel, returned it to Satrājita in a public assembly.
<div n="lb"/>Satrājita offered his daughter in marriage to Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>made a gift of the jewel. Kṛṣṇa returned it to Satrājita.
<div n="lb"/>Śatadhanvan killed Satrājita and took it, and placed it with
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra for safe custody. This led to some misunderstand-
<div n="lb"/>ing between Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, and at Kṛṣṇa's request,
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra made it public that it was in his possession.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 37. 18; cch. 56 and 57 (whole); Br. III. 71. 26, 52,
<div n="lb"/>82, 98. M. 45. 4-17; Vā. 96. 25-58. Vi. IV. 3. 14-62, 151-161.
