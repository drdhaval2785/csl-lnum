{%Yayāti%}¦ — the middle son of Nahuṣa and Virajā, the mind-
<div n="lb"/>born daughter of Ajyapas: married Śarmiṣṭhā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣaparvan,<sup>1</sup> and had three sons by her; pleased with him
<div n="lb"/>Indra gave him a golden chariot yoked with swift horses
<div n="lb"/>and which became the ratha of the Paurava kings.<sup>2</sup> Became
<div n="lb"/>king after his father: desire for more territory; placed his
[Page3-018+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>younger brothers in charge of the four quarters of the king-
<div n="lb"/>dom; nature of his good rule described; in the course of a
<div n="lb"/>hunting expedition, he heard the cry of a girl coming out
<div n="lb"/>of a well and going near it found a girl inside standing help-
<div n="lb"/>less and naked; he gave her his upper cloth to wear and
<div n="lb"/>lifted her up. She was Devayānī, the daughter of Śukra
<div n="lb"/>and she became his wife and bore him two sons, Yadu and
<div n="lb"/>Turvasu. Śukra in offering his daughter to the king asked
<div n="lb"/>him not to share his bed with Śarmiṣṭhā. In a weak
<div n="lb"/>moment, forgetting his promise, he yielded to the entreaties
<div n="lb"/>of Śarmiṣṭhā and on this Devayānī departed to Śukra's
<div n="lb"/>place. Yayāti followed her and was cursed by Śukra to
<div n="lb"/>become old; but Śukra said that he could take the youth
<div n="lb"/>of somebody by exchanging it for his old age. He enquired
<div n="lb"/>of all his sons and all except Pūru refused to comply with
<div n="lb"/>his request. With Pūru's youth he enjoyed for long the
<div n="lb"/>company of Devayānī; narrated to her an old story of an
<div n="lb"/>ewe found in a well, loving a ram, who was not faithful at
<div n="lb"/>first but who spent ultimately a long time of enjoyment with
<div n="lb"/>her. He compared himself to that ram and said that he
<div n="lb"/>should thereafter bestow his thought on Hari. So he
<div n="lb"/>returned his youth to Pūru and led a life of penance at
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgutunga after anointing Pūru on the throne and appoint-
<div n="lb"/>ing his other sons in different parts of the kingdom; dis-
<div n="lb"/>courses of, to Pūru on gentleness and friendliness to all;
<div n="lb"/>was devoted to Hari. Parīkṣit compared to Yayāti for his
<div n="lb"/>{%dharma.%}<sup>3</sup> Cursed that Yadu and his line be debarred from
<div n="lb"/>succeeding to the throne, though five dynasties of his sons
<div n="lb"/>are distinguished like the sun's rays.<sup>4</sup> Tenth in genera-
<div n="lb"/>tion from Prajāpati.<sup>5</sup> Went to heaven but Indra sent him
<div n="lb"/>back; one version is that he stands in the {%antarikṣa%} and the
<div n="lb"/>other is that he went back to heaven; met Indra and narrated
<div n="lb"/>Pūru's coronation: Indra told him of the completion of his
<div n="lb"/>righteousness and hence birth on the earth.<sup>6</sup> Falling down,
<div n="lb"/>met Aṣṭaka and the other grandsons, who cleared him of
<div n="lb"/>his doubts regarding the course of fate and man's helpless-
<div n="lb"/>ress, the fruits of karma, the worlds enjoyed by him, the
[Page3-019+ 26]
<div n="lb"/>bhauma naraka, the means to get samjñā, and the duties of
<div n="lb"/>four āśramas and munis.<sup>7</sup> These with Pratardana, Vasuman
<div n="lb"/>and Śibi offered a part of their puṇyam to make Yayāti enjoy
<div n="lb"/>heaven. Śibi leading Yayāti to heaven in a golden chariot
<div n="lb"/>as a result of their good deeds and truthfulness.<sup>8</sup>
