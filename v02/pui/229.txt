{%Ajāmila%}¦ — an old {%itihāsa%} of. A Brāhmaṇa of Kanyā-
<div n="lb"/>kubja, versed in {%śāstras%} and celebrated in {%ācāra.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>when out to get {%kuśa%} grass, he saw a {%dāsī%} and fell in love.
<div n="lb"/>Then he abandoned all his duties and discarded his wedded
<div n="lb"/>wife. The {%dāsī%} became his wife. She bore him ten sons.
<div n="lb"/>The last was named Nārāyaṇa best loved of his parents. At
[Page1-032+ 32]
<div n="lb"/>the time of his death, when the messengers of Yama were
<div n="lb"/>waiting to remove him to hell, he called out his last son by
<div n="lb"/>his name Nārāyaṇa. On this, the messengers of Vīṣṇu were
<div n="lb"/>on the scene and prevented Yama's men from taking the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhman to hell. It was argued that pronouncing the name
<div n="lb"/>of Hari at his death redeemed him of all his sins, and that
<div n="lb"/>alone was the secret of Dharma. Yama heard this and
<div n="lb"/>approved it. Ajāmila, thus rescued from Death, felt peni-
<div n="lb"/>tent, and while making {%tapas%} at Gaṅgādvāra, he cast off his
<div n="lb"/>body and reached {%Viṣṇuloka.%}
