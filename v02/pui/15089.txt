{%Sagara%}¦ — a son of Bāhu, (Phalgutantra) born with {%gara%}
<div n="lb"/>(poison) administered to his mother by the co-wives of her
<div n="lb"/>husband and after 7 years' stay in his mother's womb;
<div n="lb"/>brought up by sage Aurva; Keśinī was one of his queens and
<div n="lb"/>Sumatī was another. Prabhā, and Bhānumatī, mother of
<div n="lb"/>Asamanjasa were also his queens. Father of Asamanjasa
<div n="lb"/>who was abandoned by his father for misconduct.
<div n="P"/>A Cakravarti. His sons 60,000 in number by Sumati,
<div n="lb"/>excavated the sea and dug all over the earth in their search
<div n="lb"/>for the consecrated horse. Helped by Aurva, he propi-
<div n="lb"/>tiated Hari with sacrifices. Once Indra stole his sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>horse, and this was discovered near Kapila's hermitage in the
<div n="lb"/>N. E. by his sons who imputed the theft to the sage. The
<div n="lb"/>latter burnt them to ashes. But Amśumat, son of Asaman-
<div n="lb"/>jasa got back the horse, and enabled his grandfather to com-
<div n="lb"/>plete the sacrifice. Anointed Amśumat on the throne in the
[Page3-502+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>presence of Paurajānapada and devoted himself to attaining
<div n="lb"/>salvation through the path prescribed by Aurva. Greed for
<div n="lb"/>more territory; conquered Tālajanghas, Yavanas, Śakas,
<div n="lb"/>Haihayas and Barbaras. On the advice of his guru, Vasiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>he spared their lives but punished them by disfiguring them — 
<div n="lb"/>some wholly shaven, and some half-shaven. They became
<div n="lb"/>ancestors of Mlecchas and Vrātyas.<sup>1</sup> Realised the yoga power
<div n="lb"/>of Hari.<sup>2</sup> Addressed by him Vasiṣṭha narrated the story of
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. In the case of Haihayas, he conquered the
<div n="lb"/>king and burnt the city. When he invaded the Vidarbhas,
<div n="lb"/>its king sought alliance by offering his daughter in marriage;
<div n="lb"/>was honoured by Śurasenas and Yādavas.<sup>3</sup> During his rule,
<div n="lb"/>nowhere was heard rāja śabdha; ruled like Dharma himself,
<div n="lb"/>maintained castes and orders, earned the title of Aṣṭamaṇḍal-
<div n="lb"/>ādhipati; had an erudite assembly.<sup>4</sup> The jewel of the solar
<div n="lb"/>race. Sumatī brought forth a mass of flesh which ulti-
<div n="lb"/>mately through the blessings of Aurva was converted into
<div n="lb"/>60,000 sons.
