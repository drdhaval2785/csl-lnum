{%Vedhas%} (III)¦ — a name of Brahmā<sup>1</sup> (s.v.). He created
<div n="lb"/>a daughter Śatarūpā (Sāvitrī); she was so charming
<div n="lb"/>that he himself fell in love with her; her brothers like
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and she herself deplored the absurdity of a father
<div n="lb"/>marrying his daughter; the creator turned a deaf ear and all
<div n="lb"/>his attention became centred on her; to see her wherever
<div n="lb"/>she was he created more eyes on all his five faces; after order-
<div n="lb"/>ing his sons to take up the work of creation, he lived with
<div n="lb"/>Śatarūpā for years in the midst of the lotus flower unseen by
<div n="lb"/>others, like an ordinary human being. To him was born
<div n="lb"/>Manu Svāyambhuva also known as Virāṭ and Ādipuruṣa;
<div n="lb"/>from him were born the Vairāja devas and others;<sup>2</sup> grand-
<div n="lb"/>father of all the worlds.<sup>3</sup>
