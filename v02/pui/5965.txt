{%Diti%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Dakṣa, and wife of Kaśyapa.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Her sons generally known as Daityas. Mother of
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu.<sup>2</sup> Mother of Dantavaktra
<div n="lb"/>by the sage's curse.<sup>3</sup> Her sons Prahlāda and Hari were
<div n="lb"/>devotees of Hari.<sup>4</sup> Always set her mind on truth;<sup>5</sup> daughter
<div n="lb"/>Simhikā;<sup>5a</sup> (Ādity-{%Vā. P.%}). Finding her sons slain by
<div n="lb"/>Hari to help Indra, she became enraged, and asked her
<div n="lb"/>husband to bless her with a child to kill Indra. The un-
<div n="lb"/>willing husband offered it on condition of her observing
<div n="lb"/>certain vows for 100 years. So she observed them and
<div n="lb"/>Indra came to assist her. One day he found her sleep-
<div n="lb"/>ing in an unorthodox posture and entering her womb cut
<div n="lb"/>the embryo into seven and then into 49 pieces; but
<div n="lb"/>at her request he gave all of them the status of gods,
<div n="lb"/>known as Maruts.<sup>6</sup> Impelled by passion and desire for
<div n="lb"/>children she approached her husband one evening for
<div n="lb"/>sexual intercourse. Kaśyapa said that it was the hour
<div n="lb"/>when Śivagaṇas moved about and for him, to offer the
<div n="lb"/>{%Śandhya%}-prayer. But she persisted and gained her object.
<div n="lb"/>She however requested to be redeemed of the sin. Kaśyapa
[Page2-088+ 34]
<div n="lb"/>remarked that since she approached him at the wrong time,
<div n="lb"/>her sons would have paiśāca-character and would be killed
<div n="lb"/>by Hari. For her penitence she was blessed with a
<div n="lb"/>righteous child among her grandsons.<sup>7</sup> Held the {%tejas%} in
<div n="lb"/>embryo for a hundred years when darkness enveloped all
<div n="lb"/>directions. The two door-keepers of Vaikuṇṭha cursed by
<div n="lb"/>seers for preventing them from having {%darsan%} of Hari were
<div n="lb"/>born as her two sons, when there were evil omens.<sup>8</sup> Prayed
<div n="lb"/>for another son. This was Vajrānga who on his birth accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to her orders bound Indra. The latter was released on
<div n="lb"/>the mediation of Brahmā and Kaśyapa.<sup>9</sup> Mother of Daityas;
<div n="lb"/>a Mother Goddess to be worshipped in house and palace
<div n="lb"/>buildings<sup>10</sup> Yoganidrā addressed as;<sup>11</sup> sons of, in the
