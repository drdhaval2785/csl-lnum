{%Śiva%} (I)¦ — (also Giritra): several names of the god are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned: master of all Gaṇas and Bhūtas, and a god of
<div n="lb"/>wrath, worshipped for learning;<sup>1</sup> Parīkṣit compared to him
<div n="lb"/>for liberality in granting boons: awarded his own missile to
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna: a great Yogin. Resident of Kailāsa; worships San-
<div n="lb"/>kaṛṣaṇa in Ilāvṛta.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Met by Pracatas and venerated by Kṛṣṇa; knew Vāsu-
<div n="lb"/>deva's glory and the dharma ordained by Hari;<sup>3</sup> pleased with
<div n="lb"/>Bāṇa, guarded his city, and fought with Kṛṣṇa. Insulted by
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa and Bhṛgu in the sacrifice of Prajāpatis: warned Satī
<div n="lb"/>against attending Dakṣa's sacrifice where he was deprived of
<div n="lb"/>his share. Heard from Nārada of Satī's sacrifice and grew
<div n="lb"/>angry, out sprang Vīrabhadra to ruin the sacrifice; cut off
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa's head; waited on by Brahmā and consoled, agreed to
<div n="lb"/>attend and praised Viṣṇu, and felt obliged to him.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Appeared before the Pracetasas and initiated them into
<div n="lb"/>the Rudragītā in glory of Hari and left them;<sup>5</sup> praised Aditi
<div n="lb"/>and Vāmana's exploits and was present when he was
<div n="lb"/>anointed Upendra;<sup>6</sup> praised Nṛsimha, and prayed to, by
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda. His discomfiture at Maya who built three cities for
<div n="lb"/>the safety of the Asuras. Them he killed. But Maya brought
<div n="lb"/>back all of them to life by the immortalised waters which he
<div n="lb"/>discovered in a well. Śiva was worried when Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>Hari drank the whole of the liquid. Induced by them he
<div n="lb"/>attacked Tripura with success.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>Accompanied Brahmā and other gods when they went
<div n="lb"/>to meet Hari Ajita. Praised by Prajāpatis for consuming
<div n="lb"/>hālāhala that came out of Amṛtamathana. His faces re-
<div n="lb"/>present five Upaniṣads from which thirty-eight {%mantras%}
<div n="lb"/>evolved, Himself being the Highest Truth. The poison got
[Page3-422+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>stuck in his throat and added beauty to his neck. Heard
<div n="lb"/>with wonder the Mohinī form of Hari and came with Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>to see him. Requested Hari to show himself again as Mohinī.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the lovely form Śiva became enamoured and ran after
<div n="lb"/>her when his seed dropped in several places which ultimately
<div n="lb"/>became shrines of images of gold and silver. Then he realis-
<div n="lb"/>ed his position and after taking leave of Hari, went to his
<div n="lb"/>abode;<sup>8</sup> embraced Pārvatī sitting on his lap in the midst of
<div n="lb"/>his attendants. This was seen by the Vidyadhara Citraketu
<div n="lb"/>who laughed at it. So he was cursed by Pārvatī to be born
<div n="lb"/>an Asura. When Śiva appealed to her that Citraketu was
<div n="lb"/>Hari's friend, Pārvatī became mild;<sup>9</sup> had a special park in
<div n="lb"/>which he sported with Pārvatī. Waited upon by Vasiṣṭha, he
<div n="lb"/>agreed to let Sudyumna be a male and female in alternate
<div n="lb"/>months;<sup>10</sup> did not comprehend Hari's māyā and advised
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas pursued by Cakra to go to Hari: prayed to by
<div n="lb"/>Bhagīratha, offered to bear the waters of the Ganges descend-
<div n="lb"/>ing from Heaven after washing the feet of Hari. Joined the
<div n="lb"/>gods in the Tārakāmaya war;<sup>11</sup> worshipped as Paśupati in
<div n="lb"/>Ambikāvana: propitiated with goats in Dhanuryāga, went to
<div n="lb"/>Hari with Brahmā and attended on Him.<sup>12</sup> Easily pleased by
<div n="lb"/>devotees shows grace to them unlike Hari: backed by Śakti
<div n="lb"/>and full of three guṇas — Vaikārika, Taijasa and Tāmasa,
<div n="lb"/>granted Asura Vṛka what he wanted for his tapas by cutting
<div n="lb"/>flesh from his body viz — that he on whose head he placed
<div n="lb"/>his hand should die. He wanted to experiment it on Śiva
<div n="lb"/>himself who took to flight to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="P"/>Hari is nirguṇa and apart from Prakṛti. In the role of
<div n="lb"/>a young Brahmacārin, Hari appeared before Vṛka and said
<div n="lb"/>that owing to curse of Dakṣa his words would not come true.
<div n="lb"/>As a test he could try it on himself. The wicked Asura did
<div n="lb"/>so and died to the relief of Śiva. Śiva welcomed his brother
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu but the latter did not appreciate it;<sup>13</sup> worshipped by
<div n="lb"/>Sudakṣiṇa, told him of a means to end the slayer of his father.
<div n="lb"/>Attended Varuṇa's sacrifice and Yudhiṣṭhira's; gave Śālva
<div n="lb"/>an aerial car capable of creating illusion.<sup>14</sup> Arjuna blessed by
[Page3-423+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>Śiva when he called on Him at Kailāsa, during the battle. In
<div n="lb"/>answer to his prayer, Śiva protected the delivery room of the
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā Brahman;<sup>15</sup> worshipped by Kṛṣṇa who was blessed
<div n="lb"/>with a son Pradyumna: burnt down Kāma who was reborn
<div n="lb"/>as Pradyumna. Pleased with tapas of Rukmi, he gave him a
<div n="lb"/>bow: Rode on his bull against Kṛṣṇa taking Pārijāta from
<div n="lb"/>Indra's abode but Garuḍa vanquished the bull and made
<div n="lb"/>Śiva go back.<sup>16</sup> At Bāṇa's city he produced {%maheśvara%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jvara%} which was averted by Vaiṣṇava {%jvara.%} Seeing Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>chopping all the arms of Bāṇa except four, Śiva pleaded for
<div n="lb"/>his life to which Kṛṣṇa agreed. On this Śiva approved of the
<div n="lb"/>marriage of Uṣā with Aniruddha. Went with Brahmā to
<div n="lb"/>encourage Devakī;<sup>17</sup> wondered at Mārkaṇḍeya's vrata and
<div n="lb"/>was pleased with his bhakti.<sup>18</sup> Śrīśaila and Gokarṇa are
<div n="lb"/>shrines sacred to Him.<sup>19</sup> (See Nilakaṇṭha for the legend) of
<div n="lb"/>three eyes, riding on bull, holding Pināka bow, equal to
<div n="lb"/>Nandi in strength, attended by Yakṣas, Piśācas, Bhūtas and
<div n="lb"/>Vināyakas: holding the moon on the tuft. Four faces repre-
<div n="lb"/>senting Indra, Yama, Varuṇa and Moon: creator of
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, Maruts, Aśvins, Sādhyas, Vidhyā-
<div n="lb"/>dharas, Nāgas, Cāraṇas and Vālakhilyas. Decked with sacred
<div n="lb"/>ashes, tiger skin for sacred thread;<sup>20</sup> Jyotirliṅga is māheśva-
<div n="lb"/>ram balam, the mahāyogam;<sup>21</sup> cursed by sages of Dāruvana
<div n="lb"/>for enticing their women-folk by his appearing naked, to
<div n="lb"/>become an ass and to lose his liṅgam. Darkness overtook
<div n="lb"/>the world. Brahmā advised sages to worship Śiva in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a Liṅga. The establishment of Liṅga cult, Śiva represents
<div n="lb"/>Agni and Ambikā Moon. Bhasma the vīrya of the Lord;<sup>22</sup> on
<div n="lb"/>the significance of pāśupata yogam.<sup>23</sup> Appeared to Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma doing penance in the guise of a hunter: blessed Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma with an axe to aid Devas;<sup>24</sup> committed brahmicide
<div n="lb"/>by cutting off Brahmā's head, taught astra and sāstra to him.
<div n="lb"/>Assumes Rudrahood at the end of Kalpa.<sup>25</sup> A pose of five
<div n="lb"/>faces and ten hands.<sup>26</sup> Brahmā's praise of: Śukra's praise of
<div n="lb"/>Became Ardhanārīśvara by worshipping Śakti.<sup>27</sup> Praise by
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa.<sup>28</sup> Blessed Bhaṇḍa with an unrivalled rule of 6000
<div n="lb"/>years.<sup>29</sup> As Kāmeśvara, he married Kāmeśvarī receiving wed-
[Page3-424+ 24]
<div n="lb"/>ding presents from all gods present.<sup>30</sup> Married Gauri through
<div n="lb"/>the intervention of the seven sages and lived in Oṣadhiprastha
<div n="lb"/>city of his father-in-law. Wandered with her passing from
<div n="lb"/>one hill to the other. Once unable to hear his vīrya Gauri,
<div n="lb"/>left it with Agni who placed it with Kṛttikas who offered it
<div n="lb"/>to Gangā, who deposited it in the Saravana forest.<sup>31</sup> A son of
<div n="lb"/>Atri;<sup>32</sup> from his eyes came silver;<sup>33</sup> constituting Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, Arka and Rudra and Vasus; this mūrti is Vāsudeva.<sup>34</sup>
