{%Ila%}¦ — the eldest son of Vaivasvata Manu; born of
<div n="lb"/>{%Putreṣṭi;%} anointed by Manu going to Mahendra hill for
<div n="lb"/>{%tapas;%} set out for {%digvijaya,%} when he reached Śaravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>gardens where Umā was sporting with {%Śiva.%} There was a
<div n="lb"/>curse by which a male who entered the garden was turned
<div n="lb"/>into a female. So Ila became {%Ilā.%} Bewildered Ilā was wan-
<div n="lb"/>dering and was met by Budha, Soma's son. She agreed to
<div n="lb"/>be his partner and followed him. Ikṣvāku and his brothers
<div n="lb"/>were concerned at their missing Ila and were told by Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>of his whereabouts. On Vasiṣṭha's advice, Ikṣvāku per-
<div n="lb"/>formed an {%Aśvamedha,%} as the result of which Ila would be
<div n="lb"/>a Kimpuruṣa for a month and Ilā for the next alternately.
<div n="lb"/>As Ilā, she gave birth to Purūravas, the first of the lunar race.
<div n="lb"/>In a way Ila was responsible for the two dynasties — solar
<div n="lb"/>and lunar.
<div n="P"/>M. 11. 40-66; 12. 1-14.
