{%Nīdāgha%}¦ — son of Pulastya; initiated into {%jñāna%} by
<div n="lb"/>Ṛbhu. Engaged himself in austerities for a thousand years
<div n="lb"/>in a grove in Vīranagara on the banks of the Devikā. After
<div n="lb"/>this period at the time of taking meals, Ṛbhu appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him, but was not recognised. Being requested for
<div n="lb"/>meals, Ṛbhu agreed on condition that he would be served
<div n="lb"/>with sweet viands. After meals, he found that he was his old
<div n="lb"/>master, and was overjoyed. He went away, and Nīdāgha
<div n="lb"/>continued his austerities for another 1000 years. At the end
[Page2-256+ 33]
<div n="lb"/>of this period Ṛbhu appeared and saw him standing aloof
<div n="lb"/>from a crowd witnessing the king riding on his elephant.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛbhu asked him who was the king and who was the elephant.
<div n="lb"/>Nidāgha said that the man above was king and that below the
<div n="lb"/>elephant. Ṛbhu asked him what he meant by above and
<div n="lb"/>below. Little knowing that he was his master, Nīdāgha
<div n="lb"/>jumped on him and remarked he was above and Ṛbhu below.
<div n="lb"/>Finding that Nīdāgha had not attained full maturity in
<div n="lb"/>{%advaita,%} Ṛbhu once again initiated him and departed. From
<div n="lb"/>that day Nīdāgha looked upon anything without any distinc-
<div n="lb"/>tion.
<div n="P"/>Vi. II. chh. 15 and 16.
