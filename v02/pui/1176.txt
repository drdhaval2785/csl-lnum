{%Ājagara%}¦ — a sage. Praḥlāda saw him one day lying on
<div n="lb"/>the bare ground on a cliff of the Sahya hills, and bowed to
[Page1-149+ 25]
<div n="lb"/>him. Praḥlāda asked the sage how he who had no com-
<div n="lb"/>forts was able to maintain a sound body. The sage replied
<div n="lb"/>that he had renounced all desires, learning renunciation
<div n="lb"/>from the bee and contentment from the serpent, while his
<div n="lb"/>mind was ever absorbed in Hari.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. VII. 13. 11-18, 20-45.
