{%Gayāsura%}¦ — had a stone over his head on which Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>performed sacrifices; Gaya performed yāga in Śvetakalpa-
<div n="lb"/>vārāha; after him the name for the place; the son who goes
<div n="lb"/>to Gayā, he who resides at Gayā for three pakṣas
[Page1-518+ 42]
<div n="lb"/>purifies seven descendants; or residence at least for 15, 7
<div n="lb"/>or 3 days; one offers piṇḍa with {%tila%} to forefathers and to
<div n="lb"/>oneself; the four heinous offences are expiated with the
<div n="lb"/>ritual at Gayā.
<div n="P"/>Out of the navel of Viṣṇu came Brahmā who created
<div n="lb"/>Asuras one of whom was Gaya, 125 yojanas in length and
<div n="lb"/>60 in breadth; a Vaiṣnava; performed {%tapas%} at Kolāhala hill
<div n="lb"/>for 1000 of years;<sup>1</sup> all gods went to Viṣṇu. Gayāsura
<div n="lb"/>with whom Viṣṇu was pleased was granted his request, to
<div n="lb"/>be the best of all; Yamapuri became vacant; all went to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and he went to Viṣṇu; on the latter's advice Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>went to Gayā and wanted to perform yāga on his body; a
<div n="lb"/>true devotee, Gaya agreed readily. But finding him un-
<div n="lb"/>stable Brahmā ordered Dharma to place a stone on his head
<div n="lb"/>and the devas to stand to maintain balance; Viṣnu was again
<div n="lb"/>approached who gave his mūrti and finding Gaya still un-
<div n="lb"/>stable Gadādhara himself took his stand and made the stone
<div n="lb"/>motionless. Pleased, Viṣṇu gave him what he desired. It
<div n="lb"/>was that they should all live there and that the people who
<div n="lb"/>did rites there must reach Brahmaloka. See Gayā tīrtham.
