{%Bharata%} (I)¦ — (Jaḍa): the eldest of the hundred sons
<div n="lb"/>of Ṛṣabha (Nābhi) and Jayantī; was devoted to Nārāyaṇa;<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a Mahābhāgavata; married Pāñcajanī, daughter of Viśvarūpa
<div n="lb"/>and she gave birth to five sons; was installed on the throne;
<div n="lb"/>protected his subjects righteously and performed {%yajñas%} by
<div n="lb"/>the method of Cāturhotra; having spent a million years thus
<div n="lb"/>he divided his property among his sons and placed Sumati on
<div n="lb"/>his throne; he left for the hermitage of Pulastya as a hermit
<div n="lb"/>and became constant in the worship of Hari; gave up his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom and sought refuge in Hari;<sup>2</sup> a sage;<sup>3</sup> one day when
<div n="lb"/>sitting on the bank of the river Cakranadī he saw a deer
<div n="lb"/>coming to the river and quenching her thirst; hearing a lion
<div n="lb"/>roar near by the deer took a leap when the young one slipped
<div n="lb"/>from her womb into the water and the deer herself fell
<div n="lb"/>dead; seeing this helpless one of a deer, Bharata loved it and
<div n="lb"/>brought it up as his own son; out of strong attachment to it
<div n="lb"/>he was born as a deer when he remembered his past life and
<div n="lb"/>was full of remorse; gave up his body by falling into the
<div n="lb"/>waters;<sup>4</sup> next he was born as the son of a Brahmana of the
<div n="lb"/>Angirasa line and with {%upanayana%} the father taught him
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature; on his parents' death his brothers found
<div n="lb"/>him mad and unpractical and appointed him to work in the
<div n="lb"/>fields; once a certain Vṛṣala chieftain wanted to offer human
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice to Bhadrakālī and finding that the victim had escap-
[Page2-538+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>ed, his attendants took this Jaḍabharata by force for sacrifice;
<div n="lb"/>at the point of his being sacrificed, Kālī who knew the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmana's spiritual virtue appeared in a ferocious form
<div n="lb"/>and cutting off the heads of all, rescued Bharata;<sup>5</sup> once on
<div n="lb"/>his way to sage Kapila, King Rahūgaṇa felt the need for a
<div n="lb"/>palanquin-bearer and seeing Bharata the dull-witted at a
<div n="lb"/>distance on the banks of the Ikṣumatī, asked him to bear
<div n="lb"/>his palanquin; finding it carried irregularly causing in-
<div n="lb"/>convenience to him the haughty king chastised the Brahmana
<div n="lb"/>and threatened him with punishment; to this Bharata made
<div n="lb"/>a learned reply that all his remarks were true and nothing
<div n="lb"/>would harm one who had realised himself; on this the king
<div n="lb"/>free from haughtiness, thought that he was a yogin, and
<div n="lb"/>perhaps Kapila incognito; so he asked him who he was;
<div n="lb"/>Bharata spoke on mind and its eleven courses modified by
<div n="lb"/>{%māyā%} as obstacles to the dawn of knowledge; he continued
<div n="lb"/>to say that what was important was {%jñāna%} or knowledge
<div n="lb"/>which could be acquired by association with great and detach-
<div n="lb"/>ed men; in his own case he got defeated in his purpose by
<div n="lb"/>attachment to a deer.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bharata described in metaphysical language {%samsāra%} as
<div n="lb"/>a forest, and the {%jivas%} as a company of travelling merchants
<div n="lb"/>now meeting a Gandharva and now devils, now gathering
<div n="lb"/>wealth and now robbed of it; he then explained the implica-
<div n="lb"/>tions of {%samsāra%} in plain language and said that the quest
<div n="lb"/>after desires and pleasures led one to acquire more {%karma%}
<div n="lb"/>and sow the seeds for a further cycle of births and deaths;<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>was succeeded as king by his son Sumati,<sup>8</sup> Manu so-called
<div n="lb"/>for sustaining the people; after him the Varṣa came to be
<div n="lb"/>known as Bhārata;<sup>9</sup> desirous of the territory on earth.<sup>10</sup>
