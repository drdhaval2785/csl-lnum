<div n="lb"/>brother of Rukmiṇī, and enemy of Kṛṣṇa; capital Bhojakaṭa;
<div n="lb"/>wanted to give his sister Rukmiṇī to Caidya, though his
<div n="lb"/>brothers were for Kṛṣṇa.<sup>1</sup> Followed Kṛṣṇa running with his
<div n="lb"/>sister and near the Narmadā fought with him. On an appeal
<div n="lb"/>from Rukmiṇī to spare his life, Rukmi was put to shame
<div n="lb"/>by the removal of his locks of hair and moustache and tied
<div n="lb"/>to his chariot; could not reconcile himself with Kṛṣṇa's action
<div n="lb"/>and resolved to kill Kṛṣṇa and then enter Kuṇḍina.
<div n="lb"/>Released by Balarāma, he built and lived in Bhojakaṭa with-
<div n="lb"/>out going back to Kuṇḍina.<sup>2</sup> Was met by Śālva at Kuṇḍina;

<div n="lb"/>and on the eastern side during the siege of Gomanta.<sup>3</sup> Gave
<div n="lb"/>his daughter to Pradyumna in marriage to please his sister,
<div n="lb"/>but continued to hate Kṛṣṇa; prayed to Śiva who gave him
<div n="lb"/>a bow saying that it would not harm Hari; went back to
[Page3-085+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>Bhojakaṭa, afraid of meeting Kṛṣṇa.<sup>4</sup> Gave his grand-
<div n="lb"/>daughter to Aniruddha in marriage. When he invited
<div n="lb"/>Rāma for a game of dice on the occasion, he played falsely
<div n="lb"/>and insulted Balarāma (s.v.) as a cowherd and forester at
<div n="lb"/>which he was struck dead. Kṛṣṇa passed no comments on
<div n="lb"/>his death out of consideration for his brother and Rukmiṇī.<sup>5</sup>
