{%Devayānī%} (I)¦ — the daughter of Śukra and Ūrjasvatī
<div n="lb"/>(Yajanī, Jayantī); accompanied Śarmiṣṭhā, the Asura king's
<div n="lb"/>daughter to water-sports; when Śarmiṣṭhā clothed herself
[Page2-122+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>with Devayānī's dress by mistake, Devayānī treated her as
<div n="lb"/>a slave, she being the daughter of a Brahmana Purohita. The
<div n="lb"/>Princess became enraged, stripped her and cast her into a
<div n="lb"/>well and went away; when she was crying helpless there
<div n="lb"/>came Yayāti who was on a hunting expedition. He gave her
<div n="lb"/>his upper cloth to wear and lifted her up. Devayānī request-
<div n="lb"/>ed him to be her husband, saying that she had been cursed
<div n="lb"/>by Kaca, Bṛhaspati's son, to marry only a Kṣatriya. Yayāti
<div n="lb"/>agreed and departed. Devayāni reported Śarmiṣṭhā's con-
<div n="lb"/>duct to her father Śukra who left the palace in disgust. The
<div n="lb"/>king implored him on his knees, when Śukra agreed to stay
<div n="lb"/>on if Śarmiṣṭhā would be appointed as servant of his
<div n="lb"/>daughter. This was agreed upon, and Śarmiṣṭhā became her
<div n="lb"/>servant. When Devayānī was married to Yayāti, Śukra
<div n="lb"/>presented Śarmiṣṭhā as his daughter's maid. She had two
<div n="lb"/>sons Yadu and Turvasu. Learning of her husband's connec-
<div n="lb"/>tion with Śarmiṣṭhā during her own pregnancy, Devayānī
<div n="lb"/>left for her father's house. Yayāti followed her and was
<div n="lb"/>cursed by Śukra to fall a prey to old age. Yayāti appealed
<div n="lb"/>to him to mitigate the curse as his desire for enjoyment with
<div n="lb"/>his daughter was still keen. Then Śukra said that if
<div n="lb"/>anyone would give him his youth and take up old age then he
<div n="lb"/>could regain his youth. His son Pūru agreed and once more
<div n="lb"/>the king enjoyed the company of Devayānī;<sup>2</sup> heard the story
<div n="lb"/>of an ewe loved by a ram from Yayāti, and thought it was
<div n="lb"/>an allusion to her; became detached and cast off her body
<div n="lb"/>with her mind on Hari.<sup>3</sup>
