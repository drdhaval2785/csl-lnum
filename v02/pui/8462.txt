<div n="lb"/>ten sons of Prācīnabarhiṣa and Sāmudrī; commanded by
<div n="lb"/>their father they engaged themselves in penance in the
[Page2-403+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>midst of the ocean and meditated on the teachings of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>given to them; leaving their home they proceeded to the
<div n="lb"/>west and in a park near a great lake heard the divine music;
<div n="lb"/>when listening to it, there appeared Śiva who on request
<div n="lb"/>initiated them in the meditation on Viṣṇu (Rudragītā);
<div n="lb"/>when Śiva left they meditated under the waters for 1000
<div n="lb"/>years. Viṣṇu appeared before them and promised them a
<div n="lb"/>son by asking them to marry the daughter of Kaṇḍu and
<div n="lb"/>Pramlocā; pleased with seeing the God they praised Him;
<div n="lb"/>after his disappearance they came out of the waters and
<div n="lb"/>seeing the earth filled with wild growth they began to burn
<div n="lb"/>the trees by breathing spiritual fire and wind from their
<div n="lb"/>mouth. Brahmā (Soma) interceded then and prevented
<div n="lb"/>them from further destroying the trees by offering Vārkṣi
<div n="lb"/>(Māriṣā) the daughter of the trees in marriage to them;
<div n="lb"/>they married her and she gave birth to Dakṣa on the eve of
<div n="lb"/>the Cākṣuṣa epoch.<sup>1</sup> After a long period of enjoyment of life
<div n="lb"/>they placed their wife under their son Dakṣa and went away
<div n="lb"/>to the western sea where Jajali attained siddhi; seeing them
<div n="lb"/>steadfast in devotion Nārada came there, and was welcom-
<div n="lb"/>ed by them; requested by them to be instructed to get rid of
<div n="lb"/>samsāra, Nārada advised them to worship and contemplate
<div n="lb"/>on Viṣṇu directly, and than departed; they did so and attain-
<div n="lb"/>ed the world of Viṣṇu;<sup>2</sup> sacrifice of, when Nārada sang
<div n="lb"/>praises of Dhruva;<sup>3</sup> worshipped for treasure.<sup>4</sup>
