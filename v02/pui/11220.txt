{%Yamunā%} (II)¦ — (personified) sister of Yama. Once
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma invited her for watersports, and got enraged at
<div n="lb"/>her delay. Hence he dragged her by means of his plough
<div n="lb"/>through Bṛṇdāvan. This changed her course; then she
<div n="lb"/>prayed for mercy which was granted. She presented Rāma
<div n="lb"/>with clothes and jewels. Even now the change in the
<div n="lb"/>course is noticeable.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 3. 50; Ib. ch. 65 (whole); Vi. V. 25. 8-11, VI. 8. 31.
