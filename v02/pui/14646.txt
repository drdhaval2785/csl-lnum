<div n="lb"/>and Ṛcīka) purchased by Rohita and used by Hariścandra as
<div n="lb"/>a sacrificial animal in the place of his son. Adopted as son
<div n="lb"/>by Viśvāmitra. When his first fifty sons refused to recognise

<div n="lb"/>blessed. He is Śuna to Bhṛgu family and Devarāta to the
<div n="lb"/>Gādhi line. His advent with the Kauśika family distin-
