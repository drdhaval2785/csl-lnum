<div n="lb"/>oblation to his manes, a fish fell into his hand which he
<div n="lb"/>put into his water vessel. Finding its rapid growth he
<div n="lb"/>placed it in a well, tank, Ganges and the sea respectively.
<div n="lb"/>From its abnormal growth he suspected it to be an asura
<div n="lb"/>or Vāsudeva; on questioning it he found it to be the Lord
<div n="lb"/>and was asked to use it (the fish) as the life boat when the
<div n="lb"/>whole world went down in the deluge, saving at the same
<div n="lb"/>time some lives;<sup>5</sup> performed {%tapas%} on the Yamunā for one

<div n="lb"/>worlds with towns;<sup>8</sup> divided the Vedas into four for the pro-
<div n="lb"/>gress of the world;<sup>9</sup> in order to get sons he performed the
<div n="lb"/>{%Mitrāvaruṇa%} ritual; owing to the {%hota's%} carelessness a
<div n="lb"/>daughter Ilā came out; she became again a male Sudyumna
<div n="lb"/>by name; by an imprecation of Śiva he again became a
<div n="lb"/>woman near Budha's hermitage. Budha got by her a son
<div n="lb"/>by name Purūravas;<sup>10</sup> interpretation of {%Śabdabrahma%} by.<sup>11</sup>
