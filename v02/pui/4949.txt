{%Janaka%} (I)¦ — (king of Mithīlā) one of the twelve sages
<div n="lb"/>who knew the nature of the {%dharma%} ordained by Hari. Son
<div n="lb"/>of Nimi, born by churning his dead body and hence known
<div n="lb"/>Mithila. He was Vaideha, born of a {%videha.%} He founded the
<div n="lb"/>city of Mithilā. His son was Udāvasu. Father of Sītā.<sup>1</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>his sacrifice Yājñavalkya won a prize for learning while
<div n="lb"/>Śākalya was humbled for pretended superiority. Father-in-
<div n="lb"/>law of Rāma.<sup>2</sup> In the Aśvamedha Yajña of his, Sākalya was
[Page1-623+ 35]
<div n="lb"/>ruined on account of his conceit by taking part in a disputa-
<div n="lb"/>tion; Janaka wanted to know the best among the learned
<div n="lb"/>assembled and set apart 11,000 crores, much gold, villages
<div n="lb"/>and servants to be given as present to him; in the disputa-
<div n="lb"/>tion each took part but Yājñavalkya ultimately threw out
<div n="lb"/>the challenge. Sākalya questioned this and put to him a
<div n="lb"/>number of questions which were all answered. Yājñavalkya
<div n="lb"/>in his turn put him a single question, a wrong reply to it
<div n="lb"/>inviting instantaneous death; Sākalya agreed, and unable to
<div n="lb"/>answer his question, was gathered to his ancestors;<sup>3</sup> told by
<div n="lb"/>the sage Asita what the Earth narrated to him about the
<div n="lb"/>ignorance of kings who without subduing themselves, try to
<div n="lb"/>subdue others.<sup>4</sup>
