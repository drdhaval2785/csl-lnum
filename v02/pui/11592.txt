{%Rājeyas%}¦ — the collective name for the hundred sons of
<div n="lb"/>Raji; the latter won over the Asuras and finally established
<div n="lb"/>Indra on the throne and retired for penance; his sons
<div n="lb"/>deprived Indra of his power when the latter appealed to
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati; he increased Indra's strength by rituals and made
<div n="lb"/>the Rājeyas adopt the Jīnadharma and hence got outside
<div n="lb"/>the pale of the Veda, when Indra easily overcame them and
<div n="lb"/>got back his kingdom; beginning of Jīna dharma and hetu-
<div n="lb"/>vāda.
<div n="P"/>M. 24. 35-49.
