{%Aṃbarīṣa%} (I)¦ — the son of Nābhāga. A devotee of Hari.
<div n="lb"/>The curse of Durvāsas proved ineffective in his case. Though
<div n="lb"/>lord of seven continents, Ambarīṣa knew that glory was
<div n="lb"/>perishable. He devoted himself to the service of Hari,
<div n="lb"/>and got to know the power of His {%yoga.%} A saintly king.
<div n="lb"/>Performed the {%Aśvamedha%} in a desert region so as to compel
<div n="lb"/>R. Sarasvati flow back towards it. Pleased with him, Hari
<div n="lb"/>presented his {%Cakra%} to him. He observed the {%Dvādasī%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vrata,%} for a year at the end of which he gave gifts to Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas and was preparing to feed them. There then came
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas who agreed to be fed. He went to the Yamunā
<div n="lb"/>for bath and was engaged in contemplating on Brahman.
<div n="lb"/>The time for breakfast came and the sage did not return.
[Page1-089+ 33]
<div n="lb"/>So the king broke his fast with only water and waited food
<div n="lb"/>expecting the sage's arrival. The sage on his return found
<div n="lb"/>that the king had broken his fast, and grew angry and created
<div n="lb"/>a flaming goddess to attack him. Hari's {%Cakra%} burnt her,
<div n="lb"/>turned towards the sage who ran everywhere and to the
<div n="lb"/>{%Trimūrtis%} in vain.<sup>1</sup> Advised by Hari, the sage apologised
<div n="lb"/>to the king who prayed to the {%Cakra%} and set the sage at
<div n="lb"/>liberty. The king who had not taken food requested him
<div n="lb"/>to accept his hospitality which Durvāsas gladly did. Bless-
<div n="lb"/>ing the king, the sage went back to Brahmaloka. Later the
<div n="lb"/>king bestowed his kingdom on his sons and retired to the
<div n="lb"/>forest for a life of penance and prayer.<sup>2</sup> Had three sons
<div n="lb"/>Virūpa and others.<sup>3</sup> A {%mantrakṛt%} who made the 16 great
<div n="lb"/>gifts.<sup>4</sup>
