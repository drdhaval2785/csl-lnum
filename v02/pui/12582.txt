{%Vārāṇasī Māhātmyam%}¦ — Śiva addresses Pārvatī on, in
<div n="lb"/>taking her out and showing the grandeur and majesty of the
<div n="lb"/>forest and garden round about Kāśī; the place of Vidyā-
[Page3-198+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>dharas, Siddhas and Cāraṇas. Here Bhagavān Piṅgala
<div n="lb"/>became Gaṇeśvara and Kṣetrapāla and distributor of food
<div n="lb"/>to the residents in the city. He was originally a Yakṣa, son
<div n="lb"/>of Pūrṇabhadra. He devoted himself to severe austerities
<div n="lb"/>and was blessed by Śiva to be a Gaṇapati.<sup>1</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>{%Avimukta tīrtha%} for here Śiva is omnipresent and
<div n="lb"/>is never absent from there. All sinners who die here
<div n="lb"/>become Rudras in time. Śiva stands here like a pillar,
<div n="lb"/>motionless till the deluge. Every part of the city is holy.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>He who remains here for a month gets the benefit of observ-
<div n="lb"/>ing the Pāśupata vow. By living permanently one gets true
<div n="lb"/>emancipation. By giving up life at the Maṇikarṇikā ghat one
<div n="lb"/>secures the desired goal. Perpetual life in Kāśī leads one to
<div n="lb"/>union with Śiva.<sup>3</sup> Kāśī's importance on account of its sacred
<div n="lb"/>stream, the Ganges; survives all deluge; Śiva addresses Pār-
<div n="lb"/>vatī on the great glory of the kṣetram in terms of Parama-
<div n="lb"/>yoga, Paramagati and Paramamokṣa. It is a place where
<div n="lb"/>people of all {%varṇas%} attain immortality. Gifts of cow and
<div n="lb"/>other things in this city are always beneficial.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is the place where Śiva got rid of the curse of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>to roam about with a skull for having cut off the fifth head
<div n="lb"/>of the creator. Through the grace of Hari, the skull fell
<div n="lb"/>down in Kāśī and broke into a thousand pieces.<sup>5</sup> It is the
<div n="lb"/>burial ground of all the gods, the ground being the Avimukta
<div n="lb"/>temple. It is the seat of Brahmā. But it deludes non-
<div n="lb"/>devotees. Here Vedavyāsa resided for 12 years observing
<div n="lb"/>the vow of silence. At the end of the vow he felt hungry
<div n="lb"/>and asked for alms. None was able to feed him. When he
<div n="lb"/>was about to curse the city, Śiva and Pārvatī took the human
<div n="lb"/>form and entertained him to his satisfaction. Then Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>knew of his guests who remarked that a man of choleric
<div n="lb"/>temper like himself should not live in that city. But he
<div n="lb"/>was permitted to visit it twice a fortnight on Aṣṭami and
<div n="lb"/>Caturdaśī days.<sup>6</sup>
