{%Indrayāga%}¦ — performed every year by Nanda and other
<div n="lb"/>gopas to please Indra, the Lord of rains and hence conducive
<div n="lb"/>to {%Trivarga.%} Kṛṣṇa explained that rain was the work of
<div n="lb"/>nature, and that no credit went to Indra. So he persuaded
<div n="lb"/>them to worship cows, Brāhmaṇas and hills. So it hap-
<div n="lb"/>pened. Indra who was thus deprived of his {%bali%} grew wrath-
<div n="lb"/>ful and sent down a continuous heavy downpour of rain
<div n="lb"/>creating panic in the minds of gopas. Kṛṣṇa took hold of
<div n="lb"/>the hill Govardhana and held it aloft as an umbrella steadily
<div n="lb"/>for seven days. Astonished at this, Indra withdrew his
<div n="lb"/>rains and Govardhana was planted in its place.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 24 (whole); ch. 25. 1-28.
