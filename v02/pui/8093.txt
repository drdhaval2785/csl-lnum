{%Purūravas%} (I)¦ — (Aila) son of Budha and (Sudyumna
<div n="lb"/>in female form) Ilā; anointed king of Pratiṣṭhāna (Pra-
<div n="lb"/>yāgā) by Sudyumna when he retired to forest;<sup>1</sup> eager for
<div n="lb"/>territory;<sup>2</sup> having heard of his beauty from Nārada, Ūrvaśī
[Page2-356+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>desired to marry him; she met the king and offered to be
<div n="lb"/>with him under two conditions, that he would undertake to
<div n="lb"/>protect the two sheep in her custody, and never to show
<div n="lb"/>himself naked except at their sexual intercourse; agreeing
<div n="lb"/>to the conditions he enjoyed her company, going round the
<div n="lb"/>earth, and frequenting Caitraratha and other gardens; miss-
<div n="lb"/>ing Ūrvaśi, Indra asked his Gandharvas to fetch her back;
<div n="lb"/>at midnight they stole the sheep, and hearing their noise she
<div n="lb"/>induced Purūravas to recover them; the king who was
<div n="lb"/>then naked, went as he was and fetched them back; but
<div n="lb"/>Ūrvaśī seeing him naked left him; mad in love with her he
<div n="lb"/>followed her naked begging her to stay on; he found her
<div n="lb"/>playing in the Sarasvatī waters with five friends; on an
<div n="lb"/>appeal from him she agreed to sleep with him one day every
<div n="lb"/>year; but he was all anxious to have her for ever; on her
<div n="lb"/>advice he prayed to the Gandharvas who gave him accom-
<div n="lb"/>modation and an Agnisṭhālī; he left it on the way in a forest
<div n="lb"/>and went home; meanwhile Tretāyuga had commenced; he
<div n="lb"/>went to see his sthālī but found an aśvattha instead; there
<div n="lb"/>in order to get at Ūrvaśī he cut off a couple of branches
<div n="lb"/>{%(araṇi)%} and churned them; fire, Jātavedas came with the
<div n="lb"/>three Vedas who all became his sons; by this one Veda
<div n="lb"/>became three;<sup>3</sup> had six sons Āyu and others by Ūrvaśī;<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>finding she had gone once for all, he repented his action, got
<div n="lb"/>ashamed of his position as king and devoted himself to Hari;
<div n="lb"/>worshipped the Fire which was his son and reached the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva world; the story given as an example of the
<div n="lb"/>evils of bad association;<sup>5</sup> meets Pitṛs every New Moon
<div n="lb"/>day; a Kṣatriya mantravādin; ācārya of Sāmagas; originator
<div n="lb"/>of three sacred fires<sup>6</sup> of the Ikṣvāku line but originator of
<div n="lb"/>the lunar race and a Rājaṛṣi; the Ailas came into prominence
<div n="lb"/>in the Tretāyuga and declined in the Kali.<sup>7</sup> By meditating
<div n="lb"/>on the 108 names of the Devī scored success over his
<div n="lb"/>enemies;<sup>8</sup> as a result of {%tapas%} at the Himālayas in honour
<div n="lb"/>of Janārdana, became the lord of the seven Dvīpas; slew
<div n="lb"/>Keśī and other Asuras; was offered {%ardhāsanam%} by Indra,
<div n="lb"/>going to see him every day; paid more attention to Dharma
[Page2-357+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>and incurred the displeasure of Artha and Kāma; Initiated
<div n="lb"/>in {%Bharatanāṭya Śāstra%}<sup>9</sup> in Dvijagrāma, became the king
<div n="lb"/>of Madradeśa in the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara;<sup>10</sup> served
<div n="lb"/>Kūhu and Sinīvāli to obtain nectar from the moon for per-
<div n="lb"/>forming rituals to the Pitṛs; gained his wish by the blessings
<div n="lb"/>of Atri<sup>11</sup> and by {%tapas%} in the Himālayas.<sup>12</sup>
