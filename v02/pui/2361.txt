{%Kaca%}¦ — the son of Bṛhaspati; deputed by gods to learn
<div n="lb"/>{%Samjīvinī vidyā%} from Śukrācārya; offered himself as a
<div n="lb"/>disciple and admitted as a pupil by Śukra; conducted himself
<div n="lb"/>to the satisfaction of his teacher and his daughter Devayānī
<div n="lb"/>for a period of 500 years. Once while out in the woods
<div n="lb"/>tending Śukra's cows, the Asuras killed him and left his
<div n="lb"/>body to be devoured by dogs and jackals. The cows
<div n="lb"/>returned home but not Kaca. Devayānī suspected of foul
<div n="lb"/>play and reported his death. Śukra brought him back to
<div n="lb"/>life.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>On another occasion he went to the woods to gather
<div n="lb"/>flowers for Devayānī and this time the Asuras ground him
<div n="lb"/>to pieces and mixing them with {%surā%} offered it to Śukra
<div n="lb"/>who drank it. Again Devayānī persisted wanting him back
<div n="lb"/>to life. This meant Śukra's death for he had to come out
<div n="lb"/>by tearing open his belly. So he taught Kaca the {%Samjīvinī%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vidyā%} so that he might restore him after his revival. Thus
<div n="lb"/>he did and so he learnt the {%vidyā.%} After a sojourn of ten
<div n="lb"/>hundred years he returned with due leave from his teacher.
<div n="lb"/>Now Devayānī offered to marry him but he pointed out that
<div n="lb"/>it was not proper to marry his preceptor's daughter. So
[Page1-299+ 25]
<div n="lb"/>she cursed that he would not get the fruits of his {%vidyā%}
<div n="lb"/>and he retorted that she would not find a Brāhmaṇa husband
<div n="lb"/>but only a Kṣatriya. Returned to the gods who gave him
<div n="lb"/>a share in their oblations; put to death by Vṛṣaparvan's
<div n="lb"/>men.<sup>2</sup>
