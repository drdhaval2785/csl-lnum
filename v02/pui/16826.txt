{%Saudāsa%}¦ — also called Mitrasaha and Kalmāṣānghri;
<div n="lb"/>(Kalmāṣapāda-{%Vā. P.%}) son of Sudāsa; wife of Madayantī,
[Page3-702+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>became a Rākṣasa through Vasiṣṭha's curse. Once as he was
<div n="lb"/>hunting, he killed a demon. The latter's brother wanted to
<div n="lb"/>wreak vengeance on the king and in the guise of a cook,
<div n="lb"/>served human flesh to Vasiṣṭha. The sage knew this and
<div n="lb"/>cursed him to be a demon for 12 years. The king wanted
<div n="lb"/>to curse the sage in return but was stopped by his wife. The
<div n="lb"/>consecrated waters fell on his feet and blackened them.
<div n="lb"/>Wandering in the forest, he saw a Brahman couple engaged
<div n="lb"/>in amorous sports. As a demon he seized the Brahman
<div n="lb"/>and ate his flesh despite the lady's protest. She cursed the
<div n="lb"/>demon to meet with death in the sexual act and joined her
<div n="lb"/>husband on his funeral pyre: after 12 years he returned and
<div n="lb"/>longed for union with his queen. She refused remembering
<div n="lb"/>the curse of the Brahmana lady. So he appointed Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>to beget a son on his queen. As the child was seven years
<div n="lb"/>in pregnancy, Vasiṣṭha hit her stomach with a stone and the
<div n="lb"/>child was born. This was Aśmaka.
