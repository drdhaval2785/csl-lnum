{%Rāma%} (I)¦ — Balabhadra of the Yādava race and lord
<div n="lb"/>of Dvārakā. (Balarāma): brother of Kṛṣṇa and Subhadrā;
<div n="lb"/>See Baladeva; eldest son of Vasudeva by Rohinī; father of
<div n="lb"/>two sons; welcomed Kṛṣṇa to Dvārakā; asked by Kṛṣṇa to
<div n="lb"/>take one of the two heavenly chariots and get ready to fight
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha. Rāma blew his conch and began fighting
[Page3-072+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>under his palmyra ensign; defeated the enemies on all sides.
<div n="lb"/>Fastened Jarāsandha with ropes but Kṛṣṇa set him free;
<div n="lb"/>when Jarāsandha encamped on the Yamunā, was consulted
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛṣṇa; fought successfully Jarāsandha a third time and
<div n="lb"/>defeated Bāṇa's army; when about to give a death-blow
<div n="lb"/>to Jarāsandha, a voice from the welkin said “do not kill
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha; go back.” Thus Jarāsandha was allowed to go
<div n="lb"/>back to his city.<sup>1</sup> Honoured by the Yādhava sabha, went
<div n="lb"/>with Kṛṣṇa to the Gomanta hill; on the way met and bowed
<div n="lb"/>to Paraśurāma; helped Kṛṣṇa in killing Śṛgāla Vaśudeva and
<div n="lb"/>was welcomed by the citizens of Karavīrapura. Stayed in
<div n="lb"/>this city for four months and returned to Mathurā with his
<div n="lb"/>brother. Attacked by Jarāsandha's army, fled with Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>to Gomanta, pursued by Jarāsandha; reached Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>safe.<sup>2</sup> Married Revatī before the advent of Kali and hence
<div n="lb"/>very tall in appearance; with his plough he brought down
<div n="lb"/>her height to his level.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard of Kṛṣṇa going alone to Kuṇḍina and of the pre-
<div n="lb"/>parations of Caidya to fight him; went with his army to
<div n="lb"/>Kuṇḍina and was welcomed by its king: Attacked Caidya's
<div n="lb"/>party pursuing Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī on that account.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Went to Hāstinapura with Kṛṣṇa after the reported
<div n="lb"/>burning of the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī: Pursued Śatadhanvan
<div n="lb"/>with Kṛṣṇa and finding he had not the {%Syamanta%} in his
<div n="lb"/>person, sent Kṛṣṇa back to Dvārakā and himself to Mithilā
<div n="lb"/>as Janaka's guest; taught the use of the gadā (mace) to
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana. Did not agree with Kṛṣṇa in returning the
<div n="lb"/>jewel to Akrūra. Left for Videha after Satadhanvan's
<div n="lb"/>death.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>Attended Aniruddha's marriage at Bhojakaṭa where
<div n="lb"/>induced by Kalinga and other friends, Rukmin invited
<div n="lb"/>Rāma for a game of dice: in it, Rāma sometimes lost and
<div n="lb"/>sometimes gained. At his loss Kalinga laughed showing
<div n="lb"/>his teeth. When Rukmin played false it was referred to
[Page3-073+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>a mediator who was unfortunately Kalinga and who there-
<div n="lb"/>fore maintained that Rukmi was in the right. A voice
<div n="lb"/>from the air said: “Rukmi tells an untruth”. Without
<div n="lb"/>heeding to this Rukmi insulted Rāma as a forester and
<div n="lb"/>herdsman and new to the art of dice. Rāma got enraged,
<div n="lb"/>took the mace and vanquished Rukmi: next he pulled out
<div n="lb"/>the teeth of Kalinga making fun of him all the time: others
<div n="lb"/>fled in fear; returned to Dvārakā.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>His picture was among those drawn by Citrālekhā: In-
<div n="lb"/>vaded Bāṇa's city, fought with Kumbhāṇḍa and Kūpa-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa. Once drove to Vraja and spent two months there.
<div n="lb"/>During nights he sported and sang with Gopis on the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā drinking Vāruṇī and playing in the waters: changed
<div n="lb"/>the course of the river by his plough:<sup>7</sup> Yamunā (s.v.)
<div n="lb"/>presented him with clothes, and ornaments with which he
<div n="lb"/>shone brighter than ever.<sup>8</sup> Desire for more territory.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Wanted to give Subhadrā in marriage to Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>but Kṛṣṇa was for her marriage with Arjuna. The latter
<div n="lb"/>went to Dvārakā as an ascetic when Rāma one day invited
<div n="lb"/>him for {%bhikṣa.%} It was an opportunity for Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>Subhadrā to see each other. Arjuna carried her away on a
<div n="lb"/>festive occasion with Kṛṣṇa's consent. Rāma's wrath was
<div n="lb"/>pacified by Kṛṣṇa. Then he approved of the marriage and sent
<div n="lb"/>him presents.<sup>10</sup> Unable to recover the dead son of the Dvā-
<div n="lb"/>rakā Brāhmaṇa.<sup>11</sup> Founded the city of Govardhana on the
<div n="lb"/>upper regions of the Godāvarī in the northern part of the
<div n="lb"/>Sahya mountain.<sup>12</sup> The God of Love cursed to be born as
<div n="lb"/>the brother of Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā.<sup>13</sup>
