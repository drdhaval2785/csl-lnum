{%Madhu%} (XIV)¦ — a mind-born son of Lord Viṣṇu born
<div n="lb"/>with Kaiṭabha representing {%rajas%} and {%tamas%} qualities;<sup>1</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha shook the lotus stand of Brahmā in the navel of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu lying in waters after interview with Rudra; then
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appealed to Viṣṇu in fear; Bhū, Bhuva and
<div n="lb"/>Suva entered Brahmā; Viṣnu and Jiṣṇu fought with Madhu
<div n="lb"/>Kaitabha when Brahmā acted as arbitrator; the battle con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued for thousands of years; Brahmā entered into con-
<div n="lb"/>templation when Mohini or Viṣṇumāya appeared to the
<div n="lb"/>great grief of the Asuras; both were killed when Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>asked for permission to create four kinds of creatures; with
[Page2-611+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>a view to this he performed austerities when he was filled
<div n="lb"/>with rage and tears out of which came wind, bile and kapha
<div n="lb"/>besides poisonous serpents; Brahmā's grief knew no bounds,
<div n="lb"/>and he swooned and lost his life; when Rudra appeared in
<div n="lb"/>eleven forms out of his face, revived him and helped him in
<div n="lb"/>his creation as his son.<sup>2</sup>
