{@pratyāhāra@}¦, m. (also as misreading or var. for
<div n="lb">{@pravyā°@}, q.v.), in Dharmas 70 one of five ‘foods’; other-
<div n="lb">wise only four are listed in BHS and Pali, see s.v. {@kava-@}
<div n="lb">{@līkārāhāra@}; this seems to be an addition and its mg. is
<div n="lb">not clear; the Dharmas list is otherwise questionable.
