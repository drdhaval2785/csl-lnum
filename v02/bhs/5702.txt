{@gahanatā@}¦ (app. = Pali gahaṇa, below; cf. prec.),
<div n="lb">designates some sort of heresy: Śikṣ 172.3 (prose) idam
<div n="lb">agraṃ mithyādṛṣṭīnāṃ, yad uta gahanatā-dṛṣṭiḥ. Ed. note
<div n="lb">refers to Dhp. comm. iii.494.1 (on Dhp. 318 micchādiṭṭhi-

<div n="lb">nattā, {%from being taken by the heresy called gahaṇa%}; the
<div n="lb">domal ṇ suggests connexion with Skt. and BHS {@grahaṇa@},
<div n="lb">which Bendall says is also shown by the Tib. rendering,
<div n="lb">which he quotes as gziṅs pa (connecting it with ḥdzin pa).
<div n="lb">The Dhp. context suggests that it consists in taking what
<div n="lb">is sinful for no sin, and vice versa; perh. then lit. {%holding%}
<div n="lb">(perverse views on morals)? Unfortunately I find no other
<div n="lb">evidence for the heresy referred to, in either Pali or BHS.
<div n="lb">Bendall and Rouse: {%the chiefest of all false doctrine, that is,%}
<div n="lb">{%the heresy of clinging to the world%} (would this be called a
