{@samyaksaṃbuddha@}¦, m. (= Pali sammā-saṃ°), {%a%}
<div n="lb">{%perfectly enlightened one, a Buddha%}: passim, e.g. Mvy 5;
<div n="lb">Mv i.80.4; 96.9, 12; Senart, i note 404, alleges that this
<div n="lb">stem is used for {@samyaksaṃbodhi@}; most of his instances
<div n="lb">are dubious or false (e.g. his two SP citations are read
<div n="lb">°buddhatvaṃ, not °buddhaṃ, in KN); but in Mv ii.311.8
<div n="lb">the mss. are cited as reading °buddhāye (dat., = °bodhaye;
<div n="lb">prose).
