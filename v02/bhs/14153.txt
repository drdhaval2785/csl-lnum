{@Virūpākṣa@}¦ (= Pali Virūpakkha), ({@1@}) n. of one of
<div n="lb">the ‘world-guardians’, see s.v. {@mahārāja(n)@}; Viru° (m.c.)
<div n="lb">Samādh p. 42 line 4; guardian of the west, and lord of
<div n="lb">nāgas; doubtless intended by the nāga-king of this name
<div n="lb">Māy 247.18; ({@2@}) pl., used (as also in Pali) of nāgas, pre-
<div n="lb">sumably as followers of Virūpākṣa: Māy 221.15; ({@3@}) sg.,
<div n="lb">Virūpākṣaḥ (alone!) as final colophon, Sādh 601.4, perhaps
<div n="lb">meant as name of the author of the last section? (But
<div n="lb">the usual way in Sādh of indicating authors' names is
<div n="lb">something like kṛtiḥ plus gen. of the name.)
