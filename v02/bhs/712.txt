<div n="lb">(? see {@nigha, nīgha@}); occurs chiefly (in Pali literature,
<div n="lb">aside from commentarial etymologies, only) in the neg.
<div n="lb">form; ep. of Buddha, or at least of perfected saints. In

<div n="lb">{%free from evil%} (whether {%sin%}, pāpa, or {%misery%}, duḥkha) will
<div n="lb">suffice in all Pali and BHS occurrences. Regularly in lists
<div n="lb">of formulaic epithets which give little clue to a more
<div n="lb">precise mg.: LV 358.5; Mv ii.397.16; iii.400.2 (same vs
<div n="lb">in Pali Sn 534 with anigha); 418.14; Ud xxix.34; Gv
