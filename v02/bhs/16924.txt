{@sujāta-jāta@}¦, adj., in LV 77.16 (prose) {%agreeable%}, of
<div n="lb">sounds: °ta-śabdāś ca śrūyante sma, {%and%} (only) {%agreeable%}
<div n="lb">{%sounds were heard%}; so Tib., sgra skad sñan baḥi sgra dag
<div n="lb">kyaṅ; contrasting with ill-omened sounds (as of crows,
<div n="lb">jackals, etc.) just mentioned as abolished; here there can
<div n="lb">be no doubt of the mg. Cf. Pali Sn 548 paripuṇṇakāyo
<div n="lb">suruci sujāto cārudassano (of the Buddha). Perhaps in
<div n="lb">the same mg. sujātajātaḥ LV 112.12 (prose), in a list of
<div n="lb">epithets of Śākyamuni, {%agreeable%} (but Tib. here legs par
<div n="lb">skye bas skyes pa, quite literally, {%born by a good birth%}).
<div n="lb">Perh. also in LV 96.6; here, after the Bodhisattva's birth,
<div n="lb">(apsarases) bodhisattvamātaram upasaṃkramya sujāta-
<div n="lb">jāta-tām aklāntakāyatāṃ ca paripṛcchanti sma (Lefm.
<div n="lb">sujātajāte tām, but read with v.l. as above, and so in
<div n="lb">repetitions 8, 10, 12, 14); this, it seems, in view of the
<div n="lb">parallels, may well mean {%approached…and inquired as%}
<div n="lb">{%to her agreeable%} (physical) {%condition and state of having%}
<div n="lb">{%an unwearied body%}, despite Tib. bltams pa legs par bltam
<div n="lb">mam, lit. {%well-born born state%}, which Foucaux, not un-
<div n="lb">naturally, takes to refer to successful parturition; yet
<div n="lb">the BHS (with -jāta, not jāti) hardly supports this.
