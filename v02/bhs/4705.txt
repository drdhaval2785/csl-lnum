{@kāma-guṇa@}¦, m. pl. (= Pali id., defined as {%the objects%}

<div n="lb">regularly five in number, in some passages clearly under-
<div n="lb">stood as the objects of the five senses as in Pali; so Mv
<div n="lb">iii.417.2 pañca kāmaguṇe (n. pl.; read °ṇā?) loke manaḥ-

<div n="lb">'bhiratāḥ pañca-kāmaguṇa-sahagatayā tṛṣṇayā dahyatha;
<div n="lb">yet in Mv ii.116.17 pañca kāmaguṇāṃ (acc. pl.), specifically
<div n="lb">listed as nāṭyaṃ gītaṃ vāditaṃ tūryaṃ striyo; the fact
<div n="lb">seems to be that the phrase became a stock formula or
<div n="lb">cliché, often used without definite association with any
<div n="lb">list; so Mvy 5378, 7373 mentions the 5 kāmaguṇa, but
<div n="lb">never lists them (in 871 even the number 5 is lacking). The
<div n="lb">old tradition that they are the objects of the 5 senses
<div n="lb">never died out, however; see LaVallée-Poussin, AbhidhK.
<div n="lb">iii.86 note 2. With the number 5 they are mentioned SP
<div n="lb">78.12; 111.6; 213.6; LV 186.19; 215.3; Mv i.31.5; ii.170.13,
<div n="lb">etc.; without the number e.g. LV 45.4; 173.19 and 22
<div n="lb">(cited Śikṣ 204.7 and 10); Mv ii.142.5, 12.
