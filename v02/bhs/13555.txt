2 {@Vālikā@}¦ (text Bāl°), n. of a Licchavi woman; and
<div n="lb">{@Vālikāchavī@} (text Bāl°, with 1 ms. Bālika-, v.l. Pārika-
<div n="lb">lecchavī, which suggests that the second member was a
<div n="lb">form of the tribal name!), n. of a place donated by her
<div n="lb">to the Buddha and the order (identified by Senart with
<div n="lb">Pāli Vālikārāma, v.l. Vālukā°; Pali seems to know no
<div n="lb">Vālikā; the v.l. suggests the word for {%sand%}): Mv i.300.17,
<div n="lb">printed, bālikāye bhagavataḥ saśrāvakasaṃghasya bhak-
<div n="lb">taṃ kṛtvā Bālikāchavī niryātitā. Does the name of the
<div n="lb">place mean {%Vālikā's radiance%}, or {%having a covering of sand%}
<div n="lb">(the woman's name being secondarily based upon the
<div n="lb">place name)?
