{@vadya@}¦ (nt. ? = Pali vajja, which is usually derived
<div n="lb">from Skt. varjya, tho this is not used as a noun in this
<div n="lb">sense; if so, vadya would be a false Sktization of vajja,
<div n="lb">as in next), {%fault, sin%}: (read) aṇumātreṣu vadyeṣu bhaya-
<div n="lb">darśāvī Mv iii.52.1 = Pali aṇumattesu vajjesu bhayadas-
<div n="lb">sāvī (see CPD s.v. aṇumatta), {%seeing danger in%} (even)
<div n="lb">{%very small faults%}; a common phrase in Pali; since Pali
<div n="lb">vajja is common in other locutions, there seems no doubt
<div n="lb">that we must read vadyeṣu; mss. corrupt, °mātreṣevadyeṣu
<div n="lb">or °mātreṣvabandheṣu; Senart em. °mātreṣv āvadyeṣu
<div n="lb">(intending Skt. avadyeṣu? this would seem plausible but
<div n="lb">for the close Pali parallel).
