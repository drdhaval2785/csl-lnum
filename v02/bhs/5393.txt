{@kṣepayati, (1)@}¦ {%spends, passes%} (time, with acc. kālam
<div n="lb">or some expression of time), is found in Skt. (BR 5.1349),
<div n="lb">and the simple kṣipati is commoner in that sense (ibidem).
<div n="lb">It is strange that Senart, Mv i.n. 492, PTSD on khepeti
<div n="lb">(s.v. khipati), and others have overlooked that fact, re-
<div n="lb">garded the usage as specifically Pali-BHS, and assumed
<div n="lb">confusion with kṣi, {%destroy%}. I have, to be sure, found no
<div n="lb">record of kṣepayati used absolutely in this sense in Skt.,
<div n="lb">as it is in LV 276.11 (vs) brahmaśakrabhavane nityaṃ
<div n="lb">sukhaṃ kṣepituṃ, {%to spend%} (time) {%happily forever in the%}
<div n="lb">{%home of B. and Ś%}. ({@2@}) {%exhausts, brings to an end, obliterates%};
<div n="lb">here influence of kṣi, {%destroy%}, might more reasonably be
<div n="lb">suspected, yet Skt. kṣip is sometimes used in nearly or
<div n="lb">quite the same sense, BR s.v. kṣip 7 (2.549; but as BR
<div n="lb">suspected, Mbh. Calc. 3.1094 should be read kṣīyeran,
<div n="lb">not kṣiperan, see Crit. ed. 3.30.30); it prob. is an extension
<div n="lb">of the meaning {%spend%} (time). So Divy 367.8 (narakaved-
<div n="lb">anīyāni karmāṇi) kṣepayitvā, {%having spent (exhausted)%}
<div n="lb">{%their deeds that had to be suffered-for in hells%}, which may
<div n="lb">illustrate the transition from {%spend%} (time) to {%exhaust%};
<div n="lb">the change is complete in LV 237.13 (vs) saptarātra
<div n="lb">bhaṇamānu…sā viyūha na pi śakya kṣepituṃ, {%tho%}
<div n="lb">{%described for a week, this splendor could not be exhausted%}
<div n="lb">{%(‘spent’)%}. But it is doubtful whether any of these uses
<div n="lb">are strictly non-Skt.
