{@nivāta@}¦, adj. (= Pali nivāta, given in Dictt. only as
<div n="lb">noun, but clearly adj. in MN i.125.6 nivātā Vedehikā

<div n="lb">{@sukhasaṃsparśa@}, qq.v., Mv i.350.6; ii.64.15; with
<div n="lb">akarkaśa, sukhasaṃvāsa, in similar description, Mv

<div n="lb">nāṃ or nirvāṇāṃ) in pralalita-(so mss.)-kalahaṃsa-barhiṇa-
<div n="lb">nivātā, of the Buddha's voice, {%gentle as the sweet%} (voice) of
<div n="lb">{%kalahaṃsa or peacock%} (?). I have some doubt of the em.,
<div n="lb">partly because nivāta seems not otherwise used of the
<div n="lb">voice, partly because I doubt whether the peacock's
<div n="lb">voice would be referred to in this complimentary way.
