{@lokākhyāna-kathā@}¦, Divy 304.27, and {@lokākhyā-@}
<div n="lb">{@yikā@}, 26, 29, {%story-telling about the world%}. Here a work-
<div n="lb">man tells entertaining stories to his fellow workmen.
<div n="lb">Certainly not {%philosophical discussion about%} (the creation,
<div n="lb">etc., of) {%the world%}, which is the scholastic interpretation
<div n="lb">of Pali lokakkhāyikā (e.g. DN comm. i.90.32; MN comm.
<div n="lb">iii.223.15), adopted in PTSD. I am not sure that this is
<div n="lb">not late commentarial pedantry; in the canonical and
<div n="lb">other early Pali texts, so far as I can see, the Pali word
<div n="lb">might have the mg. which it clearly has in Divy.
