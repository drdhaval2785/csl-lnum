{@pratikrośa@}¦ (m.? to next; cf. Pali paṭikkosana),
<div n="lb">{%rejection, scorn, disregard%}: °śena AsP 179.6 (prose; refers
<div n="lb">to action of 179.4, see next); {%rejection of, opposition to%},
<div n="lb">action in the saṃgha, MSV ii.210.5, 9 ff. In Mv ii.371.10
<div n="lb">(vs) Senart reads sukhito pramuditaḥ pratikrośaṃ pratila-
<div n="lb">bhati purimanirodhadṛṣṭaṃ, and interprets prati° as
[Page362-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">referring to the contempt and ill-treatment which pious
<div n="lb">men will accept with joy in the time of decadence of
<div n="lb">religion; but this does not seem a natural interpretation,
<div n="lb">and the mss. read, one, prītiḥ krośaṃ, the other prati-
<div n="lb">kośaṃ; combining parts of each we would get prīti-
<div n="lb">kośaṃ, {%a treasure-store of joy%}, which makes good sense
<div n="lb">and which I would read. The meter is very puzzling to
<div n="lb">me in this whole passage, so that I cannot rely on it.
