{@abhijānāti@}¦ (= Pali id.), ({@1@}) {%knows by%} {@abhijñā@}, q.v.
<div n="lb">The technical Buddhist meaning of the noun is certainly
<div n="lb">at times associated with the verb, which in Skt. means
<div n="lb">{%knows%} in a very general way. The extent to which the spe-
<div n="lb">cial Buddhist sense is present in the verb is often doubtful;
<div n="lb">I list a few cases where it seems pretty clear: abhijānāmi
<div n="lb">SP 200.8 (Burnouf and Kern, {%remember%}, I think wrongly);
<div n="lb">Mv i.57.7, 12; Gv 446.14; Vaj 34.20. The translation
<div n="lb">{%remember%}, also given CPD, is due to the fact that events
<div n="lb">of the past are often referred to; but I think the Buddha
<div n="lb">(the usual subject in such cases) {%knows%} them by {%super-%}
<div n="lb">{%natural knowledge%} or so-called {%intuition%} ({@abhijñā@}, q.v.),
<div n="lb">not by {%memory%}; ({@2@}) {%recognizes%} (as a duty), {%takes upon%}
<div n="lb">{%oneself%} (a vow or undertaking); so also in Pali, e.g. MN
<div n="lb">i.80.5 (definitions in Pali dictionaries including CPD
<div n="lb">hardly do justice to this mg.): LV 254.2 abhijānāmy
<div n="lb">ahaṃ…ekam evādvitīyaṃ kolam āhāram āhartum, {%I%}
<div n="lb">{%undertake to allow myself to eat only a single kola as food%};
<div n="lb">similarly LV 255.8, 15.
