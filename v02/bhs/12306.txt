{@maitrāsa-tā@}¦ (for *maitrāṃśa-tā, below; § 3.3), {%loving-%}
<div n="lb">{%kindness, benevolence%}, is the stem to be assumed Mv iii.373.11
<div n="lb">(vs), where read: maitrāsatāṃ (or °taṃ, MIndic for °tāṃ;
<div n="lb">mss. cited as °naṃ or °na; Senart em. maitrābhāvanāṃ,
<div n="lb">metr. impossible and otherwise implausible) bhāvaye
<div n="lb">apramatto, maitreṇa cittena hitānukampī, etc. The stem
<div n="lb">maitrāsa = Pali mettāsa, which occurs as v.l. for met-
<div n="lb">taṃso Itiv. 22.4; in the same vs Jāt. iv.71.25 mettaṃso
<div n="lb">is glossed 72.5 by metta-koṭṭhāso (for *koṭṭhaṃso!) met-
<div n="lb">tacitto; the word is a noun, not an adj. as stated in PTSD,
<div n="lb">and means the same as BHS maitrāsa-tā (for *maitrāṃ-
<div n="lb">śatā); otherwise BHS records only maitra (adj.) as separate
<div n="lb">word with {@aṃśa@} (q.v., 2) in the mg. of the cpd. The use
<div n="lb">of -āsa for -āṃśa (Pali -aṃsa) is confirmed by Pali koṭ-
<div n="lb">ṭhāsa.
