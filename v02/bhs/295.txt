<L>295<pc>009,1<k1>atitti<k2>atitti-(ga-
{@atitti-(ga-)@}¦ ? (= Pali id., Skt. atṛpti); assumed by
<div n="lb">Senart at Mv i.133.12 (prose) atittigāś (no ms. reads quite
<div n="lb">so, yet the variants seem indeed to tend in this direction),
<div n="lb">{%ils ne tendent pas à la satisfaction de leurs sens, ils ne sont%}
<div n="lb">{%pas esclaves de leurs sens%}. It seems to me, however, that the
<div n="lb">general use of derivatives of tṛp would suggest just the
<div n="lb">opposite meaning, which would not fit here (ep. of Bodhi-
<div n="lb">sattvas): {%they never reach satiety%}.
