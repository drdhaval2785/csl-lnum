[{@pratisārin@}¦, n. sg. °rī, {%regretful%} (for having given a
<div n="lb">gift), Karmav 65.4 dattvā ca khalu °rī bhavati. But one
<div n="lb">ms. is cited as reading ripuṇisārī, which points to viprati-
<div n="lb">sārī as the correct reading; this is confirmed by 66.7
<div n="lb">vipratisārī. This word is applied to one who, after giving
<div n="lb">something, regrets his generosity.]
