({@parihāṭaka@}¦, nt., Mvy 6020, and {@parihāraka@}, nt.,
<div n="lb">Mvy 6028 [in both = Tib. gdub bu, with addition of tham
<div n="lb">pa = pari in 6028] or °raka m., Mv ii.352.6 [°kāḥ, n. pl.,
<div n="lb">in vs]; in Mvy 6028 v.l. °harakaṃ, which Mironov reads
<div n="lb">without v.l.: {%bracelet%} [or {%anklet%}], acc. to Tib.; certainly
<div n="lb">some bodily ornament. The two are surely different forms
<div n="lb">of one word, which also appears in BHS as {@pārihāraka@},
<div n="lb">q.v. It occurs in Mbh. crit. ed. 1.67.2; 4.15.2 and 18.19,
<div n="lb">always following a parallel form of kuṇḍala, °hāṭaka in
<div n="lb">text [with most mss.] but always with v.l. °hāraka. Taken
<div n="lb">by BR 4.560 as noun, identical with Mvy °hāṭaka, but in
<div n="lb">7.1768 as adj., {%ganz von Gold%} [with kuṇḍala]; the existence
<div n="lb">of the v.l. °hāraka, and BHS pārihāraka, give support to
<div n="lb">BR's earlier interpretation, to which I adhere. See § 2.47.)
