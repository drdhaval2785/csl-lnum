{@? styayāntataḥ@}¦, LV 3.22 (vs), uninterpretable; the
<div n="lb">preceding pāda is, yasyāpy avandhyāv iha darśana-
<div n="lb">śravā; then, after this word (the only v.l. is °takaḥ in Calc.;
<div n="lb">s- could possibly be the ending of -śravā, n. pl. for dual)
<div n="lb">śāntavimokṣapāragaḥ; Tib. faithfully renders all the rest
<div n="lb">but omits this completely. All the three other pādas of
<div n="lb">the vs begin with relative pronouns referring to the Bo-
<div n="lb">dhisattva; I have thought of reading here yo 'yaṃ tataḥ,
<div n="lb">which makes good sense but is remote from the mss.
