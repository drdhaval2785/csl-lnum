{@ar(t)tiyati@}¦ or {@°tīyati, °te@}; in one doubtful passage
<div n="lb">perhaps ārtī°, otherwise always art° when not fused in
<div n="lb">saṃdhi with preceding vowel; forms occurring include
<div n="lb">ar(t)tīyati, °yanti, °tīyate, °tiyante, °tīyanto and °taṃ
<div n="lb">(pres. pple.), aritīyeran (! read art°), artita (ppp.); also
<div n="lb">ārtīyate (? v.l. attī°); attīyantā (and probably attīyate
<div n="lb">for prec.); ṛtīyate, °yante, °yamāna (pres. pple.; for ṛt°
<div n="lb">we usually find rit° written); ardīyamāna (pres. pple.);
<div n="lb">āstīryati; and noun {@attīyanā@}. The corresp. Pali (see CPD)
<div n="lb">is written aṭṭīyati, aṭṭhī°, aḍḍhī°, addiyati. Despite all
<div n="lb">this confusion, there is no doubt that we are dealing with
<div n="lb">essentially one word, with modifications due to diverse
<div n="lb">influences, including popular etymology and hyper-Sktism.
<div n="lb">Wogihara, ZDMG 58.454, gives the ‘correct form’ as
<div n="lb">ṛtīyate (which, or rather usually rit°, is customary in Bbh,
<div n="lb">but I believe occurs nowhere else), and the mg. as {%er%}
<div n="lb">{%schämt sich%}; both statements are wrong, I believe. As to
<div n="lb">mg., Wogihara was evidently influenced by the fact that
<div n="lb">the word is often associated in Pali with harāyati, jiguc-
<div n="lb">chati, and in BHS with jehrīyate, (vi)jugupsati, or equiv-
<div n="lb">alents. But it is also often used where {%shame%} cannot be
<div n="lb">involved. Most likely the MIndic word is a denominative
<div n="lb">from ārti (for which arti, with semi-MIndic shortening,
<div n="lb">is recorded even in Skt.). All forms are included here since
<div n="lb">the word is clearly a unit, but they are also entered under
<div n="lb">the several heading: ({@1@}) {%is grieved, perturbed, distressed%}:
<div n="lb">Mv i.219.17 = ii.21.19 kecit saṃsārapāśena arttiyante

<div n="lb">leading over to the next group, the additional note of
<div n="lb">{%aversion, revulsion%} seems more or less clearly present:
