{@bhāṅgaka@}¦, nt., Mvy 5882, or m., MSV ii.3.2, acc. to
<div n="lb">Tib. (in both) gso ras, app. {%worn-out%} or {%ragged garment%} (of
<div n="lb">cotton, ras). Perh., then, derived from Skt. bhaṅga (with
<div n="lb">BR). The surrounding terms designate garments of fine
<div n="lb">materials, and one is tempted to assume the mg. {%linen%}
<div n="lb">{%garment%} (Skt. bhaṅgā, adj. bhāṅga, {%hemp-en%}); and so
<div n="lb">Chin., clearly; but even if we assume that Tib. gso is an
<div n="lb">error for gos, {%garment%}, the word ras is said to mean only
<div n="lb">{%cotton%}.
