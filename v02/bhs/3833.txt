<div n="lb">{@thāna-@}. To be sure PTSD defines Pali upaṭṭhāpana by
<div n="lb">{%attendance, service%}; but in the only passage cited, Vin.
<div n="lb">iv.291.13, cf. the comm. 27, it certainly is causative:
<div n="lb">{%causing%} (someone else) {%to attend, wait upon%}. That meaning
<div n="lb">is impossible in Mv iii.37.5, 8, 12.]
