{@? upavitarka@}¦ (m.?), in Mv ii.74.3 °keṣu vā, at the
<div n="lb">end of a list of arts and exercises (in Mv almost wholly
<div n="lb">martial; LV p. 156 in corresponding passage includes many
<div n="lb">non-martial) in which the Bodhisattva challenges the
<div n="lb">other Śākya youths; preceded by rathasmiṃ vā dhanusmiṃ
<div n="lb">vā tharusmiṃ vā, which does not fit well with any intellec-
<div n="lb">tual exercise ({%reasoning%} or the like) such as the apparent
<div n="lb">etymology suggests.
