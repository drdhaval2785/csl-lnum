{@āsevaka@}¦, or {@°kā@}, some kind of garment: SP 283.9
<div n="lb">(vs), cited Śikṣ 352.13, āsevaka (unmetr.! one ms. and
<div n="lb">Śikṣ °kaṃ; WT with most mss. °kāṃ; Kashgar rec. °kā)
<div n="lb">kṛsna tathādaditvā. Tib. acc. to Bendall rdul gzan, {%dust%}
<div n="lb">{%garment%} (Jä. {%cloak%}, against dust on a journey), but acc.
<div n="lb">to WT, and my own copy of Tib. SP, rṅul gzan, which =
<div n="lb">{@saṃkakṣikā@}, q.v.; Burnouf and Kern {%woolen garment%};
<div n="lb">note that Tib. rdul and rṅul are very easily confused in
<div n="lb">writing; in MSV ii.52.5 āsevaka (ms., ed. em. āsīvaka)
<div n="lb">seems to mean {%patch%} (so Tib., lhan thabs kyis klan pa);
<div n="lb">in the next line, 6, sevakaṃ (ms., ed. em. sīv°) dattvā
<div n="lb">dhāraya, seems to show the same mg., and in 11 below,
<div n="lb">text āsīvakāṃs (by em.? ms. āsev° as before?) tu dattvā
<div n="lb">dhārayitvayam, confirms this mg. (reference is to materials
<div n="lb">unsuitable for making robes).
