<div n="lb">{@nīya@}; = Pali sārāṇīya, which Childers derives from the
<div n="lb">Skt. root smṛ, following standard Pali comms., e.g. MN
<div n="lb">comm. i.110.16 ff., ii.394.31 f., but this is certainly wrong;
<div n="lb">Kern, cited PTSD, rightly regards BHS saṃrañjana,
<div n="lb">°nīya, as the true original; all forms can be derived from
<div n="lb">this; saṃ- gave sā-, and for -rañja- was substituted first
<div n="lb">*-rāja-, both by § 3.3, then -rāya-, as in BHS, § 2.34;
<div n="lb">finally in Pali this -rāya- was contracted to the single
<div n="lb">syllable -rā-, Pischel 149, 150, cf. § 3.118, Geiger 20; the
<div n="lb">rare BHS saṃrajanīya, if not an error for saṃrañj°, may
<div n="lb">be derived from the unnasalized form of the same root
<div n="lb">raj), {%courteous, pleasing, polite, friendly%}: this form noted
<div n="lb">only in Mv iii.47.18 etc. (cited, with list of passages, s.v.
<div n="lb">{@saṃmodate@}; always °yāṃ kathām); in iii.394.14, however,
<div n="lb">mss. sāropaṇīyāṃ instead (Senart em.), and one of them
<div n="lb">also reads sāropayitvā for the following vyatisārayitvā.
