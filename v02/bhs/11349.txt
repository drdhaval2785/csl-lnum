{@bhojana@}¦ (cf. the cognate Skt., BHS bhoga, in this
<div n="lb">mg.; normally bhojana only {%food%}, in Skt., Pali, Pkt., and
<div n="lb">BHS), (carnal) {%enjoyment, sexual intercourse%}; only in
<div n="lb">phrase (or cpd.) sabhojana kula, {%a household in which%}
<div n="lb">{%sexual intercourse is going on%} or {%about to be practised%}; in
<div n="lb">such a house a monk is forbidden to ‘intrude’ (see {@anu-@}
<div n="lb">{@praskandati@}) and sit or stand: Prāt 511.8 (a Chin. version
<div n="lb">interprets as a house where man and wife engage, sc.
<div n="lb">habitually or excessively, in sexual intercourse); Mvy
<div n="lb">8465 sabhojanakula-niṣadyā, and 8466 °sthānam (Tib. ñal

<div n="lb">{%parations are being made to perform sexual intercourse%});
<div n="lb">so in Pali Vin. iv.95.7, interpreted in this way by both
