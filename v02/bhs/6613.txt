<L>6613<pc>242,2<k1>jitam<k2>jitam
{@jitam@}¦, apparently interj. or particle, chiefly in phrase:
<div n="lb">api hi jitaṃ Mv ii.126.9; iii.181.14; 206.10, 12; 209.12;
<div n="lb">this seems to be an expression of {%astonishment%}, something
<div n="lb">like {%Who'd have thought it ? That beats all!%} Once, in Mv
<div n="lb">iii.286.1, jitaṃ (v.l. jidaṃ) occurs by itself; the daughters
<div n="lb">of Māra, reporting to Māra, say: (any other man than
<div n="lb">the Bodhisattva, seeing us,) so jitaṃ mūrchitvā prapatiṣyad
<div n="lb">vā…cittakṣayaṃ vā prāpuṇe (but the B. was unmoved);
<div n="lb">here too {%astonishment%} might be the connotation of the
<div n="lb">particle; {%he, good heavens! would have fallen down fainting%}
<div n="lb">{%…, or lost his wits%}. No etymology is apparent for the
<div n="lb">word.
