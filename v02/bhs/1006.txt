{@anuvarga@}¦ (m. ? = Pali °vagga, see below), some part
<div n="lb">or accessory of a city gate: dvinnāṃ varṇānāṃ anuvargā
<div n="lb">abhunsuḥ (sc. teṣāṃ dvārāṇāṃ) Mv i.195.(11--)12. Cf.
<div n="lb">Pali Bv i.14 tulā saṃghāṭānuvaggā sovaṇṇaphalakatthatā.
<div n="lb">CPD interprets anuvaggā as adj., citing comm., = anurūpā.
<div n="lb">But this is proved wrong by Mv; like tulā, which occurs
<div n="lb">in the prec. line of Mv, it must be a part of a structure.
<div n="lb">See Senart's note for a conjectural attempt at interpreta-
<div n="lb">tion.
