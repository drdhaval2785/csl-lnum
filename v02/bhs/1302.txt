{@a-paritasyana@}¦ (or {@°nā@}), {@°na-tā@} (= prec.; neg. of
<div n="lb">n. act. to {@paritasyati@}, q.v. with discussion and references;
<div n="lb">cf. Pali aparitassana, °nā), {%non-exhaustion, lack of discoura-%}
<div n="lb">{%gement, not being wearied%} or {%troubled in spirit%}: aparita-
<div n="lb">syanābhimukhenākhedacittotpādena (so ms., ed. em.
<div n="lb">aparitrasya°) Śikṣ 25.7, {%not turned towards weariness%}
<div n="lb">(note a-kheda-); aparitasyanatayā, ms. at Śikṣ 35.6 for
<div n="lb">apariṇamanatayā which ed. reads with Gv 463.21 (the
<div n="lb">source of the citation; see {@pariṇamana@}); nausamacittena
<div n="lb">gamanāgamanāparitasyanatayā (so mss., ed. em. °trasya°,
<div n="lb">without good reason) Śikṣ 35.9, {%with mind like a ship%}
<div n="lb">{%because unwearied in going and coming%}; this is cited from
<div n="lb">Gv 464.6 which reads parikhinnatayā, certainly an error
<div n="lb">for {@aparikh°@}, a synonym of aparitasyana(tā), cf. akheda-
<div n="lb">above on Śikṣ 25.7, and s.vv. {@paritasyati, °tras°@}.
<div n="lb">Wogihara, Lex. 32 note 1, assumes that the original form
<div n="lb">of these nouns contained °tasy° and that (a-)paritasana
<div n="lb">(prec.) is a ‘purism’. This can hardly be assumed in view
<div n="lb">of Pali paritasati beside °tassati, and BHS {@paritrasati@}
<div n="lb">beside {@°syati@}.
