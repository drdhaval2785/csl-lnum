<div n="lb">{@laukika@}), {%super-worldly%}, esp. (but not invariably) said of
<div n="lb">a Buddha and all his aspects and activities, acc. to the
<div n="lb">{@Lokottaravādin@} school: °rasya Buddhasya Śākyamunino
<div n="lb">Mv i.48.15; °rā(ḥ), said of Buddhas, i.96.12; (na hi kiṃcit

<div n="lb">Buddha specifically called lok° Mv i.167.17, 18 (see s.v.
<div n="lb">{@niṣaṇṇa@}); 168.1, 2, 3, 4, 9; in Divy 161.25 no creature

<div n="lb">11) jñāna, and in 237.2--3 ff. pāramitā, are of three kinds,
<div n="lb">laukika (of worldly persons and heretics), lokottara (of
<div n="lb">śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas), and lokottaratama (of
<div n="lb">Bodhisattvas); here the word can hardly have its technical
<div n="lb">dogmatic meaning.
