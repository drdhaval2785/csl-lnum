{@kuta-lipi@}¦ (or, with v.l., {@kutana-lipi@}), some kind of
<div n="lb">script: Mv i.135.6. Senart thinks of reading kuṭa, referring
<div n="lb">to Kuṭaka as n. of a people, but this is recorded only
<div n="lb">once from the BhāgP., and seems implausible here. The
<div n="lb">word seems to correspond to {@kirāta-lipi@} of LV 125.21.
