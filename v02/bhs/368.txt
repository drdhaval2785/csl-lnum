{@atyudgacchati@}¦, and ppp. {@atyudgata@}, sometimes in
<div n="lb">texts and oftener in mss. (frequently as v.l.) for {@abhyud°@}
<div n="lb">in meaning {%rises%} (ppp. {%risen%}) {%above%}. Graphic confusion is
<div n="lb">certainly concerned here, at least in part; except as under
<div n="lb">{@atyudgata@}, q.v., all occurrences are grouped under
<div n="lb">{@abhyud°@}, q.v. For the most part Pali abbhuggacchati and
<div n="lb">derivatives support this classification. Note however
<div n="lb">(aside from Pali accuggata, apparently only used as adjec-
<div n="lb">tive, often with specialized meanings) Pali accuggamma,
<div n="lb">ger., used of water-plants, {%having grown out above%} (the
<div n="lb">water, acc. or abl.); but BHS uses (only) abhyudgacchati
<div n="lb">in this sense, according to unanimous tradition, tho
<div n="lb">perhaps this tradition may be erroneous. Contrariwise,
<div n="lb">there is even in Pali tradition some confusion between
<div n="lb">abbhugg- and accugg- in this group; see CPD s.v. abbhug-
<div n="lb">gata (a var. accuggata occurs with subject yaso).
