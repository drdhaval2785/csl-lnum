{@muṣṭi@}¦, f. (used in Skt. of the {%handle%} or {%grasping-%}
<div n="lb">{%point%} of a weapon), {@(1) = muṣṭi-bandha@}, q.v., {%grip%}, a
<div n="lb">manner of {%grasping%} (the bow): (bhagavatā, or maye,
<div n="lb">mayā, spoken by the Buddha) cirapraṇaṣṭā Śāk(i)ya-
<div n="lb">muṣṭi jñātā Mv ii.77.2, 3; 82.2, {%the long-lost%} (bow-){%grip of%}
<div n="lb">{%the Śākyas was known%}; referring to the young Bodhi-
<div n="lb">sattva's exploit of wielding the bow of his grandfather
<div n="lb">Siṃhahanu, which no one else could wield; ({@2@}) see s.v.
<div n="lb">{@ācārya-muṣṭi; (3)@} since {@rikta-muṣṭi@}, q.v., is used in
<div n="lb">lists of things empty and delusive, the word muṣṭi alone
<div n="lb">is, acc. to text Śikṣ 261.8, used in the same sense: evaṃ
<div n="lb">cakṣuś cendriyaṃ ca rikte (app. dual) muṣṭisadṛśam (but
<div n="lb">read rikta-muṣṭi-sadṛśam?) alīkam asadbhūtaṃ etc.; note
<div n="lb">that after rikte the epithets are (at least mostly; but see
<div n="lb">{@moṣadharma@}) singular, which makes the dual rikte
<div n="lb">suspicious, despite the double subject; and the standard
<div n="lb">use of {@riktamuṣṭi@}, occurring actually in the preceding
<div n="lb">line of Śikṣ, makes the em. seem called for.
