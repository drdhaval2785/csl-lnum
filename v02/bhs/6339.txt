{@cetaḥparyāya@}¦, m., {%way of thought, manner of mind%};
<div n="lb">less often citta-pa°; commonly preceded by para- or
<div n="lb">parasya, {%of others%}; knowledge of {%other's mental make-up%}
<div n="lb">is one of the {@abhijñā@}, q.v.; so also in Pali, where Buddha
<div n="lb">is parassa (para-) ceto-(citta-)-pariyāya-kusala (-kovida),
<div n="lb">as one of the abhiññā. In Bhīk 27a.5 cetaḥparyāyasya is
<div n="lb">not preceded by para- or equivalent, but the meaning is
<div n="lb">certainly the same, since other abhijñā precede and follow
<div n="lb">it (divyasya śrotrasya, pūrvanivāsasya). In Mv iii.321.13
<div n="lb">Buddhas are called cetaḥparyāyasaṃpannāḥ, probably
<div n="lb">also with implication of para-, tho here most of the other
<div n="lb">abhijñā are not listed; but the next following epithet is
<div n="lb">ṛddhiprātihāryasaṃpannā(ḥ), which recalls one of them.
