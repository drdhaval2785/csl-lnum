{@biliśa@}¦ (so once in Skt. for regular baḍiśa, Suparṇ.,
<div n="lb">pw 4.226; and note Pkt. biḍisa, Sheth; Pali only baḷisa,
<div n="lb">bal°), {%fishhook%}; some form or cpd. of this word is to be
<div n="lb">read in Mv iii.259.2, for mss. bilaśa (v.l. billaśa)-tāni-
<div n="lb">kāyetsuḥ, and 260.16 (vs), same reading, except that
<div n="lb">both mss. read billa° here; evidently a verb is concealed
<div n="lb">in the end; Senart reads pāṭensuḥ, and before it bila-
<div n="lb">śatāni, which is impossible. It is possible that bilaśa-
<div n="lb">(with one ms.) is the true reading, tho it is not recorded
<div n="lb">anywhere. The phrase follows, both times, that containing
<div n="lb">{@kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@} (or {@kārṣāpaṇa°@}), q.v., while in
<div n="lb">Pali lists of tortures kahāpaṇakaṃ regularly follows balisa-
<div n="lb">maṃsikaṃ. It is certain that we must understand some
<div n="lb">torture by means of {%fishhooks%}; should we read biliśa-tāṃ,
<div n="lb">{%fishhook-condition%}, i.e. being torn with fishhooks? The
<div n="lb">preceding words are much like those quoted as occurring
<div n="lb">before {@kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@}.
