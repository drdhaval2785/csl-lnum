{@ākalpa@}¦ (m.), probably = Pali ākappa in sense of
<div n="lb">{%behavior, deportment%} (PTSD): Gv 22.20 (prose) vividhākal-
<div n="lb">peryāpathānāṃ…manuṣyāṇāṃ, {%men of various deport-%}
<div n="lb">{%ment and behavior%} (see {@īryāpatha@} 4); and 22.24 nāneryā-
<div n="lb">pathākalpavihāriṇaṃ (janakāyaṃ). (The meaning {%adorn-%}
<div n="lb">{%ment%} attributed to this word in Skt surely does not fit.)
