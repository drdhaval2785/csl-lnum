{@kiṃcana@}¦ (= Pali id.), prob. {%attachment, defilement%}
<div n="lb">(see Childers and PTSD): RP 35.12 kleśābhibhūtāḥ sa-
<div n="lb">khilāḥ sa-kiṃcanāḥ (Bhvr.). Undoubtedly sa-ki° and the
<div n="lb">noun kiṃcana (in Pali) were abstracted from a-kiṃcana,
<div n="lb">adj., orig. {%having nothing%}, then {%disinterested, unattached,%}
<div n="lb">{%without attachment%} or {%defilement%}, whence finally (sa-)kiṃ-
<div n="lb">cana, as above. In late Skt. (Schmidt, Nachtr.) sa-kiṃcana
<div n="lb">occurs, glossed sa-dhana. In RP it could possibly mean
<div n="lb">{%propertied, interested in wealth%}, but Pali usage is prob.
<div n="lb">to be followed.
