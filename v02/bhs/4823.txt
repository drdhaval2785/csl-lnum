{@Kāśyapa@}¦ (= Pali Kassapa; Tib. ḥod sruṅs, {%light-%}
<div n="lb">{%guard%}, e.g. on Mvy 93), ({@1@}) n. of a former Buddha, the one
<div n="lb">immediately preceding Śākyamuni: often mentioned as
<div n="lb">having predicted the latter, and esp. as one of a group
<div n="lb">of three, the others being {@Krakucchanda@} and {@Kanaka-@}
<div n="lb">{@muni@}, or equivalents; see the former for list of such re-
<div n="lb">ferences; also alone (it being not always certain that this
<div n="lb">particular Buddha is meant, cf. Mv i.58.8, ref. to 90,000
<div n="lb">Buddhas of this name), Mv i.307.4 ff.; 312.2; 318.7 ff.;
[Page182-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">iii.249.8; Divy 22.4 ff.; 54.12, 25; 76.26 ff.; 192.25 ff.;
<div n="lb">233.21 ff.; 336.21; 337.17; 344.4 ff.; 347.1 ff.; 465.25 ff.;
<div n="lb">504.26; Av i.237.11; 247.15, et alibi; Karmav 159.7; LV
<div n="lb">172.9; 260.10; Mmk 104.17 ff.; ({@2@}) n. of one of Buddha's
<div n="lb">leading disciples, also called {@Mahā-k°@} (= Pali Kassapa
<div n="lb">or Mahā-k°), q.v.; there is no doubt that the same person
<div n="lb">is, as a rule at least, meant by the two forms, notably
<div n="lb">Kā° in Mvy 1031; Mv iii.48.2; SP 116.4; 121.3 ff.; 144.2 ff.;
<div n="lb">206.8 ff.; Divy 83.10 ff.; 396.1; K. is given the title
<div n="lb">dhutaguṇāgrapāraga Mv i.64.14 (ff.), where he is involved
<div n="lb">as an interlocutor at the First Council, perhaps its pre-
<div n="lb">siding officer (as in Pali, DPPN); he then and there causes
<div n="lb">Kātyāyana to discourse on the 10 bhūmi; similarly Divy
<div n="lb">61.28 calls him dhūtaguṇa-vādinām agro, and cf. Pali AN
<div n="lb">i.23.19 where Mahākassapa is dhutavādānaṃ (v.l. dhū-
<div n="lb">taṅgadharānaṃ) agga; mentioned in Candropama Sūtra,
<div n="lb">Hoernle MR 40 ff., = Pali SN ii.197 ff. where (Mahā)
<div n="lb">Kassapa corresponds; among mahāśrāvakas, Divy 182.22;
<div n="lb">268.6; in Divy 573.8 it appears, strangely, that ārya-
<div n="lb">kāśyapasya is an epithet of (the next word) Kātyāyanasya
<div n="lb">(pañcaśataparivārasya; in the story which follows only
<div n="lb">Mahākātyāyana appears!); it is not clear whether the same
<div n="lb">person is meant by āyuṣmān daśabalaḥ Kāśyapaḥ Divy
<div n="lb">275.5, and 7 daśabala-Kāś°;* no monk of this title is re-
<div n="lb">corded in Pali; in Vv. comm. 148.24 Kassapassa dasaba-
<div n="lb">lassa kāle refers to the Buddha Kāś°, tho I find no evidence
<div n="lb">to support PTSD and DPPN in stating that dasabala
<div n="lb">was ‘especially’ an epithet of his, ‘to distinguish him from
<div n="lb">other Kassapas’ as DPPN says; dasabala (BHS daśa°) of
<div n="lb">course usually refers to a Buddha, and in Pali generally
<div n="lb">to the B. Gotama; there are at least four other disciples
<div n="lb">of his having this name, see {@Uruvilvā-k°, Kumāra-k°,@}
<div n="lb">{@Gayā-k°, Nadī-k°; (3)@} n. of an ascetic (ṛṣi) who once
<div n="lb">lived in the Himālaya: Mv ii.106.16, a previous birth of
<div n="lb">{@Mahākāśyapa@}, q.v., 114.12; ({@4@}) n. of another (?) ascetic
<div n="lb">(ṛṣi) who lived in the hermitage {@sāhaṃjanī@} (q.v.; this
<div n="lb">is not mentioned in connection with the prec. Kā°, and the
<div n="lb">stories told of them are different): Mv iii.143.13 ff. (in
<div n="lb">story of Ekaśṛṅga and Nalinī; = Pali Kassapa 9 in DPPN);
<div n="lb">prob. the same (at least also living in Sāhaṃjanī) Mv
<div n="lb">iii.362.14; 363.19. See also {@Pūraṇa Kāśyapa; Jaṅghā-k°;@}
<div n="lb">{@Vṛddha-k°@}.--*Correction in proof: MPS 49.16 names
<div n="lb">four mahāsthavirāḥ in the world (pṛthivyāṃ) at the time
<div n="lb">of Buddha's death; two of them were Daśabala-Kāśyapa
<div n="lb">(one word) and Mahā-Kāśyapa. This settles the above
<div n="lb">question; D.K. is a separate person.
