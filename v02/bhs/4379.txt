{@katara@}¦, pron. adj. (see also {@katira@}; cf. {@anyatara@};
<div n="lb">used in this way sometimes in Pali and apparently even
<div n="lb">in Skt., where however the cases are rare and not always
<div n="lb">certain), {%which%} (of more than two)?: Divy 102.17; 308.8;
<div n="lb">371.23 kataraḥ (of several) kumāro…rājā bhaviṣyati;
<div n="lb">Śikṣ 75.4; KP 97.4 kataraṃ (cited Śikṣ 233.15 as katarat)
<div n="lb">cittaṃ; MSV iii.136.10 (read kataraṃ tat), 12. In LV
<div n="lb">239.15 (Ārāḍasya dharmo…) na niryāti tat-katarasya
<div n="lb">samyagduḥkhakṣayāya, and Mv ii.119.5 (nāyaṃ) Ārāḍasya
<div n="lb">dharmo niryāti tat-katarasya (so mss.) samyagduḥkha-
<div n="lb">kṣayāye, could at best (but implausibly) be taken to mean
<div n="lb">{%A.'s religion does not result in the complete destruction of%}
<div n="lb">{%the misery of anyone%}. But Senart emended to tat-karasya,
<div n="lb">{%of (for) the one who performs it%} (sc. Ā.'s religion), which
<div n="lb">is confirmed by Tib. on LV de byed pa, {%one who has done%}
<div n="lb">{%that%}. It is indeed strange to find the same corruption in
<div n="lb">both texts; but the em. seems quite certain; it is con-
<div n="lb">firmed by Pali takkarassa DN i.235.17; MN i.68.12, in
<div n="lb">a quite similar phrase; and in a close parallel Mv ii.120.16
<div n="lb">one ms. reads tatkarasya (the other corruptly taktenasya).
