<div n="lb">specially AN comm. ii.234.25 ff. on AN i.144.2 (cited
<div n="lb">PTSD °hārika-, but actually °hāriya-) in contrast with
<div n="lb">Vv. comm. 71.26 ff. on Vv. 15 vs 6 (same stanza as in AN,
<div n="lb">wholly discordant glosses in comms.; at least one of them
<div n="lb">clearly a baseless guess). Evidently the tradition of the
<div n="lb">true mg. was lost at an early time. In BHS noted only
<div n="lb">in Mmk, where it is fairly common, but I have found no
<div n="lb">evidence as to mg., except that pakṣa has its usual mg.
