<div n="lb">in {@maṇḍala-māḍa, °māla@}, q.v. Perhaps this same word
<div n="lb">is to be recognized in the Bhvr. cpd. candana-māla,
<div n="lb">{%having halls of sandalwood%}, ep. of prāsāda, {%palace%}, in Divy
<div n="lb">43.1, 7; 49.27 ff., and of a vihāra in Karmav 64.1. But
<div n="lb">Lévi in his note ad loc. identifies ({@3@}) -māla here with
<div n="lb">{@mālā@}, q.v., and supports his theory with the cpd. {@mālā-@}
<div n="lb">{@vihāra@}, q.v.; he may be right (in that case, {%having tops%}
<div n="lb">or {%crowning pavilions of sandālwood%}); the matter seems
<div n="lb">to me doubtful.
