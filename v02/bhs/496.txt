{@adhyāvara@}¦, m. (= Pali ajjhāvara), {%associate, atten-%}
<div n="lb">{%dant, member of retinue%}: adhyāvarā (acc. pl.; so all mss.,
<div n="lb">Lefm. em. °carā) kṛtvana sarvadevān LV 395.9 (vs),
<div n="lb">{%having made all gods my associates%}. CPD and PTSD suggest
<div n="lb">emending the Pali form, also, to ajjhācara. But the two
<div n="lb">forms confirm each other and must surely be kept, what-
<div n="lb">ever the etymology of this rare and obscure word may be.
