{@saṃpratigrāhin@}¦, adj. or n. ag. (to Skt. saṃ-prati-
<div n="lb">grah- with -in; cf. prec.), {%accepting, one who accepts%}: taṃ
<div n="lb">nūnam agrasattvo hy agrāhuti-°hī LV 316.8 (vs), prob.
<div n="lb">{%therefore surely the Supreme Being is accepting the supreme%}
<div n="lb">{%offering%}. So Lefm. implies, by printing °huti-saṃ° as one
<div n="lb">word. In JAOS 57.22 I took the form as an aor. of °grāha-
<div n="lb">yati (which is not recorded), in the mg. of °gṛhṇāti; this
<div n="lb">still seems to me possible, but I now prefer the inter-
<div n="lb">pretation given above.
