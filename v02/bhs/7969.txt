{@? dhaura@}¦ = (or error for?) Skt. dhaureya, in (puruṣa-
<div n="lb">siṃhena puruṣarṣabheṇa) puruṣa-dhaureṇa (puruṣajāne-
<div n="lb">yena, see {@-jāneya@}) Mv ii.133.8 (prose); in essentially the
<div n="lb">same passage in which other texts read puruṣa-dhaureyeṇa,
<div n="lb">but in Mv with v.l. °dhaureṇa, LV 350.12; Mv i.229.8;
<div n="lb">ii.284.18. The word dhaureya, = Pali dhoreyya and
<div n="lb">(purisa-)dhorayha, occurs occasionally in Skt., and seems
<div n="lb">to mean primarily {%stout animal, capable of bearing burdens%},
<div n="lb">but then secondarily {%best of his kind%} (= mukhya, Schmidt,
<div n="lb">Nachträge). In the cliché passage just mentioned, it refers
<div n="lb">to superior men, esp. Buddhas (used in reference to Śākya-
<div n="lb">muni at the moment of enlightenment). In…dhīrā dhau-
<div n="lb">reyā dhṛtimanto…, in the midst of a long description
<div n="lb">of the inhabitants of Sukhāvatī, Sukh 61.6 (prose); in
<div n="lb">Mv ii.364.16 (vs), of a man who worships at stūpas,
<div n="lb">dṛḍhavīryo dṛḍhasthāmo dhaureyo (replaced by vīraś ca
<div n="lb">in citation Śikṣ 299.3) dṛḍhavikramo. In all these it is not
<div n="lb">entirely clear how definite the lit. mg., {%stout animal%},
<div n="lb">remained. In any case (puruṣa-)dhaureya seems pretty
<div n="lb">well established as standard Skt.; and I suspect that
<div n="lb">dhaura is a mere error.
