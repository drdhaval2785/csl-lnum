<L>10808<pc>396,1<k1>Palaha<k2>Palaha-
{@phalaha-@}¦, also written {@°kha, °ka@}, in comp. with
<div n="lb">stāra (cf. AMg. phalaha, defined as {%a big plank%}, Ratnach.,
<div n="lb">and identified with Skt. phalaka), some part of a gate or
<div n="lb">door: Mv i.195.13; iii.228.10 (prose; same passage; follow-
<div n="lb">ing the sentence containing {@phalikha-@} (q.v.)-phalakāni;
<div n="lb">in i.195.13 mss. phalaha-stārā(ḥ), Senart em. phalaka-; in
<div n="lb">iii.228.10 he reads phalaka° without v.l., but acc. to his
<div n="lb">note i p. 530, on the other passage, one ms. at least reads
<div n="lb">phalakha-stārā(ḥ); it seems reasonably clear that the AMg.
<div n="lb">form, conceivably with °kha for °ha, was read in Mv.
<div n="lb">(Cf. {@phalikāstaraṇa?@} but I cannot mediate between
<div n="lb">these two forms, both enigmatic.)
