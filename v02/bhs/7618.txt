{@dvāra-koṣṭhaka@}¦, m. (= Pali °koṭṭhaka; cf. {@caraṇa-@}
<div n="lb">{@koṣṭha@}), lit. {%gate-room%}; a room, or (often) roofed but open
<div n="lb">space, over a gate or entrance (to a private house, religious
[Page274-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">edifice, or city); such spaces, guarded by railings and
<div n="lb">covered but open in front, are seen in the ‘cave-temples’
<div n="lb">of Ajanta etc. Also, perhaps by extension, seems to be
<div n="lb">used in the sense of {%gate, entrance%}; and sometimes it is hard
<div n="lb">to say which is meant: °ke sthitvā Divy 17.12, {%at the gate%}
<div n="lb">(entrance, to a house); bhagavāṃs tasya (sc. of a private
<div n="lb">person, at his house) dvārakoṣṭhakam anuprāptaḥ; dauvā-
<div n="lb">rikapuruṣeṇāsya niveditaṃ, bhagavān dvāre (note! =

<div n="lb">gataḥ…dvāra°ke sthitvāgaruṃ dhūpitavān Av i.24.2;
<div n="lb">in the last it is hard to say whether the gateway, or the
<div n="lb">space over it, is meant; app. of the space over the entrance
<div n="lb">to a vihāra, °ke pañcagaṇḍakaṃ cakraṃ kārayitavyam
