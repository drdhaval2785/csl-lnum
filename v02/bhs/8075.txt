{@namati@}¦, in LV 259.21 (vs) said by Foucaux to mean
<div n="lb">{%arise, get up%}, and vinamate, {%sit down%}. But I think the mgs.
<div n="lb">of both are close to or identical with those of normal
<div n="lb">Skt. Line 20 reads, na ca iñjate bhramati vā dhyāyaty
<div n="lb">āsphānakaṃ dhyānaṃ, {%and he does not stir nor swerve,%}
<div n="lb">{%he practises the āsph° dhyāna%}; then 21, na ca namati no
<div n="lb">vinamate na kāyaparirakṣaṇā spṛśati, {%and he does not bend%}
<div n="lb">(to one side?) {%nor stoop down…%} On the other hand,
<div n="lb">namati is used as in Pali (apparently not in Skt. so far
<div n="lb">as recorded) with object cittaṃ, {%bends, inclines the mind,%}
<div n="lb">{%thought%}, with loc. (dat.), {%towards…%}; see {@nāmayati@}, also
<div n="lb">used similarly: pravrajyāyai (so Senart, but °ye, which
<div n="lb">might be loc., is just as plausible; mss. °āryeś, °āyaiś)
<div n="lb">cittaṃ name (aor.) Mv i.322.20; ppp., pāṃśukūle cittaṃ
<div n="lb">nataṃ LV 266.3.
