{@akṣudrāvakāśa@}¦ (= Pali akkhuddāvakāsa), {%of fine%}
<div n="lb">{%(not inferior) appearance%}. Almost always follows prāsādika
<div n="lb">and darśanīya; all virtual synonyms, applied to women
<div n="lb">and less often to men and children: Mv i.196.20; 352.15;
<div n="lb">ii.422.1, 7 (boy); 432.14; iii.35.18 (man); 153.16 (here
<div n="lb">prāsādika is lacking); 218.11; 377.12; 404.17 (an infant
<div n="lb">boy). In Mv i.197.16 (not accompanied by the other adj.)
<div n="lb">said of the family (kulam) in which a Bodhisattva is
<div n="lb">born; but perhaps this is an erroneous reading, or if cor-
<div n="lb">rect means rather {%possessing no small scope, range, sphere%}
<div n="lb">{%of activity or opportunity%} (with the meaning of {@avakāśa@}
<div n="lb">normal in Skt., Pali, and BHS). This latter, at least, is
<div n="lb">clearly meant by Mv ii.1.7, a parallel passage, which
<div n="lb">reads akṣudrāvacaraṃ instead of this. A third parallel,
<div n="lb">LV 23.12, reads akṣudrānupaghāti, which surely means
<div n="lb">{%not petty and not injurious%} (so Tib., phran tshegs med ciṅ
<div n="lb">gnod par byed pa med pa yin), not {%ne frappe pas ceux%}
<div n="lb">{%qui ne sont pas méchants%} (Foucaux).
