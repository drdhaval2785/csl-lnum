{@? siṃhāsapīṭha@}¦ (°supīṭha ?), adj., only in first half
<div n="lb">of an anuṣṭubh vs, °pīṭho (or °pīṭhā) balavān: Mv ii.431.17
<div n="lb">(here printed as prose, wrongly); 458.10; iii.7.2, 13; 13.9;
<div n="lb">so mss., with practically no variants except °sa° or °su°,
<div n="lb">°ṭhā or °ṭho; Senart has various emendations and suggested
<div n="lb">interpretations, doubting at last (iii n. 466) his suggestion
<div n="lb">of ii n. 568, -sapīṭha = sadṛśa, {%(lion-)like%}; except that the
<div n="lb">mg. must be in effect {%strong%}, or the like, I cannot interpret
<div n="lb">the word. It may be cpd. with the foll. balavān, and is
<div n="lb">doubtless corrupt. (Divide siṃhāsa-[= siṃhāsana-]-pīṭho?)
