{@śvasā@}¦, n. sg., {%mother-in-law%}: Mvy 3894 = Tib.
<div n="lb">sgyug mo. Evidently for Skt. śvaśrū with ending modified
<div n="lb">by that of svasā (svasṛ), {%sister%}; MIndic forms of the two
<div n="lb">words resemble each other more closely, cf. Pkt. sussū
<div n="lb">with susā, {%sister%}. Mironov reads svasā in Mvy; but the
<div n="lb">mg. is certainly {%mother-in-law%}, as shown not only by Tib.
<div n="lb">but by the position of the word, after śvaśura.
