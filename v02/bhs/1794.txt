{@amātya-prekṣita@}¦, Mv ii.1.9 (mss.), or {@amātyā-@}
<div n="lb">{@vekṣita@}, LV 23.20, {%watched (guarded) by ministers%}, nt.
<div n="lb">adj., epithet of the family in which the Bodhisattva is
<div n="lb">to be born; to be taken closely with foll. phrase, Mv
<div n="lb">taṃ kulaṃ bhogāṃ bhuṃjati, LV tat kulaṃ bhavati
<div n="lb">bhogān paribhunakti, {%it eats its meals%} (or, {%enjoys its wealth%})
<div n="lb">{%under the guardianship of ministers%}; so Tib. blon pos blta
<div n="lb">zhiṅ loṅs spyod la spyod pa yin. In Mv the mss. have
<div n="lb">°preṣitaṃ, which Senart emends rightly; but he also,
<div n="lb">wrongly, em. amānya for amātya. The parallel Mv i.197.19
<div n="lb">is different and doubtless corrupt.
