{@pārami-, °mī@}¦ (f.; = Pali id., in Pali used both as
<div n="lb">in BHS, pāramippatta, °miṃ-gata, Childers, and, usually
<div n="lb">in the form pāramī, as equivalent of BHS {@pāramitā@} 2;
<div n="lb">BHS seems to use it only once in this latter sense; seems
[Page341-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">clearly deriv. in secondary -a, fem. -ī, from parama),
<div n="lb">{%mastery, supremacy%}; usually in vss; in LV 414.19 (vs)
<div n="lb">read ṣaḍi pārami te, {%the six supremacies%} (= {@pāramitā@} 2)
<div n="lb">{%are thine%} (see § 19.24); otherwise noted by me only in
<div n="lb">forms °mi-, °mī-, and (with -gata) most commonly °miṃ-,
<div n="lb">in comp. with following -gata or -prāpta (edd. often print
<div n="lb">the cpd. as two words), {%arrived at, attained to mastery%},
<div n="lb">often in comp. with preceding word stating the field of
<div n="lb">mastery, but also used absolutely, aham atra °mī-prāpto

<div n="lb">ca); 398.19 (vs, āryadharmeṣv iha); Divy 637.5 (vs,

<div n="lb">°mi-gata RP 13.11 (vs, dhyāne vīryaguṇe ca); in the
