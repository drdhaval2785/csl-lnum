<div n="lb">once, see CPD which suggests em. to adhi°), {%excels, sur-%}
<div n="lb">{%passes%}: Mv ii.307.6, mss. abhigṛhṇanti (buddhā, raśmi-
<div n="lb">bhiḥ), Senart em. ati° (but ati-grah- in this sense is rare
<div n="lb">and doubtful in Skt. and does not occur in Pali); in next
<div n="lb">line 7 Senart reads atigṛhyate with one ms., the other
<div n="lb">reads abhigṛhniṣu; a pass. seems required but perhaps
<div n="lb">abhigṛhyate is to be read.
