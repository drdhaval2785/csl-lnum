{@purima-kāraka@}¦, m., °kā(ḥ) n. pl., some sort of
<div n="lb">artisan or tradesman, in a list of occupations: Mv iii.113.14;
<div n="lb">443.1 (so without v.l. both times, except one ms. in 443.1
<div n="lb">°kārā). What {%makers of purima%} means is not clear, but
<div n="lb">this word can hardly be identified with the adj. {@purima@}.
[Page348-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">It is prob. connected with AMg. purima as cited by Sheth
<div n="lb">(as a Deśī word) from Ohaṇijjutti 265 (I have not found
<div n="lb">it in Ratnach.) cha ppurimā nava khoḍā; the word khoḍa =
<div n="lb">{%cleansing%} a part of a garment (see Ratnach. s.v.), and
<div n="lb">Sheth says purima, like khoḍa, is a part of the Jain
<div n="lb">cleansing ceremony, (prasphoṭana or) pratilekhana. If
<div n="lb">{%cleaning%} is the mg., our cpd. would perhaps mean {%pro-%}
<div n="lb">{%fessional cleaners%} (of clothes). I have no access to the
<div n="lb">Ohaṇijjutti.
