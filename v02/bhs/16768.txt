{@sāhasra-cūḍika@}¦, m. (cf. Pali sahassī cūḷanikā loka-
<div n="lb">dhātu), n. of a lokadhātu: Mvy 3042. Cf. repeatedly in
<div n="lb">AsP sāhasre cūḍike (or, cūḍikāyāṃ) lokadhātau, loc., the
<div n="lb">cpd. apparently divided into two words, sāhasre, always
<div n="lb">m., but cūḍikāyāṃ, f., in AsP 65.3; 66.2, and so v.l., one
<div n="lb">ms. out of six, 105.13, 16; 108.3, 5; but cūḍike text with
<div n="lb">5 mss. in these four places, and elsewhere, e.g. 117.18,
<div n="lb">without v.l.; no reading with cūḍikāyāṃ has been noted
<div n="lb">except in the passages cited; (sahasrika)ś cyūḍiko (read
<div n="lb">cū°) lokadhātuḥ MPS 31.46. The form cūḍ° evidently
<div n="lb">means {%small, minor%}, and is related to Pali cūḷa, culla.
<div n="lb">Contrasted with {@dvisāhasra…@} and {@trisāhasramahā-@}
<div n="lb">{@sāhasra…@}, qq.v. In ŚsP 26.8 and elsewhere replaced by
<div n="lb">sāhasre lokadhātau, see {@sāhasra@}.
