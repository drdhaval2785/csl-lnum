{@Ārāḍa@}¦ (also {@Arāḍa@}, q.v., and see next; = Pali
<div n="lb">Āḷāra), n. of a sage under whom Śākyamuni studied for
<div n="lb">a time; in a dvandva cpd. Ārāḍodraka (-Udraka) Divy
<div n="lb">392.1 (see also under {@Arāḍa@} and {@Ārāḍaka@}); generally
<div n="lb">surnamed Kālāma (= Pali id.): °ḍa-Kāl° as one word
<div n="lb">Mvy 3515, but regularly two words: Mv ii.118.1 ff.;
<div n="lb">198.1; iii.322.15, 17; in LV 238.14, 19 f.; 239.6, 12; 403.20;
<div n="lb">404.2--3, 3--4, Lefmann reads the surname always Kālāpa;
<div n="lb">the mss. generally vary, in 404.3 all have Kālāma. How-
<div n="lb">ever, there seems to have been some support in northern
<div n="lb">tradition for the ending -pa, for Tib. on Mvy and LV
<div n="lb">renders sgyu rtsal śes (byed), {%knowing arts%}, which seems
<div n="lb">to point to analysis into kalā plus a form of root āp-.
