{@abhitunna@}¦, and {@abhitūrṇa@} (= Pali abhitunna, also
<div n="lb">written °ṇṇa; etym., see below), {%afflicted%}: Mv i.156.10 (vs)
<div n="lb">tasya…vacābhitunno…rudanto (subject Chandaka:
<div n="lb">{%afflicted by his words%}); iii.284.13 śokābhitunna (so Pali
<div n="lb">sokābhi°). The form abhitūrṇa is read by KN in SP 320.9
<div n="lb">duḥkhābhir vedanābhir abhi°, with Kashgar rec.; in 321.3
<div n="lb">Kashgar rec. also vedanābhitūrṇān, but KN this time
<div n="lb">°bhibhūtān. Kern cites Pāṇ. 6.4.21 for tūrṇa (not recorded
<div n="lb">in literature) as ppp. of turvati, {%overcomes%}. Neither this
<div n="lb">root nor tud is recorded with abhi, except for the Pali
<div n="lb">form cited, which CPD derives from tud, but Kern (see
<div n="lb">PTSD) from turv, doubtless because of BHS abhitūrṇa.
<div n="lb">The BHS °tunna could be a MIndicism; but contrariwise,
<div n="lb">perhaps, °tūrṇa could be an unhistoric hyper-Sktism. All
<div n="lb">that seems certain is that the two belong together and with
<div n="lb">Pali abhitunna.
