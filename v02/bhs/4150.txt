<div n="lb">prose of LV, 13.22 and 307.13 (so all Lefm.'s mss. and
<div n="lb">Weller's ms., certainly not misprint as suggested by Weller
<div n="lb">16), as well as 441.12, eṣām evarūpāṇāṃ dharmāṇāṃ
<div n="lb">(no v.l. except Calc. evaṃrū°, cited by Lefm., so that
<div n="lb">evarū° is not a misprint; not noted by Weller). Pali also
<div n="lb">uses evarūpa in prose as well as verse. (PTSD cites this
<div n="lb">cpd. under eva; of course it should be under evaṃ.) Cf.
<div n="lb">{@keva-rūpa@}.
