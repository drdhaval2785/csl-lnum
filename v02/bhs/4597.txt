{@kalpam@}¦, adv. (from {@kalpa@}, q.v.; = Pali kappaṃ),
<div n="lb">lit. and orig. {%for a kalpa, = for a long time%}: SP 227.5 (prose)
<div n="lb">(yaḥ…tathāgatasya) saṃmukhaṃ kalpam avarṇaṃ
<div n="lb">bhāṣet, {%who should for a long time speak ill before%} (= to-
<div n="lb">wards) {%a T%}. (The translators misunderstand.) The verse
<div n="lb">account has (229.7) yaś caiva…jinasya saṃmukhaṃ
<div n="lb">śrāved avarṇaṃ paripūrṇakalpam,…{%for a full kalpa%},
<div n="lb">which may therefore be the mg. of 227.5; but the Pali
<div n="lb">adv. is well established.
