<div n="lb">bhāga-vimutta), {%emancipated from both parts%}: Mvy 1028
<div n="lb">(misprinted °bhaga°; corr. Index); Divy 404.24 (read:
<div n="lb">ubhau hi tau ubhayatobhāgavimuktau); Bhīk 27b.1; cf.
<div n="lb">AbhidhK. LaV-P. ii.205; vi.275--7. Often edd. (Pali and
<div n="lb">BHS) print ubha(ya)to as separate word, wrongly; it
