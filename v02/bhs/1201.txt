{@anyatra@}¦, adv., ({@1@}) {%on the contrary%} (this mg. seems
<div n="lb">exclusively peculiar to BHS); always after negative ex-
<div n="lb">pressions: SP 73.10 anyatra tena tenaiva dhāvanti, (they

<div n="lb">(wrongly Régamey); Śikṣ 147.3 (and several times in
<div n="lb">Śikṣ followed by {@yāvad eva@}, {%just simply%}, q.v.); the negative
<div n="lb">may be repeated just before anyatra, but only as resuming
<div n="lb">the neg. of the preceding clause, not negating the clause
<div n="lb">containing anyatra: Bbh 121. (19-)21 (a Bodhisattva does
<div n="lb">not give a petitioner the trouble of asking repeatedly
<div n="lb">before he gives him a gift;) nānyatra yācitamātra eva,
<div n="lb">{%no; on the contrary%}, (he gives) {%the very moment he is asked%};
<div n="lb">({@2@}) {%except%}; in Skt. and Pali hardly used except as pre-
<div n="lb">position (with abl. in Skt., Pali aññatra also with instr.
<div n="lb">and gen.); in Skt. very rarely as adverb, the noun being
<div n="lb">construed with other words in the sentence (see BR 1.266
<div n="lb">and pw 3.251). In BHS I have noted a single case, not
<div n="lb">wholly certain, of anyatra as preposition with instr. (as
<div n="lb">in Pali, instead of abl. as in Skt.): RP 40.4 rātriṃdivaṃ
<div n="lb">bhavantībhir nānyā kathā kāryā, anyatra nṛttagītavād-
<div n="lb">itena, {%you are to say nothing else, except dance, song, and%}
<div n="lb">{%instrumental music%} (?). But the adverbial use in this mg.,
<div n="lb">so rare in Skt. and not recorded for Pali, is well established
<div n="lb">in BHS; in the following cases the form and construction
<div n="lb">of other words in the clause is totally unaffected by
<div n="lb">anyatra; often it may be translated as if it were a con-
<div n="lb">junction, {%except that…%} It almost always follows a negative
<div n="lb">expression (or interrogative, rhetorically equivalent to
<div n="lb">neg.); and this is sometimes resumed by an additional
<div n="lb">na before anyatra (as in the last case under 1, above):
<div n="lb">Divy 6.28 sārthaṃ na paśyati nānyatra gardabhayānam
<div n="lb">eva, {%he didn't see the caravan, not except only a donkey-%}
<div n="lb">{%cart%}; and with anyatra as quasi-conjunction, Mv ii.90.14-15

<div n="lb">{%there is no other means, not%} (any) {%except%} (that) {%I bale out%}
