<div n="lb">The prec. and foll. items show that, acc. to persistent
<div n="lb">tradition, LV (and esp. in this vicinity) uses forms in
<div n="lb">śiṣy- for Skt. and usual BHS śikṣ-; those which Weller
<div n="lb">notices he regards as mere corruptions for śikṣ- (41, line 1);
<div n="lb">but it is not impossible that the word śiṣya is concerned
<div n="lb">in some or all of them, even in this, which could be a
<div n="lb">denom. In śiṣyā(-pada), for śikṣā-, the influence of śiṣya
<div n="lb">could only have been exerted in secondary blending. These
<div n="lb">substitutions may also have phonetic aspects (ṣ for kh
