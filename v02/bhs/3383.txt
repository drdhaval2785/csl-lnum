{@uttarika@}¦ (Pali, see below), in Śikṣ 332.1 (vs) ăjīvika-
<div n="lb">dharma-carāṇāṃ uttarikāṇa anuttarikāṇāṃ, {%of Ājīvika-%}
<div n="lb">{%sectarians, superior and not superior(?)%}; acc. to Bendall
<div n="lb">and Rouse, Transl., {%those who have or those who have not%}
<div n="lb">{%the higher aim%}, which is hardly illuminating. See Bendall's
<div n="lb">note in Text p. 414 for report of a Chin. interpretation, for
<div n="lb">which I find no basis in Indic. In Pali uttarika is reported
<div n="lb">only Nett. 50.10 °kānaṃ phalānaṃ pattiyā; obviously
<div n="lb">{%superior%} or the like. Pali has no anuttarika.
