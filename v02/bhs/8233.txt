{@nigha@}¦, m. (also {@nīgha@}, q.v., and cf. {@anigha@}), {%evil, sin%}:
<div n="lb">Mvy 7308 = Tib. sdig pa, {%sin%}. In Pali only anigha, anīgha
<div n="lb">seem to be in real use; nigha and nīgha are given in comms.
<div n="lb">and said to mean dukkha; they have the look of ab-
<div n="lb">stractions from anigha (anīgha); alternatively the comms.
<div n="lb">analyze an-īgha. Real etym. of anigha uncertain. But
<div n="lb">BHS seems clearly to have used nigha, and probably
<div n="lb">nīgha, independently (tho perhaps by secondary back-
<div n="lb">formation from an°).
