2 {@cetayati@}¦ (the verb on which is based Pali caus.
<div n="lb">cetāpeti, below), {%buys%}: cetayitvā, ger., Prāt 492.13; 493.2,
<div n="lb">4, 9 etc., see {@cetanaka@}. In Lang. 22.98 it was stated
<div n="lb">that the subject of Pali cetāpeti, {%causes to be bought, has%}
<div n="lb">{%bought%}, ‘is always a monk or nun, who instigates (a layman)
<div n="lb">to buy (something for himself or herself).’ This is true
<div n="lb">only in Vin. iv.250.14--15; in Vin. iii.216.13 and 237.10
<div n="lb">the subject is a layman, tho the mg. is certainly {%causes to%}
<div n="lb">{%be bought, has bought%} (for the benefit of a monk). Vin.
<div n="lb">iii.216.13 is the same passage as Prāt 492.13 (see {@cetanaka@})
<div n="lb">where cetayitvā, {%having bought%}, replaces Pali cetāpetvā,
<div n="lb">{%having had%} (ordered) {%bought%} (for a monk). The non-caus.
<div n="lb">form of Prāt proves the meaning of the caus. Pali form,
<div n="lb">which Pali interpreters have not understood. The former
<div n="lb">is not recorded in Pali, nor the latter in BHS. The etymology
<div n="lb">is unknown but the mg. is clear from the contexts.
