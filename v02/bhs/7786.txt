{@dharma-paryāya@}¦, m. (Pali dhammapariyāya, not
<div n="lb">well defined PTSD), lit. {%device, means of%} (teaching) {%the%}
<div n="lb">{%doctrine%}, and so, secondarily, {%religious discourse%}. Cf. Pali
<div n="lb">(kathā) sapariyāyā and nippariyāyā (e.g. Vism. 473.16--17),
<div n="lb">{%discourse involving indirect- devices%} (not to be taken ab-
<div n="lb">solutely literally), {%and discourse to be taken literally, without%}
<div n="lb">{%‘devices’%}; cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. ix. 247, note. This fits the
<div n="lb">regular BHS mg. of {@paryāya@}, q.v. 2. Tib. renders chos
<div n="lb">kyi (dharma-) rnam graṅs, {%specification, enumeration%} (Das);
<div n="lb">only in this cpd. the Tib. Dictt. allege also the mg. {%treatise,%}
<div n="lb">{%dissertation%} for rnam graṅs, but obviously that is made
<div n="lb">to fit this word alone; the Tib. rendering was intended to ren-
<div n="lb">der Skt. paryāya, {%repetition, series%}, etc. (only in the Veda does
<div n="lb">it mean {%a piece of text%}, and then chiefly if not exclusively
<div n="lb">one that is {%repeated, a refrain%}, etc.; this special use cannot
<div n="lb">be related to the BHS and Pali word, tho PTSD would
<div n="lb">have it so). Originally, the mg. was close to that of {@upā-@}
<div n="lb">{@yakauśalya@}, indeed it was a verbal manifestation of that
<div n="lb">quality as clearly in: tathāgatasyaiṣa kulaputrā dharma-
<div n="lb">paryāyo (so WT with most mss., supported by Tib. chos
<div n="lb">kyi rnam graṅs te; KN deśanā-paryāyo, which would be
<div n="lb">substantially equivalent) yad evaṃ vyāharati, nāsty atra
<div n="lb">tathāgatasya mṛṣāvādaḥ SP 320.5, {%this is the Tathāgata's%}
<div n="lb">{%way of%} (teaching the) {%doctrine…%} (sc. by giving out state-
<div n="lb">ments not literally true); {%in so doing the T. does not lie%};
<div n="lb">cf. dharmāṇāṃ paryāya-jñānam Bbh 214.10 (with dhar-
<div n="lb">māṇāṃ lakṣaṇa-jñānam id.11); ayaṃ mañjuśrīḥ dharma-
<div n="lb">paryāyaḥ, asmiṃ sthāne pracariṣyati Mmk 657.3, {%this, M.,%}
<div n="lb">{%is a way of%} (teaching) {%the doctrine%} (does this refer to the

<div n="lb">a specific {%religious discourse%}: asmin khalu dharmaparyāye
