{@āvusa@}¦, and other forms based on Pali āvuso, {%brother!%}
<div n="lb">(see s.v. {@āyuṣmaṃ@}): āvusa, as if voc. to a stem of that
<div n="lb">form, is used repeatedly as an address in AdP, e.g. 13.4, 10,
<div n="lb">22, etc. In Mv i.91.6 (vs) Senart reads āvuso; meter needs
<div n="lb">¯ ˘ x; mss. āyuṣaḥ (note that no form of āyuṣmant
<div n="lb">is metrically possible), ānuṣaḥ, onuṣaḥ, ānuṣa; in SP 378.1
<div n="lb">(prose) Kashgar rec. āvusāho (for ed. āyuṣmanto), certainly
<div n="lb">to be read (voc. pl. of a stem āvusa, as in AdP, with ending
<div n="lb">āho, § 8.88); in Mv i.317.15, 16 (prose) āvusāvo seems to
<div n="lb">be found in the same sense (mss. unanimous on -vo;
<div n="lb">see § 8.89; in 16 mss. ānusāvo or anu°, but no v.l. in 15).
