{@parindāmi@}¦ (also {@parī°, anu-par°@}, qq.v.; peculiar to
<div n="lb">BHS; formation unexplained, see below), {%I present, hand%}
<div n="lb">{%over%}: °āmi SP 410.10; 484.5; LV 443.9 (Lefm. paridāmy,
<div n="lb">read with v.l. parind°); ppp. parindita, see {@Parinditārtha@},
<div n="lb">and Pargiter ap. Hoernle MR p. 179, where parindita is
<div n="lb">read for parī° Vaj 20.4, 10. Could nasalized vowel -in-
<div n="lb">(-iṃ) be a substitute by the ‘law of Morae’ for parī-dāmi
<div n="lb">(cf. ppp. parītta), and the forms with parīnd° be blends?
<div n="lb">Not satisfactory. But parī- occurs for pari-. Dr. Paul
<div n="lb">Tedesco would derive by the Morengesetz from *pariddāmi
<div n="lb">for paridadāmi with loss of -a-; as a parallel he cites Skt.
<div n="lb">ujjhāmi etc., which he also derives directly from uj-jahāmi
<div n="lb">with loss of -a-. That ujjh- is somehow derived from ud
<div n="lb">plus root hā, few will doubt; but I am not sure that this
<div n="lb">is the precise way (for a different one see Uhlenbeck s.v.);
<div n="lb">and I should like other examples of such loss of -a-.
