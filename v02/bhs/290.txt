{@atikrānta@}¦, adj. (ppp.), {%surpassing, wonderful%}, (speci-
<div n="lb">fically of appearance) {%beautiful%}: atikrāntā (so mss., Senart
<div n="lb">abhi°) ca mānuṣāḥ Mv iii.96.19; 100.20; °ta-varṇa, {%of%}
<div n="lb">{%beautiful appearance%}, LV 396.17; Mv iii.316.13; 317.11;
<div n="lb">also Mv ii.257.9; 258.7; iii.197.15; 302.10 (in these four
<div n="lb">Senart em. abhikrānta°). The equivalent Pali is regularly
<div n="lb">abhikkanta (-vaṇṇa), but atikkanta also occurs in the
<div n="lb">same sense (CPD s.v.). In BHS, in this sense, abhikrānta
<div n="lb">occurs, if at all, only in LV 398.11 °ta varṇa, see {@abhi-@}
<div n="lb">{@krānta@} 2. Since t and bh are easily confused, it may be
<div n="lb">that graphic confusion is here concerned. On the other
<div n="lb">hand, atikrānta is erroneously read, e.g. in Divy 462.13,
<div n="lb">for {@abhikrānta@} (1), which is correctly read in the same
<div n="lb">passage in MSV i.70.3, and elsewhere in that text.
