<div n="lb">°tam (so or °tam mss.; Senart em. gaditaṃ, but his note
<div n="lb">retracts the em.) āviṣṭaṃ bhāṣati, metr. dubious; i.171.11
<div n="lb">galita-pada-saṃcayavatī, of Buddha's voice. It would
<div n="lb">perhaps be rash to read agalita, which is used in Pali
<div n="lb">in the sense of {%(not dropping,) fluent, distinct, agreeable%}
