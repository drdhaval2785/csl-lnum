<div n="lb">(sarvaratna)-paṅktirucirasūkṣma-kusuma-reṇu-pramukta-
<div n="lb">kān Gv 100.12 (prose); so text, but there is something wrong
<div n="lb">with it; it occurs in a long series of acc. nt. or m. epithets,
<div n="lb">mostly ending -aṃ, applied to a park (udyānaṃ, line 11).
<div n="lb">The following word begins with s-, so the form could
<div n="lb">only be acc. pl. m., which makes no sense. It would be
<div n="lb">unsatisfactory to em. to °kaṃ; I have no suggestion.
