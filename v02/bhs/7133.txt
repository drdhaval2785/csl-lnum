{@triḥsahasrā@}¦ (only f.) = {@trisahasrā@}, see {@°ra@}; like the
<div n="lb">latter only in vss, and °sah° presumably m.c. for °sāh°;
<div n="lb">printed in LV 368.7 (°rā), 11 (°rā) and 21 (°rāṃ, here with
<div n="lb">medinī = °nīṃ); all mss. in 7 and 21, and all but one
<div n="lb">(A, the best) in 11, read tri-sah°, unmetr., Lefm. em. m.c.;
<div n="lb">trī° would be equally satisfactory but A triḥ° in 11;
<div n="lb">triḥs- can be interpreted as doubling of the sibilant m.c.,
<div n="lb">but doubtless influence of tris, {%thrice%}, is involved. No
<div n="lb">noun accompanies the (substantivized) adj. in 7, 11.
