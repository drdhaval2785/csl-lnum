{@deva@}¦ (Skt.), often also {@devaputra@} (rare in Skt., com-
<div n="lb">mon in Pali devaputta), {%god%}. More or less complete and
<div n="lb">corresponding lists of the classes of Buddhist gods are
<div n="lb">given in Pali in MN iii.100 ff.; Kvu 207, 208; Abhidh-s.
<div n="lb">(here called Abh) 21; Childers (Ch) 467 has a list nearly
<div n="lb">agreeing with the last; in BHS, in Mvy 3075 ff.; Dharmas
<div n="lb">127 ff.; Mv (1) ii.314.4 ff.; (2) 348.16 ff.; LV 150.2 ff.;
<div n="lb">Av i.5.1 ff. (et alibi); Divy (1) 68.12 ff.; (2) 138.19 ff.;
<div n="lb">(3) 367.9 ff.; (4) 568.24 ff.; Bbh 61.27 ff.; Gv 249.10 ff.
<div n="lb">(the last in reverse order). There are other lists, mostly
<div n="lb">fragmentary, and often so confused as to be hardly usable.
<div n="lb">The gods fall into three grand divisions: {@kāmāvacara@},
<div n="lb">living in the {@kāmadhātu@} (cf. Mvy 3071--4), usually six in
<div n="lb">number; {@rūpāvacara@}, in the {@rūpadhātu; ārūpyāva-@}
<div n="lb">{@cara@}, in the {@ārūpyadhātu@}. Cf. also the 9 {@sattvāvāsa@},
<div n="lb">Mvy 2288 ff. (Pali DN 3.263). -- {@Kāmāvacara@} (deva).
<div n="lb">The standard list is: {@cāturmahārājika@} (BHS sometimes
<div n="lb">cat°); often {@°rājakāyika@}, so in Mvy, Dharmas, Divy 2,
<div n="lb">Bbh; {@trāyastriṃśa@} (Av, Divy, Bbh, {@trayas°@}); {@yāma@}
<div n="lb">(Bbh yama); {@tuṣita@} (in Dharmas before yāma); {@nir-@}
<div n="lb">{@māṇarati@} (see also {@nirmita@}); {@paranirmitavaśavartin@}.
<div n="lb">The Gv list omits 1 and 2. Before 1, Mvy inserts {@bhauma@}
<div n="lb">and {@āntarikṣavāsin@}, making 8 instead of 6. So Mv 2
<div n="lb">prefixes bhūmyāṃ (see s.v. {@bhūmi@}) va carā (devāḥ; so
<div n="lb">read with mss.; va = eva) and {@antarīkṣecarā@}(ḥ). While
<div n="lb">no other of the above lists has these two items, {@bhauma@}
<div n="lb">and {@antarīkṣa@} (or {@antarikṣa@}; adjective) devas are asso-
<div n="lb">ciated with shorter lists (generally of kāmāvacara, or some
<div n="lb">of them, alone) in LV 266.1; 367.7 and 368.3; 396.14;
<div n="lb">401.1; and correspondingly {@bhūmya@} and {@antarīkṣecara@}
<div n="lb">(deva) in Mv i.40.14; 229.14, 15; 240.3, 4; ii.138.12 and
<div n="lb">elsewhere. --{@Rūpāvacara@} (deva) dwell in the rūpadhātu
<div n="lb">(Mvy 3073), divided into the four {@dhyāna-@}bhūmi (Mvy
<div n="lb">3084 ff., see {@dhyāna@}), the last of which includes, as its
<div n="lb">final and highest group, the {@śuddhāvāsakāyika@} gods, in
<div n="lb">five sub-groups. These being counted separately, the
<div n="lb">standard list of rūpāvacara contains usually 18 items in
<div n="lb">BHS, 16 in Pali, as follows. First dhyāna-bhūmi, usually
<div n="lb">4 items, in Pali 3: {@brahmakāyika@} (not in Pali lists, but
<div n="lb">the word occurs, acc. to Childers as an inclusive term for
<div n="lb">the classes of the first dhyāna-bhūmi; perhaps rather for
<div n="lb">all the rūpāvacara, or for them plus the arūpāvacara,
<div n="lb">since they all inhabit brahmalokas, Childers s.v.; in Gv
<div n="lb">also omitted; in Mv put second, {@brahmā@} (devā) being
<div n="lb">first in Mv 1, and {@mahābrahmā@} in Mv 2); {@brahma-@}
<div n="lb">{@pāriṣadya@} (Dharmas, LV, Divy 4 {@°pārṣadya@}, Gv {@°pār-@}
<div n="lb">{@ṣada@}; om. Mv 1, Divy 1--3, Av, Bbh; after brahmapurohita
<div n="lb">in Dharmas, LV, Mv 2, Divy 4; our order is that of Mvy,
[Page270-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">Gv, Pali); {@brahmapurohita@} (Gv omits brahma by haplo-
<div n="lb">graphy), {@mahābrahman@} (or °hma; as no. 1 in Mv 2).
<div n="lb">Second dhyāna-bhūmi, regularly 3 items in BHS and Pali;
<div n="lb">but Mv 1 and 2 and Pali MN iii.102.25 prefix another,
<div n="lb">{@ābhā(ḥ)@} (misprinted abhā in MN) devā(ḥ): {@parīttābha@}
<div n="lb">(Divy 1--3 mss. {@parītā°@}; Mv 1 omits); {@apramāṇābha@}
<div n="lb">(Mv 1 omits); {@ābhāsvara@} (Divy 3 {@apramāṇābhāsvara@}).
<div n="lb">Third dhyāna-bhūmi, regularly 3 items in BHS and Pali;
<div n="lb">Mv and Pali MN iii.102.30 add another, {@śubhā@} devāḥ
<div n="lb">(Pali subhā devā): {@parīttaśubha@} (Mv 2 omits); {@apra-@}
<div n="lb">{@māṇaśubha@} (Dharmas omits), {@śubhakṛtsna@}. Fourth
<div n="lb">dhyāna-bhūmi, usually three items in BHS, one in Pali,
<div n="lb">plus (sometimes app. included in the 4th dhy. bh. but
<div n="lb">sometimes not, cf. Childers s.v. jhānaṃ) the five śud-
<div n="lb">dhāvāsa(kāyika), who are usually not given this separate
<div n="lb">group-designation in the lists (but are so designated e.g.
<div n="lb">in Mvy 3101 and Abh): {@anabhraka@} (Pali and Mv omit);
<div n="lb">{@puṇyaprasava@} (Pali and Mv omit); {@vṛhatphala@} (so only
<div n="lb">Mvy and Mv 2 in BHS, others {@bṛh°@}, but Pali vehapphala);
<div n="lb">only in Dharmas, LV, and Abh of Pali there follows
<div n="lb">{@asaṃjñisattva@}, Pali (Abh) asaññasatta, a term which
<div n="lb">occurs as the 5th sattāvāsa in the Pali list of these DN
<div n="lb">iii.263.9 ff. (preceding the arūpadhātu), while in the cor-
<div n="lb">responding list of 9 sattvāvāsa in Mvy (2297) it is made
<div n="lb">the 9th and highest, above the arūpadhātu (an obvious
<div n="lb">error of Mvy); this item is also given in Childers's list and
<div n="lb">is needed to make up the traditional Pali number of 16
<div n="lb">rūpa-brahmaloka. Then all lists have the five {@śuddhā-@}
<div n="lb">{@vāsakāyika: avṛha@} (Av, Divy 1--3, Bbh {@abṛha@}, Gv
<div n="lb">{@abṛhat@}); {@atapa@} (Gv atapo, as s-stem); {@sudṛśa@} (Mv 1
<div n="lb">omits); {@sudarśana@} (Mv 2 omits; Divy 1 {@sudarśa@});
<div n="lb">{@akaniṣṭha@} (for the Pali forms see these words). Here
<div n="lb">Mvy alone adds as additional stages of śuddhāvāsakāyika,
<div n="lb">{@aghaniṣṭha@} and {@mahāmaheśvarāyatanam@} (see these
<div n="lb">words). -- The {@ārūpyāvacara@} gods dwell in the four
<div n="lb">{@ārūpyadhātu@} bhūmi listed (only in Mvy and Dharmas,
<div n="lb">and in Pali MN, Abh. and Childers) as {@ākāśānantyā-@}
<div n="lb">{@yatana, vijñānānantyāyatana, ākiṃcanyāyatana@}, and
<div n="lb">{@naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana@}; the gods dwelling in
<div n="lb">them are described in Dharmas as {@°āyatanopagāḥ@} (see
<div n="lb">s.v. {@upaga@}; similarly Pali °āyatanūpagā). In Suv 86.11 ff.,
<div n="lb">curiously, the first three ‘stages’, ending °āyatana, are
<div n="lb">personified as gods (°āyatanānāṃ koṭiśataṃ), while only
<div n="lb">with the last °āyatanopagatānāṃ (for °nopagānāṃ) is
<div n="lb">used. The first of the four is found in the Pali Kvu list
<div n="lb">also. For the Pali forms of the names see s.vv.
