{@yan (yaṃ) nūna@}¦, (before aham) also {@nūnam@} but in
<div n="lb">Mv {@nūnāhaṃ@}, rarely {@nūnaṃ@} (= Pali yan nūna, rarely
<div n="lb">nūnaṃ; cf. prec.), {%suppose now%}, with 1 sg. opt. or (rarely)
<div n="lb">indic.; acc. to PTSD, Pali yan nūna is or may be used
<div n="lb">in the mg. {%suppose rather%}, suggesting an alternative to
<div n="lb">some other course: once SP seems clearly to favor this;
<div n="lb">after yan nu…nirgamayeyaṃ SP 73.2--3, {%suppose I cause%}
<div n="lb">{%them to come out…%}, a tentative proposal, there follows:
<div n="lb">yan nūnam aham etān saṃcodayeyam 73.5, {%suppose%}
<div n="lb">{%rather…%}, with nūnam instead of nu; no other so clear
<div n="lb">case, but {%rather%} may, at least possibly, be meant in yaṃ
<div n="lb">nūna…SP 55.10 (vs), {%suppose%} (instead of entering nir-
<div n="lb">vāṇa) {%that I%} (reveal the Buddha-bodhi); 196.7 (vs); LV
<div n="lb">393.2 (vs); also in yan nūnāhaṃ Mv i.35.1; 37.7; 54.12;
<div n="lb">343.6; ii.117.18; but the mg. {%suppose rather%} seems hardly
<div n="lb">possible in yan nūnam aham…LV 258.21 (vs; verb here
<div n="lb">samārabhe, could be opt. or 1 sg. ind. mid.); nor in most
<div n="lb">of the following: yaṃ nūnaṃ Mv i.268.3; yan nūnāhaṃ
<div n="lb">i.51.7 (prose; verb is tiṣṭhehaṃ, see § 31.21, v.l. °eyaṃ), 14
<div n="lb">(verb is sthātum icchāmi, pres. ind.); ii.118.5, 11 (in 11,
<div n="lb">if Senart's text is right, no verb! only dats. of nouns!
<div n="lb">since adhigami and sākṣākari in 12 seems clearly aorists,
<div n="lb">statements of fact, not dependent on yan nūnāhaṃ, which
<div n="lb">is foll. by etasyaiva dharmasya prāptaye sākṣātkriyāyai;
<div n="lb">which seems to complete the sentence); 124.9; with pres.
<div n="lb">indic. verb ii.149.21 (here {%rather%} is perh. possible for yan
<div n="lb">nūnāhaṃ). In Pali, besides opt., fut. indic. is recorded:
<div n="lb">Childers 603, top of 2d column; cf. tiṣṭhehaṃ Mv i.51.7,
<div n="lb">above.
