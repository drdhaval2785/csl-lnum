{@bhrūṇa-dheya@}¦ (see {@-dheya@}), in °yam idaṃ cittaṃ
<div n="lb">niḥsāram anidarśanam Ud xxxi.4. This cpd. of -dheya not
<div n="lb">recorded in Pali; is it a false Sktization of the trouble-
<div n="lb">some Pali word bhūna-ha or °hu? This word the Pali
<div n="lb">comms. seem evidently to misunderstand. Cf. Renou,
<div n="lb">JA 1939, p. 348 with n. 1, who connects the Pali word
<div n="lb">with Vedic and Skt. bhrūṇa-han; acc. to his note 1, the
<div n="lb">Skt. form is to be ‘restored’ in Dharmasamuccaya 16.8.
<div n="lb">Renou apparently did not know our BHS form, which
<div n="lb">seems only to complicate the question further. It is clear,
<div n="lb">in any case, that it is an uncomplimentary epithet. The
<div n="lb">Pali comms. interpret the Pali as {%destroying prosperity%} or
<div n="lb">{%welfare%}.
