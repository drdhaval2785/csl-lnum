{@Dharmacinti(n)@}¦, {%‘thinking on the Doctrine’%}, perhaps
<div n="lb">n. of a previous incarnation of Śākyamuni (otherwise
<div n="lb">unrecorded): LV 170.17 (vs). Tib. chos sems confirms the
<div n="lb">meaning; but it lacks the connective daṅ, which occurs
<div n="lb">after each of the other three names in the line; accordingly
<div n="lb">it seems to have understood this word as an epithet of
<div n="lb">the following Arcimān.
