{@apacitā@}¦, {%honor, respect%}: Mv ii.259.9 paramāya apa-
<div n="lb">citāya, and 260.3 °māye °tāye, both instr. sg. I do not
<div n="lb">find the stem (= °citi) so natural as Senart does (ii.544),
<div n="lb">and it seems to be unrecorded elsewhere; but there seems
<div n="lb">no doubt of its reality. Cf., perhaps, § 10.142.
