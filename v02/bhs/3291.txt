{@ujjaṅkikā@}¦, some kind of attitude or behavior which
<div n="lb">monks must avoid in begging food: Mvy 8546 nojjaṅki-
<div n="lb">kayā (instr.). Tib. ḥjol thabs su (? perhaps {%with robe%}
<div n="lb">{%dragging%}, sc. on the ground?); Chin. (here) apparently
<div n="lb">{%pulling at clothes while walking%}; elsewhere, acc. to Wogihara,
<div n="lb">Lex. 41, Chin. {%walking on tiptoe%}, and so Jap. on Mvy. The
<div n="lb">pw 7.322 says the ‘correct’ reading would be ujjakṣikā,
<div n="lb">and Wogihara, Lex. 41, suggests that the corresponding
<div n="lb">Pali is ujjhaggikā (or rather, by em. ujjagghikā), Vin.
<div n="lb">iv.187.16, which means {%laughing, derision%}, see {@uccagghati@};
<div n="lb">this seems indeed quite possible.
