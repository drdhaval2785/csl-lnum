{@sānu-kālam@}¦, adv., {%at%} (some specified, but to me

<div n="lb">sānu = {@sānuka@} (prec., q.v.), {%at the time of the sānu(ka)%}
<div n="lb">{%muhūrta%}; but that muhūrta occurs in the first half of the
<div n="lb">night acc. to Divy 643.24, while this passage clearly refers
<div n="lb">to daytime.
