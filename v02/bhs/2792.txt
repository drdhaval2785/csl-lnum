{@ābṛhati@}¦ (and āvṛhati; see also {@āvṛṃhati@}) both occur
<div n="lb">in Skt. in mg. {%extracts, draws out%}, and in Pali as abbahati,
<div n="lb">abbuhati, abbū°, abbāheti, id. (as, thorns); both are so used
<div n="lb">also in BHS; but in BHS they both (oftener, it seems,
<div n="lb">spelled with v) have also the meaning exclusively noted
<div n="lb">for {@āvarhati@}, {%restores%} (a monk to good standing), which in
<div n="lb">Pali is abbheti (noun, abbhāna), apparently from Skt.
<div n="lb">āhvayati. I shall record such mgs., even where texts read
<div n="lb">āb°, under {@āvarhati@}; in BHS the two groups are not clearly
<div n="lb">distinguishable. They may even be identical in origin, as
<div n="lb">N. Dutt holds, MSV iii.74 n. 3 ({%withdrawal of offences%}
<div n="lb">committed by the monk implies restoration to good stand-
<div n="lb">ing); so also in essence, tho doubtfully, Finot, Prāt 488 n. 1.
<div n="lb">But on this theory it is hard to explain Pali abbheti
<div n="lb">(abbhāna), and I incline to believe that BHS has a second-
<div n="lb">ary and confused blend, in which a form close to the Pali,
<div n="lb">meaning {%recall%}, was adapted to the word meaning {%extract,%}
<div n="lb">{%remove%}.
