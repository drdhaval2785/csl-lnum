{@citrī-karoti@}¦ (= Pali citti°, perhaps also cittī°, see
<div n="lb">next; derived by Childers and PTSD from Skt. citta-;
<div n="lb">Senart, Mv i.444, accepts this and regards BHS citrī°
<div n="lb">as false Sktization; later, he emends the forms occurring
<div n="lb">in Mv ii and iii to cittī°; whatever the history of the
<div n="lb">word may be, the BHS form is only citrī° or citri°); ({@1@})

<div n="lb">is clear that citrīkṛtau here applies always to the two

<div n="lb">evident to me; possibly {%made elaborate%}, by intertwining
<div n="lb">the fingers (which is apparently characteristic of these
