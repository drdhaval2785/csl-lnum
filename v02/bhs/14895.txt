<div n="lb">entertained the Bodhisattva: atha bodhisattvo yenaiva

<div n="lb">rigs ldan (see below) kyi gnas, {%the dwelling of a person%}
<div n="lb">{%of brahman family(?)%}. Note that immediately after this,
<div n="lb">line 7, the Bodhisattva visits and is entertained by another
<div n="lb">brahman woman, named {@Padmā@} (this time so named in
<div n="lb">Tib.); the two statements are closely parallel. The Tib.
