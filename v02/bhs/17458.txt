{@sparśa-vihāra-tā@}¦ (once by error °vihāri-tā; etym.,
<div n="lb">see below), {%state of comfort, agreeable condition%}: SP 248.6;
<div n="lb">Bhīk 26a.3; in comp. with preceding sukha-, Kv 18.8
<div n="lb">(here text erroneously °vihāri-tā); 89.13; oftener with
<div n="lb">sukhaṃ as separate and parallel near-synonym, Mv

<div n="lb">i.326.1; ii.93.16. See {@asparśavihāra@}; and {@phāsu, phāsa,@}
<div n="lb">{@(a)phāṣa(ka)@}. The Pali equivalent is (a)phāsu(ka), often
<div n="lb">with vihāra; and AMg. has phāsuya (-vihāra). Pischel 208
<div n="lb">derives from *sparśuka; Skt. sparśavant, BHS {@sparśana-@}
<div n="lb">{@vant@}, {%pleasant to touch%}, suggest how the development of
<div n="lb">mg. might conceivably have taken place, but Pischel's
<div n="lb">form is unrecorded. In BHS sparśa- is the regular form in
<div n="lb">this cpd., but others occur, see above. It may be only a
<div n="lb">hyper-Sktism. The -u of the stem seems to be universally
<div n="lb">found in Pali and Pkt., and occurs in BHS, but never
<div n="lb">followed by -ka, a fact which is not helpful to Pischel's
<div n="lb">etymology. The Jain Skt. form is prāsuka, interpreted
<div n="lb">as {%free from living creatures%} (pra-asu; of a dwelling, vihāra,
<div n="lb">suitable for Jain monks); this looks like a fanciful hyper-
<div n="lb">Sktism. Various other etymologies have been suggested,
<div n="lb">see the Pali Dictt.; none are convincing. Note the use of
<div n="lb">phāsuṃ, phāṣaṃ as adverbs with viharati.The forms
<div n="lb">phāsa, phāṣa are recorded only in BHS.
