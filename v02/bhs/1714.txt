<L>1714<pc>060,1<k1>aBOti<k2>aBOti-
{@? abhauti-@}¦, in Laṅk 17.5, text abhauti-bhautikānām;
<div n="lb">Suzuki {%things created and uncreated%}; the mss. are very
<div n="lb">confused; some simply abhautikānāṃ; perhaps read
[Page060-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">abhautika-bhaut° (and perhaps render rather {%of things%}
<div n="lb">{%non-elemental and elemental%}). Surely no stem abhauti
<div n="lb">should be recognized. See {@bhautika@} (2); one possible
<div n="lb">reading for the above passage might be bhūta-bhauti-
<div n="lb">kānām, {%of gross elements and%} (subsidiary elements or)
<div n="lb">{%sense-objects%}.
