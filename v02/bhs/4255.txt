{@osaraṇa@}¦, nt. (to next; = Pali id.), {%entrance, approach%}:
<div n="lb">Mv ii.37.9 osaraṇe (mss. osakaṇe) ca bharitā addaśi
<div n="lb">pramadā, {%at the entrance%} (to the king's palace)…(other-
<div n="lb">wise Senart); ii.108.8 kasya eṣa osaraṇaśabdaḥ (? mss.
<div n="lb">te saraṇa°, or te śaraśa°), {%whose noise of approach is this?%}
<div n="lb">In Mv iii.401.1 osaraṇāni, in a line otherwise hopelessly
<div n="lb">corrupt, corresponds to the same word in the same vs
<div n="lb">of Pali Sn 538, the rest of which seems also corrupt (so
<div n="lb">ed.); the comm. says it means {%heretical views%} (ogahanāni
<div n="lb">titthāni, diṭṭhiyo). Senart's em. and interpretation of the
<div n="lb">line are unconvincing; but the Pali is also dubious, and
<div n="lb">its comm. questionable. I cannot solve the problem.
