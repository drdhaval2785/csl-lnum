{@aprati-varṇanīya@}¦, in LV 411.10, {%incomparably%}
<div n="lb">{%worthy of praise%}, in a list of complimentary epithets of
<div n="lb">sounds (śabda), after nirvarṇanīya, {%praiseworthy%}. I believe
<div n="lb">that aprati- must be recognized as used in Skt. as prior
<div n="lb">element in cpds. in this sense, as e.g. in aprati-cakra
<div n="lb">(pw) and aprati-karman (commonly analyzed as a-prati-
<div n="lb">karman; but there is no record of any *pratikarman in
<div n="lb">the sense of {%a corresponding action%}, and the immediate
<div n="lb">constituents seem to me clearly aprati and karman).
<div n="lb">Tib. zla med pa, {%matchless%}, for aprati.
