{@agha@}¦, m. (= Pali id.), ({@1@}) {%sky, atmosphere%}; only in
<div n="lb">{@aghaniṣṭha@}, q.v.; ({@2@}) in the {@lokāntarikā@} (q.v.) passage,
<div n="lb">aghā aghasaṃvṛtā(ḥ) or aghasphuṭā(ḥ) (or other cpd.)
<div n="lb">means {%miseries (? miserable) and enclosed by%} ({%full of%}, or the
<div n="lb">like) {%miseries%}; so essentially Senart, Mv i note 405 f.
<div n="lb">We could perhaps recognize the first agha as an adj. (so
<div n="lb">in RV and once in BhāgP.); but it seems more likely that
<div n="lb">it is the more familiar noun, which esp. in Pali often means
<div n="lb">{%misery%}. In the Pali version (CPD s.v. ^2agha, end) we
<div n="lb">should read aghā aghasaṃvutā, as Senart perceived
<div n="lb">(texts asaṃvutā, a very old corruption); or at least, that
[Page005-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">must have been the original version. The CPD assumes
<div n="lb">an otherwise unknown adj. agha, {%aerial, without support%},
<div n="lb">which is inappropriate and implausible.
