{@jāla, jālaka@}¦, nt., prob. {%bouquet of flowers%} (here
<div n="lb">withered ones, to be removed from caityas); so jālaka is
<div n="lb">used in Skt.; the only plausible alternative would be
<div n="lb">{%spider-web%}, which jāla also means in Skt. (cf. Schmidt,
<div n="lb">Nachträge) and Pali. In any case it means something
<div n="lb">the {%removal%} of which from caityas is a work of merit:
<div n="lb">yo jālakāni apanaye (so read with v.l. for Senart upanaye)
<div n="lb">cetiyeṣu Mv ii.391.3; choretva jālaṃ jinacetiyeṣu 391.22,
<div n="lb">repeated in the sequel; parallel Śikṣ 306.2, 4 choritva
<div n="lb">jālaṃ; 6, 8, 10 apanīya (ed. em. upa°) jālaṃ. On the
<div n="lb">passage, misunderstood by Senart and Bendall, see s.v.
<div n="lb">{@chorayati@}. In the immediately following verses, Mv
<div n="lb">ii.392.21 ff., Śikṣ 306.11 ff., the meritorious removal of
<div n="lb">withered flowers is unambiguously mentioned.
