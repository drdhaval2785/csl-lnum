{@ploti@}¦, f., see also next, and {@-plotika@}, ifc. Bhvr.
<div n="lb">(= {@pilotika@}, q.v.; Skt. ploti, {%piece of cloth%}, so read with
<div n="lb">Gaṇapati Sastri for plauti of Shama Sastri, Kauṭ Arth.,
<div n="lb">Shama S.^1 80.9, in ii.11; also Skt. plota; both for *proti,
<div n="lb">*prota, from Skt. pra-vayati; note the denom. ger. pro-
<div n="lb">tayitvā, implying protayati, thrice in KātyŚrS, see BR;
<div n="lb">this seems to mean {%having fastened, tied on%} or {%in%}, which
<div n="lb">implies a meaning like that here suggested for the under-
<div n="lb">lying noun *proti or *prota), seems to mean {%cord%}, as
<div n="lb">{%connecting link%} or {%bond%}: chiefly in karma-ploti, e.g. pūrvikā
<div n="lb">°tir vyākṛtā bhavati Divy 150.24, {%the previous action-%}
<div n="lb">{%(binding-) cord has been explained%}; so, regularly with forms
<div n="lb">of vyākaroti, Divy 87.8; 89.5; 241.25-26; Av i.242.9;

<div n="lb">Both Mvy and Av use this cpd. in a cliché occurring in
<div n="lb">Pali, e.g. MN i.141.21; here the comm. ii.119.19 ff. ex-
<div n="lb">plains chinna-pilotiko (of dhammo) as {%having its rags cut%}
<div n="lb">{%off%}, like a fresh garment (cf. {@pilotika@}, 1), but he offers
<div n="lb">two different, and equally fantastic, explanations of the
<div n="lb">specific application of the term, and gives the impression
<div n="lb">that he is merely guessing.
