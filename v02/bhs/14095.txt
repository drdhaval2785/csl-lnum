({@vimāna@}¦, nt. and m., = Skt. id.; on use in Pali,
<div n="lb">see elaborate article in PTSD; even in Skt., see BR, it is
<div n="lb">not exclusively used of divine, nor yet of mobile, residences,
<div n="lb">but may apply to any luxurious dwelling-place, which
<div n="lb">in India would naturally include the surrounding grounds;
<div n="lb">see Mrs. Rhys Davids, Minor Anthologies of the Pali
<div n="lb">Canon Part IV, 1942, p. vi: ‘…more than houses, in-
<div n="lb">cluding gardens, woods, lakes’ etc… ‘{%estates%} might have
<div n="lb">been more literally correct’, but she uses {%mansions%}; several
<div n="lb">times in Jm the word is applied to something located in
<div n="lb">woods and used by a king for amusement; Speyer {%arbors%},
<div n="lb">pw 7.375 ‘etwa {%Hain’%}, but surely buildings seem to be
<div n="lb">involved: vimāna-deśeṣu Jm 182.22, 183.3; the king takes
<div n="lb">a siesta śrīmati °na-pradeśe 183.10; the king stays for a
<div n="lb">time śrīmati pravivikte °na-deśe 192.23; vane manoharo-
<div n="lb">dyāna-°na-bhūṣite 208.20. Pali certainly also uses the
<div n="lb">word, as does Skt. more commonly, of the air-traveling
<div n="lb">palaces of the gods; and I question whether either Pali
<div n="lb">or BHS gives it any meaning which could not be matched
<div n="lb">in Skt. On Divy 399.18, where pw also sees the meaning
<div n="lb">{%Hain%}, see {@Śairīṣaka@}; nothing in the context suggests any
<div n="lb">reason for departure from the common meaning, {%celestial%},
<div n="lb">and no doubt {%mobile, palace%}.)
