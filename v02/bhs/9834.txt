{@prakāra?@}¦ in SP 146.5 (vs) puṣpaiḥ (so all mss., KN
<div n="lb">em. puṣpa-, kept by WT without note) prakāraiḥ sama-
<div n="lb">laṃkṛtaṃ ca; acc. to Tib. {%adorned with many flowers%} (me
<div n="lb">tog maṅ pos). On the face of the reading of the mss. and
<div n="lb">the Tib. rendering, prakāra should be an adj., {%many%}; it is
<div n="lb">otherwise known only as a noun, {%kind, sort%}. KN's em.
<div n="lb">hardly helps; {%with kinds of flowers%} could not, so far as I
<div n="lb">know, serve as a substitute for {%with many kinds…%}; for
<div n="lb">this we should expect bahu-, nānā-, or the like, modifying
<div n="lb">prakāra. I have thought of reading pravāraiḥ, taking it
<div n="lb">as = pravaraiḥ, {%excellent%}, with ā for a m.c.; but Tib. does
<div n="lb">not support this.
