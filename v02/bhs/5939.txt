({@grāmika@}¦, m., prob. only {%village headman%}, as in Skt.,
<div n="lb">and as Pali gāmika; °kā, f. {%a woman belonging to a village%}
<div n="lb">{%headman's family%}. Senart [repeatedly in his Introd., on
<div n="lb">the passages below] understands simply {%villager%}: grāmika,
<div n="lb">m., Mv i.301.8 ff.; 303.12 ff. (his daughter was attended
<div n="lb">by serving-women, 302.16); {@Sujātā@}, q.v., was a grāmika-
<div n="lb">duhitā LV 265.11 or °dhītā Mv ii.263.15--16; 299.9, or
<div n="lb">grāmikasya dhītā ii.200.17; she is called simply a grāmikā
<div n="lb">Mv ii.131.10, but this doubtless has the mg. suggested
<div n="lb">above. Cf. also grāmika-gharaṃ āgami (in search of
<div n="lb">food) Mv ii.200.16.)
