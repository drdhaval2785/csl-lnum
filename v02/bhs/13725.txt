{@vi(c)chandayati@}¦, for which forms of vi-chind- occur
[Page484-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">in mss., cf. also {@vicchindika@} and prec.; see Wogihara,
<div n="lb">Lex. (mss. vary in Bbh between a and i); in Pali (kāya-)-
<div n="lb">vicchinda occurs as title of Jāt. 293, surely meaning
<div n="lb">{%aversion from the body%}, not {%cutting off of…%}; in Pv. comm.
<div n="lb">129.26 atidānato vicchinditukāmo clearly means {%wanting%}
<div n="lb">{%to dissuade from over-generosity%}, = BHS vi-chand-; Pali
<div n="lb">(kāya-)vicchandaniya(-kathā) and (kāya-)vicchandanika-
<div n="lb">(-sutta) cannot be separated from (kāya-)vicchinda, above;
<div n="lb">in Divy 590.24 even the v.l. vicchedayām āsuḥ occurs for
<div n="lb">vicchandayām āsuḥ. It is clear that Pali and BHS both
<div n="lb">show what must, therefore, be a very old confusion between
<div n="lb">chand- and -chi(n)d- here. As Kern (cited PTSD s.v.
<div n="lb">vicchinda), Wogihara, and some others have seen, the
<div n="lb">orig. form was surely {@vicchandayati@}; the forms with
<div n="lb">chi(n)d- are due to popular etym. (in some occurrences
<div n="lb">the word means something close to {%cuts off%}). The funda-
<div n="lb">mental mg. is {%makes undesirous%} (denom., vi plus chanda);
<div n="lb">so Tib. mos pa zlog pa on Mvy, ḥdun pa zlog on KP,
<div n="lb">both mg. {%desire-deterring, desire-dissuading%}, but on LV
<div n="lb">simply zlog par byed pa, {%dissuasion-(deterring-)making%}:
<div n="lb">°dayati Mvy 6527, foll. by vicakṣuḥ-karaṇāya; bhūyo-
<div n="lb">bhūyaḥ sa māṃ °dayati, bhadramukhāniṣṭo 'sya karmaṇo

<div n="lb">āsuḥ (v.l. see above) 590.24; (Māraḥ…) bodhisattvaṃ

<div n="lb">1185.19, modulated in the sequel (the means of dissuasion
<div n="lb">are given 1186.1 ff.; they consist of attacks on the dog-
<div n="lb">matic interpretation of Buddhism accepted in this school);

<div n="lb">and 335.10 (prose), {%dissuade, discourage Māra%} (by pre-

<div n="lb">thing dissuaded from is expressed it is regularly abl.,
<div n="lb">dānād vicchandayan Jm 24.7; (saṃgrahavastubhyo) vic-
<div n="lb">chandya Śikṣ 50.12; adattādānād °dayati Gv 155.15;
<div n="lb">vichandya (v.l. vichindya) with ablatives Bbh 16.2 ff.,
<div n="lb">so also °dayet 27.12; °dayati (v.l. °chind°) 262.13; but
<div n="lb">once apparently acc., (yasmāt tvaṃ bhikṣucaraṇapranā-
<div n="lb">maṃ) māṃ °dayitum icchasi Divy 383.6, {%since you wish%}
<div n="lb">{%to dissuade me%} (against, from) {%bowing at the feet of monks%}
<div n="lb">(or is this acc. a Bhvr. adj., {%me characterized by bowing%}
<div n="lb">etc. ?).
