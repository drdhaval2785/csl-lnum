{@ucchitya?@}¦ seemingly ger.; so mss., Divy 103.22
<div n="lb">…unmādam api prāpnoty ucchitya vā kālaṃ karoti.
<div n="lb">Ed. em. ucchritya, which seems to make no sense; it
<div n="lb">means {%having lifted, raised up%}, trans., and there is no
<div n="lb">object here; even if intrans., {%having risen%}, I do not see
<div n="lb">that it makes sense. There is some corruption, but I see
<div n="lb">no good em.
