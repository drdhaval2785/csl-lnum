{@āgati-gati@}¦, nt. dvandva, {%coming and going%} (in succes-
<div n="lb">sive births): Mv i.4.7 (prose), read sattvānām āgatigati
<div n="lb">(so one ms., the rest °gami; Senart em. °gatiṃ) vividhaṃ
<div n="lb">(so, or °dha, all mss.; Senart em. °dhāṃ) bhagavāṃ
<div n="lb">abhijñāsi. Cf. Mv i.9.2 (vs) sattvānām āgatiṃ gatiṃ (here
<div n="lb">āgatiṃ, rather than °ti, is required by meter). The two
<div n="lb">words are often collocated in this sense in Pali; this use
<div n="lb">of each of them individually is, however, not foreign
<div n="lb">to Skt.
