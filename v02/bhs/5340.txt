{@kṣaṇika@}¦, adj., {%empty%} (of the hands): read in Mv
<div n="lb">ii.252.14 kṣaṇikena (Senart °tena with 1 ms., v.l. kṣami-
<div n="lb">kena) hastena gṛhaṃ gacchati, hato bhavati, {%went home%}
<div n="lb">{%empty-handed and was depressed%} (of a fowler who caught
<div n="lb">no birds); iii.171.6, read svakaṃ ca hastaṃ kṣaṇikaṃ (so
<div n="lb">1 ms., v.l. kṣeṇikaṃ; Senart em. implausibly) paśyati
<div n="lb">(having given away a beautiful lotus, and now regretting
<div n="lb">the gift); repeated 171.9. Is this an extension of the mg.
<div n="lb">of JM. khaṇika, {%idle, unemployed, out of work%} (which is
<div n="lb">itself derived from Skt. kṣaṇin, {%at leisure%})? In any case
<div n="lb">the two Mv passages confirm each other; kṣaṇika is
<div n="lb">certainly the true form in both, and the mg. is certain.
