{@? cetayika@}¦ (v.l. ve°), Mv iii.442.10, some sort of enter-
<div n="lb">tainer. Form and mg. alike obscure; no correspondent in
<div n="lb">parallel passages iii.113.4 (see Senart's note here) etc. If
<div n="lb">the reading ve- were accepted, one might think of reading
<div n="lb">vetālika or °ḍika (Skt. vaitālika), were it not for the fact
<div n="lb">that this word seems likely to have been read in 442.8
<div n="lb">in the same list (Senart here tālika, but mss. vetaddika,
<div n="lb">vetarddi°), and in 113.2 Senart em. vaitālika for mss.
<div n="lb">tetalika, tetarika.
