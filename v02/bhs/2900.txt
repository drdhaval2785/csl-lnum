{@ārāva@}¦, nt., a high number: Mvy 7839 = Tib. rig(s)
<div n="lb">sdom; cited from Gv; var. {@agava@}, q.v. But Gv 133.3 reads
<div n="lb">{@avaga@} (nt.), which has the same Tib. rendering Mvy
<div n="lb">7713 and is probably to be read for ārāva. Mironov reads
<div n="lb">arāvam, noting vv.ll. agavam, aravam. In Gv 105.21
<div n="lb">replaced by {@vipāsa@}.
