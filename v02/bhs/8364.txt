{@? nirgarati@}¦, perhaps rather nirgalati, {%spits out%}: LV
<div n="lb">306.21 (prose) nirgaranto; but best mss. nirgalanto; object
<div n="lb">ayoguḍāni, {%spitting forth%}. Cf. BR s.v. gal plus nis, nirgali-
<div n="lb">tāmbugarbhaṃ śaradghanam Ragh. 5.17, which could
<div n="lb">very well mean {%an autumn cloud that has ejected its water-%}
<div n="lb">{%content%}. On the other hand, nirgīrṇa is recorded in BR
<div n="lb">once from Rām. Neither nir-gṝ nor nir-gal seems recorded
<div n="lb">otherwise, in Skt. or MIndic. Since galati is the regular
<div n="lb">present to gal, it seems more likely that the best mss. of
<div n="lb">LV have the true form, nirgalanto.
