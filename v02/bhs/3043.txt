{@āśītakī@}¦, or {@ās°@}, also written aśītaka, aśīta, aśitaka,
<div n="lb">asita, the a-stems being prob. m. (Mv ii.231.13); the Pali
<div n="lb">equivalent is āsītika, m. (not °kā, f., as stated in PTSD),
<div n="lb">n. of some plant; occurs, regularly in comp. with -parvāṇi
<div n="lb">(as in Pali with -pabbāni, MN i.80.11 = 245.27), in the
<div n="lb">account of the Bodhisattva's emaciated state after his
<div n="lb">long fast, his members being compared to the joints of
<div n="lb">this plant. The reading asita(ka) is prob. due to popular
<div n="lb">etymology, association with asita {%black%}; {@kāla@}, q.v., occurs
<div n="lb">in the context, and note kālāśītako (perhaps read °ke
<div n="lb">with v.l.) Mv ii.231.13. Other cases, all in comp. with
<div n="lb">parvāṇi: LV 254.7 āsītakī-; 255.21 āśītakī- (all mss.;
<div n="lb">Lefm. inexplicably reads āsitakī- here!); Mv ii.126.18
<div n="lb">aśītaka- (v.l. asita-); in 125.12 Senart omits the word
<div n="lb">with one ms., but the other ms. has aśita-parvāṇi; 128.5
<div n="lb">aśitaka- (one ms., the other omits, Senart em. aśītaka-);
<div n="lb">129.7 aśīta- (v.l. asita-). The evidence points, on the whole,
<div n="lb">to āśītaka- or °kī- as the original form.
