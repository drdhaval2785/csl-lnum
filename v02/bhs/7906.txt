{@Dhānyadrāhyāyaṇa@}¦ (so read for ed. °drāyāyaṇa;
<div n="lb">see the readings of the corrupt mss., some of which sup-
<div n="lb">port this, the obviously correct reading), pl., n. of a brah-
<div n="lb">manical gotra: Divy 635.19. This passage is omitted in
<div n="lb">two Chin. translations, my colleague Prof. Rahder informs
<div n="lb">me. Cf. {@Dhyāna-drāhyāyaṇī@}, where Chin. seems more
<div n="lb">favorable to initial Dhā- rather than Dhyā-. It seems that
<div n="lb">one or the other of these two must be an error, and per-
<div n="lb">haps Dhānya- should be read in both.
