{@grahaṇa@}¦, nt., confused with {@gahana@}, {%thicket, entan-%}
<div n="lb">{%glement%} (?): in Mv i.34.7 (prose) -durga-saṃsāra-kāntāra-
<div n="lb">grahaṇa-dāruṇāto mahā-prapātāto uddharitvā, Senart
<div n="lb">thinks that grahaṇa is a copyist's hyper-Skt. alteration
<div n="lb">of gahana, which is a near-synonym of kāntāra (esp. in
<div n="lb">Pali, where diṭṭhi-kantāra and diṭṭhi-gahana are often
<div n="lb">closely associated); in spite of this, I think grahaṇa may
<div n="lb">be sound and orig.: {%rescuing from a great abyss that is%}
<div n="lb">{%dreadful because of the grip of the forest of the saṃsāra etc%}.
<div n="lb">In Mv i.91.14--17 occur four lines of verse in which the
<div n="lb">mss. repeatedly vary between gahana and grahaṇa; the
<div n="lb">text is both very corrupt and fragmentary; Senart's note
<div n="lb">is a very earnest effort to disentangle it, but I find it
<div n="lb">hardly convincing, tho I am inclined to agree that puns
<div n="lb">are here contained, involving gahana, {%entanglement,%}
<div n="lb">{%obstruction, difficulty%}, as well as {%thicket%}, and grahaṇa,
<div n="lb">{%seizure, imprisonment%} (perhaps also {%eclipse%}, as by Rāhu,
<div n="lb">so Skt.); the text, with the most important vv.ll., reads:
<div n="lb">14 vanagahanaṃ (mss. °grahanaṃ or °ṇaṃ) balagahanaṃ
<div n="lb">(3 mss. °grah°) girigahanāni (em.; 5 mss. °gahanaṃ, one
<div n="lb">°grahaṇaṃ) tyāgagrahaṇāni (3 mss. °gahanāni), 15 viṣa-
<div n="lb">māprati- (mss. viṣamapati-)-saṃniṣaṇṇavanāni tu manu-
<div n="lb">ṣyagahanāni (5 mss. °graha°), 16 tṛṇagulmakaṇṭakalatā-
<div n="lb">kulāni vṛkṣagrahaṇā- (mss. °grahaṇya- or °nya-) gahanāni
<div n="lb">(3 mss. grahaṇāni), 17 śaṭhanikṛtipaiśunyāni tu manuṣya-
<div n="lb">gahanāni (5 mss. °grahanāni or °ṇāni). Tho Senart's
<div n="lb">interpretation seems very dubious, I cannot suggest with
<div n="lb">confidence any improvements. The meter is meant for
<div n="lb">āryā. See also {@gahana, gahana-tā@}.
