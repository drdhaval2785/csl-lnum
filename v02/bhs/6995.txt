{@tuṇa@}¦ (m. or nt.; cf. {@tūṇa, tuṇava@}; AMg. tuṇā [tuṇa?],
<div n="lb">an unidentified mus. instrument), some musical instru-
<div n="lb">ment: in lists, tuṇa-paṇava-mṛdaṅgāṃ LV 80.5; tuṇa-
<div n="lb">veṇu-(text vaiṇu-)-ravaiḥ 173.9; tuṇa-vīṇā-sughoṣakādi-
<div n="lb">bhiḥ 177.14. Tib. confused; it may intend this word by
<div n="lb">rgyud gcig (pa) in the first two (see under {@tuṇava@}), but
<div n="lb">if so the order varies from our text; on 177.14 this Tib.
<div n="lb">word does not occur, and tuṇa may be gliṅ bu (otherwise
<div n="lb">= veṇu or vaṃśa), altho the order suggests sgra sñan,
<div n="lb">but this elsewhere = sughoṣaka. In spite of Tib., which
<div n="lb">suggests a stringed (or in 177.14 a wind?) instrument,
<div n="lb">perhaps really a kind of {%drum%}.
