2 {@uttarya@}¦, ger., in Kv 32.17 vāmanakarūpam abhinir-
<div n="lb">māya, mṛgājinenottarya, veṇudaṇḍam upagṛhya…,
<div n="lb">evidently {%covering%} (with a deerskin). Cf. 1 {@uttarya@}. As
<div n="lb">a ger. the form seems inexplicable, unless as an extension
<div n="lb">of the Skt. usage with ut-thā-, ut-tambh-; is a MIndic
<div n="lb">uttharya intended (to utstarati, see s.v. {@uttharati@}, =
<div n="lb">stṛṇoti; or to Skt. ava plus stṛ-)? Note that Kv is also
<div n="lb">the only text where 1 uttarya is recorded; has the noun
<div n="lb">influenced the form of the gerund?
