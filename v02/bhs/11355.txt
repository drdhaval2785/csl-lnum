{@bhautika@}¦, (adj.?) subst. nt. (cf. Skt. id.; here in
<div n="lb">specialized mgs.), ({@1@}) possibly adj., {%real%} or {%material%}, in
<div n="lb">Laṅk 17.5, but the reading is very doubtful and the sense
<div n="lb">at least equally so, see s.v. {@abhauti@} and below; ({@2@}) subst.
<div n="lb">nt., {%object of sense%}: in Dharmas 40 = viṣaya or indriyārtha
<div n="lb">(five are listed: rūpa, śabda, gandha, rasa, and sparśa,
<div n="lb">corresponding, tho in different order, to the five mahā-
<div n="lb">bhūtāni listed in 39 just before). Acc. to Suzuki's Index to
<div n="lb">Laṅk, the Chin. versions of Laṅk indicate bhautika = {%the%}
[Page413-a+ 52]
<div n="lb">{%4 viṣaya%} or {%color, odor, flavor, contact%} (note omission of
<div n="lb">{%sound%}, and the fact that in Laṅk 124.8 ākāśa is added
<div n="lb">only parenthetically; cf. the 4 dhātu of Pali, paṭhavī-,
<div n="lb">āpo-, tejo-, vāyo-dhātu, Childers, s.v.); in Laṅk 205.10
<div n="lb">(omit bhūta-with 2 mss.) bhautika-svalakṣaṇa-vināśānu-
<div n="lb">palabdhir, evidently {%products of the bhūtāni%}, presumably
<div n="lb">as in Dharmas 40. The passage Laṅk 123.11--124.16 must,
<div n="lb">it seems, somehow be interpreted in the light of these
<div n="lb">passages, but is obscure to me (cf. also Laṅk 355.1). Suzuki
<div n="lb">is not very helpful on it; e.g. 124.13 na tu mahābhū-
<div n="lb">tānām certainly cannot mean {%which%} (primary elements)
<div n="lb">{%are non-existent%}, but rather: (the mahābhūtāni are the
<div n="lb">causes of the bhautikāni), {%but not%} (the bhautikāni) {%of the%}
<div n="lb">{%mahābhūtāni%}, i.e. {%but not vice versa%}. In Mvy 1847 bhau-
<div n="lb">tika-rūpam appears to be parallel and complementary to
<div n="lb">1846 {@upādāya-rūpam@}, q.v.; this suggests that bhautika-
<div n="lb">rūpam = Pali bhūta-rūpa (Childers and PTSD s.v. rūpa),
<div n="lb">which acc. to Vism. = the four mahābhūtāni, earth, water,
<div n="lb">fire, and air (listed Mvy 1838--1841), contrary to Dharmas
<div n="lb">and the Chin. as cited by Suzuki, above; for the viṣayas
<div n="lb">are included among the 24 upādā(ya)-rūpa of Pali. On
<div n="lb">the basis of Mvy 1846--7 we might conjecture that in Laṅk
<div n="lb">17.5 (see {@abhauti@}) abhautika = upādāya(-rūpam), and
<div n="lb">bhautika = bhautika (Pali bhūta)-rūpam. But if Dharmas
<div n="lb">and Chin. are right, bhautika would mean virtually the
<div n="lb">opposite of Pali bhūta(-rūpa).
