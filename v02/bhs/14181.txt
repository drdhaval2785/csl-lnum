<L>14181<pc>499,1<k1>vivara<k2>vivara
{@vivara, (1)@}¦ nt., a fairly high number: Mvy 7853
<div n="lb">(= Tib. yal yol), cited from Gv, which in 105.25 has
<div n="lb">{@vivana@}, while Gv 133 omits the item; it corresponds to
<div n="lb">{@vipatha@} of Mvy 7727; ({@2@}) m. or nt., a much higher number:
<div n="lb">°raḥ Mvy 7782, °ram 7911, both = Tib. bsñad yas; the
<div n="lb">latter cited from Gv but not found in either Gv list (106
<div n="lb">or 133); ({@3@}) by corruption for viṃvara or {@bimbara@} (q.v.),
<div n="lb">LV 147.22 (but this is cited from LV in Mvy 7958--9 as
<div n="lb">viṃvara, and LV itself in 151.3 (vs) has bimbarāś); also
<div n="lb">SP 409.6 (prose) has in text vivara, intending this same
<div n="lb">unit as is shown by the preceding {@kaṅkara@}; vv.ll. of SP
<div n="lb">quoted as viśvara, visvara, certainly intending viṃvara
<div n="lb">or bimbara.
