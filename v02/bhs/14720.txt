<L>14720<pc>519,1<k1>vyAskandaka<k2>vyAskandaka-
{@vyāskandaka-@}¦, a kind of {@samāpatti@}, q.v.: Mvy
<div n="lb">1497 (Mironov {@vya°@}). Tib. renders by snrel zhi, which
<div n="lb">usually = {@vyatyasta@} (q.v. 2), and Mvy ed. suggests
<div n="lb">reading so; cf. {@vyutkrāntaka@}. It would seem to be, like
<div n="lb">the latter, a manner of skipping from one trance-state
<div n="lb">to a non-adjoining one. But Chin. has the equivalent of
<div n="lb">nāsaṃjñāyatana, which as Ting says seems ‘an abbre-
<div n="lb">viation’ (the last part) of {@naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana@}.
