<div n="lb">{%this exhibition of supernatural power%}, viz, the making of the

<div n="lb">(2, above)? Near synonyms are {@āveśa@}, (Skt.) anubhāva,
<div n="lb">{@adhimukti@}; cf. also Laṅk 292.13 and 15, where one of the
<div n="lb">sources of abhijñā is ‘from adhiṣṭhāna’ (adhiṣṭhānān, so
<div n="lb">read in 13 for text °nāṃ, abl., before n-), which means
<div n="lb">{%from the controlling power of the Buddhas%} and is paraphrased
<div n="lb">in 15 by buddhaprasādataḥ, {%from the grace of the Buddhas%}.
<div n="lb">Suzuki, Transl. of Laṅk passim, renders {%sustaining power%};
<div n="lb">I think rather {%controlling power%}. Even Bodhisattvas are
<div n="lb">at times dependent on Buddhas and need their control;

[Page016-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">with different subjects. Bhadrottamā says to Sudhana:
