<div n="lb">could go in a hundred years by all effortful traveling
<div n="lb">(sarvasābhogavāhanatayā, i.e. by rowing etc.). So, by
<div n="lb">the knowledge of the Omniscient (sarvajñajñānena),
<div n="lb">because this knowledge is {%effortless%} (automatic, spontane-
<div n="lb">ous: jñānānābhogatayā), a Bodhisattva gets in a single
<div n="lb">moment farther than he could get in 100,000 kalpas by
<div n="lb">his former effortful activity (pūrvakeṇa sābhogakarmaṇā).
<div n="lb">Again, in Sūtrālaṃkāra ix. 18--19, a Buddha's activities
