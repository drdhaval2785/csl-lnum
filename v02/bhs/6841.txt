{@Tantrī@}¦, n. of a daughter of Māra acc. to Mv iii.281.15;
<div n="lb">283.15; 284.3; 286.6. The Mv is clearly secondary here;
<div n="lb">thruout most of the passage it mentions only two daughters
<div n="lb">of Māra, Tantrī and Arati, but in 286.6 three, the third
<div n="lb">being Rati. Originally (LV 378.4 ff.; Pali, see Childers
<div n="lb">s.v. Ragā) there were three, Tṛṣṇā, Arati, and Rati (or,
<div n="lb">in Pali, Ragā, SN i.124.15 ff.). It is clear that Mv replaces
<div n="lb">Tṛṣṇā by Tantrī. Could it be a corruption of MIndic
<div n="lb">*Taṇhī = BHS {@tṛṣṇī@}, q.v. ? Or is the corruption based
<div n="lb">on some form of the numeral for {%three%} (which is lost in
<div n="lb">Mv except in the final verse), cf. tās tisro…LV 378.4 ?
