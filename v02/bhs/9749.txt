<div n="lb">{%lumps of rice%}: na…(we will eat) Mvy 8582; corresp. to
<div n="lb">Pali sitthāvakārakaṃ, see CPD s.v. avakārakaṃ ({%‘scat-%}
<div n="lb">{%tering about’%}). This is supported in sense by Prāt 534.1
<div n="lb">which is printed śista-vikiraṃ, with note: ‘Corr. śiṣṭa’;

<div n="lb">the MIndic (Pali) sittha, or a Sktized (perh. hyper-Skt.)
