{@abhijñā@}¦ (= Pali abhiññā), {%higher or supernatural%}
<div n="lb">{%knowledge; intuition%} (CPD). There are 5 or 6, in both Pali
<div n="lb">and BHS, agreeing in essence tho the order and precise
<div n="lb">forms of the names vary. In Dharmas 20, five: divyacakṣus,
<div n="lb">divyaśrotra, paracittajñāna, pūrvanivāsānusmṛti, ṛddhi;
<div n="lb">in Mvy 201--209 six, same order, with variant forms,
<div n="lb">(parasya) {@cetaḥ-@} (citta-)-{@paryāya-@} (q.v.)-jñāna, for the
<div n="lb">third; the sixth is āśravakṣayajñāna, as in Pali and else-
<div n="lb">where when 6 are named; the fifth is ṛddhividhijñāna in
<div n="lb">Mvy 208; SP 134.11 lists 5, practically as in Dharmas
<div n="lb">except that the fifth is ṛddhivimokṣakriyā, an unusual
<div n="lb">phrase, for which no v.l. is given in KN or WT; Burnouf
<div n="lb">(Lotus App. XIV, p. 821) cites his ms. as reading ṛddhi-
<div n="lb">sākṣātkriyā, which is much more plausible. Twenty
<div n="lb">abhijñā-karmāṇi are set forth in detail Mvy 210--230.
<div n="lb">In Laṅk 292.13--16 the abhijñā, collectively, are classified
<div n="lb">as to their origin in four ways (in l. 16 read with Suzuki
