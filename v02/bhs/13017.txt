{@lumba@}¦, a kind of tree, acc. to Senart (who em. thus
<div n="lb">for mss. {@lamba@}) the {%plakṣa%}, in lumbodyānaṃ Mv i.99.6
<div n="lb">(vs), applied to what is otherwise known as the {@Lumbinī@}
<div n="lb">grove; since in line 8 {@lumbinī@} (q.v., 2) seems to be a tree-
<div n="lb">name, the em. seems plausible, tho no other record of
<div n="lb">lumba (or {@lamba@}) or lumbinī as a tree-name has been
<div n="lb">noted.
