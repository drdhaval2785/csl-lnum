{@hema-jāla@}¦ (not noted as cpd. in Skt.; Pali id., de-
<div n="lb">fined as covering for gift-elephants, gift-chariots, a heavenly
<div n="lb">mansion or vimāna and the body of a possessor of one;
<div n="lb">AMg. °jālaga, {%a kind of ornament%}, Ratnach.), lit. {%gold-net%},
<div n="lb">but seems to have acquired a special mg., which is not
<div n="lb">clear: in Mv i.171.8 (vs) one of the 60 qualities of a Buddha's
<div n="lb">voice is that it is hemajāla-tulya-ravā, {%sounding like a…%};
<div n="lb">in Mv i.195.5 the {%railing-networks%} (vedikā-jāla, see {@vedikā@})
<div n="lb">of Dīpavatī, and in 196.4 each of its city gates, are covered
<div n="lb">with two hemajāla, one of gold and the other of silver!
<div n="lb">(195.5) dvihi hemajālehi praticchannā abhūṣi suvarṇa-
<div n="lb">mayena ca °lena rūpyamayena ca; the next sentence, both
<div n="lb">times, says that the golden hemajāla had bells of silver,
<div n="lb">the silver one bells of gold; Senart supposes that hema-
<div n="lb">has come to mean {%precious substance%} in general, but I
<div n="lb">know of nothing else to support this; on the other hand,
<div n="lb">in Mv ii.453.17 the lit. mg. may well apply, elephants
<div n="lb">being described as hemajāla-praticchanna (misprinted
<div n="lb">hemalāla° in text), as in Pali AN iv. 393.21 (°saṃchanna).
