{@raṇaṃjaha@}¦, also {@raṇajaha@} m.c., ({@1@}) adj. (cf. {@raṇa@};
<div n="lb">= Pali raṇaṃjaha), primarily {%abandoning impurities%} (so
<div n="lb">Tib. usually, ñon moṅs (pa) spoṅ ba, or spaṅs ba), but
<div n="lb">in some contexts, both in Pali and BHS, apparently
<div n="lb">understood as {%victorious in battle%} (Skt. raṇa), so that
<div n="lb">Trenckner (see PTSD. s.v.) wished to em. to raṇaṃjaya;
<div n="lb">once, at least, Tib. (on LV 304.19) renders thus, gyul las
<div n="lb">rgyal; Speyer on Av ii.131 note 3 suggests {%pacifier, peace-%}
<div n="lb">{%maker%}, but this is clearly inappropriate to the contexts;
<div n="lb">nor is Seidenstücker's {%dem Kampfgewühl entronnen%} (see
<div n="lb">PTSD s.v.) any more plausible; the orig. and primary
<div n="lb">mg. seems certain in LV 358.2 (vs); 361.20 (vs, here
<div n="lb">raṇajaha, m.c.); 423.22; context tempts to assuming
<div n="lb">contamination with raṇa, {%battle%} (but it is hard for me to
<div n="lb">guess how, in that case, -jaha was interpreted) in LV
<div n="lb">304.19 (vs; on Tib. see above) śūru (nom.) balavāṃś
<div n="lb">ca raṇaṃjahaś ca; LV 437.21 (vs) śūro mahā-raṇaṃjahaḥ;
