<div n="lb">id., {%a story of a previous birth%} of the Buddha, common
<div n="lb">esp. in colophons to many such stories in Mv, e.g. i.282.13;
<div n="lb">also as n. of a work or type of literature, sometimes, at
<div n="lb">least, referring to a specific collection of such stories like
<div n="lb">the Pali Jāt.: as one of the nine (Mvy twelve) pravacana,
<div n="lb">{%gospel texts%} (Mvy dharma-pra°), Dharmas 62; Mvy 1275;
<div n="lb">in a similar list, SP 45.7; Jātake Śyāmākajātakaprabhṛtiṣu

<div n="lb">taken by Senart in sense 2 above, but I think wrongly;
<div n="lb">I believe it means {%nativity%} in the sense of (astrologically
<div n="lb">determinable) {%personality and destiny%}, as in Skt.; or
<div n="lb">possibly {%future birth%}. This seems to me indicated by
<div n="lb">adjoining parallel terms, esp. {@paramata@}, q.v., which
<div n="lb">Senart misunderstands: (bodhisattvacaritaṃ…) jātakā-
<div n="lb">paramateṣu kovidā (deśayanti…īśvarā) Mv i.104.13 (vs;
<div n="lb">kā for -ka, m.c.), {%the Lords%} (Buddhas), {%being skilled in%}

<div n="lb">prapadyanti (v.l. prayanti) 105.7; the mg., as Senart
<div n="lb">suggests, seems (from -prabhṛtikāni) to be that they
<div n="lb">{%begin%} with the 8th bhūmi; but as this passage occurs in
<div n="lb">a description of the 4th bhūmi, it is {%future%} births or
<div n="lb">destines that are meant. In i.192.19 (vs), after saṃ-
