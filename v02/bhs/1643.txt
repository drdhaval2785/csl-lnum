{@abhiṣakta@}¦, adj. (ppp. of Skt. abhi-ṣajati, Pali abhisa-
<div n="lb">jati, both {%offend, give offense to; afflict%}; cf. {@abhiṣajyate@};
<div n="lb">wrongly defined in BR s.v. sañj with abhi; Mbh. Crit. ed.
<div n="lb">3.30.26 [Nīl. tāpito, tāpayet for abhiṣakto, abhiṣajet] and
<div n="lb">4.4.9 [Rāmakṛṣṇa paraphrases using abhiṣaṅga, glossed
<div n="lb">parābhava], which are the only two passages cited in BR;
<div n="lb">pw adds one other from Caraka, abhiṣakta, defined cor-
<div n="lb">rectly {%heimgesucht%}), ({@1@}) lit. {%offended%}, hence {%angered, wrath-%}
<div n="lb">{%ful%} (so the cognate Pali abhisaṅgin is used; Pali abhisatta,
<div n="lb">in most occurrences, = Skt. abhiśapta {%cursed%}, but see
<div n="lb">below), always followed by synonyms kupita, caṇḍībhūta
<div n="lb">(or in Prāt caṇḍīkṛta): Divy 622.11; Karmav 26.5 (here
<div n="lb">krodhābhiṣakta); 27.13; Prāt 500.8; 512.9 et alibi; ({@2@}) in
<div n="lb">Mvy 2965 abhiṣaktaḥ defined by Tib. (ṅan ba) and Chin.
<div n="lb">as simply {%bad, wicked%}; the Jap. has three alternative
<div n="lb">renderings, all obviously based on etymological guesswork;
<div n="lb">one means {%vituperated%}. Occurs in a section entitled krodha-
<div n="lb">kārāḥ, and containing mostly words for {%anger, angry%} etc.,
<div n="lb">and perhaps to be interpreted precisely in this sense; in
<div n="lb">that case belonging with (1). However, Pali abhisatta-
<div n="lb">rūpa occurs once (Vv.chap. 84 vs. 5; p. 78 line 8) as ep.
<div n="lb">of bhūmippadesa, a {%region%}, described as desolate, barren
<div n="lb">wilderness; the comm. and modern interpreters take it
<div n="lb">as meaning {%accursed%}, identifying it with the usual Pali
<div n="lb">abhisatta (= °śapta, above); but the Vv.context contains
<div n="lb">no evidence for this; possibly it = Skt. abhiṣakta, orig.
<div n="lb">{%heimgesucht%} (as in Caraka, above), {%afflicted, evil%}. In that
<div n="lb">case abhiṣakta of Mvy might mean what Tib. and Chin.
<div n="lb">say, simply {%wicked%}, which would be not a difficult develop-
<div n="lb">ment from {%afflicted%}.
