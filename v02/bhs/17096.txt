{@Suyāma@}¦ (= Pali id.), n. of the head of the {@yāma@}
<div n="lb">(q.v.) gods: Suyāmadevaputrapramukhāḥ yāmā (so read
<div n="lb">with v.l. and Calc., supported by Tib., for Lefm. suyāmā)
<div n="lb">devāḥ LV 364.15; yāmādhipatiṃ…ca suyāmaṃ Mv
<div n="lb">i.265.6 (so read for Senart Va-suyāmā, v.l. ca Suyāmā);
<div n="lb">note also LV 58.21; 302.6, in both of which the official
<div n="lb">position of S. is clear from the context; apparently the
<div n="lb">same, in general clearly a single individual, lord of his
<div n="lb">class, LV 44.10; 58.21; 241.1; 441.17; (formally not clear
<div n="lb">whether sg. or pl., but surely sg., LV 50.5; 327.18; 328.3;)
<div n="lb">Mv i.208.13; 230.13; 263.19; ii.11.1; iii.315.6; Mvy 3138;
<div n="lb">Mmk 69.5 (misprinted Sayāma); Bbh 340.14; cases where
<div n="lb">Su° seems to be pluralized, as if used for the class of
<div n="lb">yāma gods as a whole, are prob. only apparent; so daśa
<div n="lb">ca Suyāma-devarāja-sahasrāṇi Gv 118.22, compare the
<div n="lb">parallel daśa ca śakra-devendra-śatasahasrāṇi 119.1
<div n="lb">(Śakra was certainly a single individual; similar phrases
<div n="lb">with Vaśavarti 117.21; Sunirmita 118.3; and Saṃtuṣita
<div n="lb">118.15); cf. Gv 185.7; similarly in Gv 249.21 Suyāma-
<div n="lb">devarāja- is followed in 22 by parallel Śakra-devarāja-
<div n="lb">(and preceded by Vaśavarti- 17, Sunirmita- 18, and Saṃ-
<div n="lb">tuṣita- 20, all names of the individual rulers of their
<div n="lb">classes); and likewise Gv 331.8. Accordingly we should
<div n="lb">interpret Suyāma patiḥ RP 52.18 and Suyāmādhipatir
<div n="lb">Dbh.g. 53(79).14 as {%Suyāma the Lord%} (of yāma gods). In
<div n="lb">the Dbh.g. passage we find, to be sure, as a parallel, trayas-
<div n="lb">triṃśādhipo bhavet 53(79).8, which can only mean {%lord%}
<div n="lb">{%of the Trayastriṃśa (class)%}; but note Saṃtuṣitādhipo 22,
<div n="lb">Sunirmitādhipo 54(80).1, and Vaśavartīśvaro ({%the Lord%}
<div n="lb">{%Vaśavartin%}) bhavet 9 (in all these adhipo, īśvaro may be
<div n="lb">separate words, not necessarily parts of cpds.!) and esp.
<div n="lb">Brahmā sāhasrikādhipaḥ 17. So in the RP context we
<div n="lb">find (52.17, vs) Brahmāpi Śakra api lokapatiḥ bhavate ca
<div n="lb">Saṃtusita devapatiḥ (may be read as separate words!),
<div n="lb">(18) Paranirmito 'pi ca Suyāma patiḥ (this may also be
<div n="lb">two words!)…
