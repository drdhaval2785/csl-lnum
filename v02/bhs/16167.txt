{@samupāhita@}¦, ppp. (cf. Skt. upāhita, {%bewirkt, hervor-%}
<div n="lb">{%gebracht%}, BR 3.911), app. {%established, festgesetzt%}, said of a
<div n="lb">proposition or statement: yathā…ācāryāṇāṃ svayaṃ
<div n="lb">°hitaṃ Mv ii.12.9 (vs), {%as is established%} (doctrine) {%of the%}
<div n="lb">{%teachers themselves%}; text reads maya = mayā after yatha
<div n="lb">for mss. yathā; if this is right, {%as I have established%} (the
<div n="lb">doctrine) {%of the teachers themselves%} (viz. that the child
<div n="lb">conceived will become either an emperor or a Buddha).
<div n="lb">The mss. here read so; in the parallel i.207.19 they are
<div n="lb">hopelessly corrupt (one intends adrākṣīt taṃ for samupā°).
<div n="lb">Senart's em. samupāhṛtaṃ (i p. 519) has no support; the
<div n="lb">SP passage he refers to (KN 476.5--6) reads parisaṃhar-
<div n="lb">ṣayiṣyāmi, with no v.l. that helps Senart. The earlier part
<div n="lb">of the line is shown by meter to be corrupt.
