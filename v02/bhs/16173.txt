<div n="lb">hetsuḥ (v.l. samuttejetsuḥ) Mv ii.125.6; I believe this
<div n="lb">would have to be an anomalous denom. to {@samūhata@},
<div n="lb">q.v., in the different meaning of {%raised%}, which is found
<div n="lb">also with {@ūhata@}, q.v.; or at least, this form, if correct,
<div n="lb">must have been influenced by that word. But it may be
<div n="lb">that we should read samūhanetsuḥ, to *samūhanati, on
<div n="lb">the basis of the Pali parallel MN i.243.23 vātā muddhānaṃ

<div n="lb">samūha, detaching it from its evident direct object śīrṣa-
