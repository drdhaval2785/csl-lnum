{@? dvipari@}¦ (-vartanāveṇī), LV 256.1. If we accept dvi-
<div n="lb">pari- with all mss. and both edd. we should have to under-
<div n="lb">stand it as part of the foll. cpd.; in that case apparently
<div n="lb">parivartanā = vartanā, and with preceding dvi- the whole
<div n="lb">might mean {%string of double beads%} (lit. {%spheres?%}), i.e.,
[Page274-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">possibly, extra-large ones? See the whole passage cited
<div n="lb">s.v. {@vartanā(veṇī)@}. Note however that the close parallel
<div n="lb">LV 254.13 lacks dvipari; and Tib. on 256.1 has nothing
<div n="lb">corresponding. Note also that the preceding comparison,
<div n="lb">ending pārśve (and cited l.c.), lacks any statement of the
<div n="lb">tertium comparationis between the Bodhisattva's sides
<div n="lb">(pārśve) and the ‘ribs’ of a crab or the roof-frame of a
<div n="lb">(ruined) stable; 254.10--11 shows the point, viz. that they
<div n="lb">were ‘open’, so that light shone thru. Is it possible that
<div n="lb">dvipari goes with the preceding and contains a corruption
<div n="lb">of some form of vi-var-(cf. vivṛtāyāṃ 254.10)? Something
<div n="lb">like opt. vivare(t), vivari? The passage is prose, and
<div n="lb">MIndic forms are not normal in prose of LV; but no one
<div n="lb">knows how MIndic its original form may have been.
