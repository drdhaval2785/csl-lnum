{@prajñāpti@}¦, f., noted only in Mvy as substitute for
<div n="lb">the usual {@prajñapti@}, q.v., cf. {@vāhana-pra°@} where in
<div n="lb">citing LV the Mvy substitutes ā for a in the word. Besides
<div n="lb">this cpd., the word occurs Mvy 1415, 6496, 9213; and see
<div n="lb">{@anu-pra°@}. Tib. on the first two gdags pa (also used for
<div n="lb">prajñā), {%making known%}, but in 9213 bcas pa (and so for
<div n="lb">anu-pra°), which is ambiguous (context suggests perhaps
<div n="lb">mg. of prajñapti 2 or 3), and on 6496 alternatively bcaḥ ba,
<div n="lb">probably intending the same; Jap. {%deciding, settling, fixing%}.
<div n="lb">(Acc. to LaV-P., Index, also occurs in AbhidhK, =
<div n="lb">prajñapti.)
