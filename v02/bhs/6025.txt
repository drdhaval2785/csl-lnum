<div n="lb">{%four-crossroads%}: so it seems that the mss. must read, or
<div n="lb">intend, at SP 88.1 (vs), where KN sthitu catvarasmin
<div n="lb">(kept by WT without note), but with note over the final
<div n="lb">letter: ‘O. care the others caresmin’. This very imperfect
<div n="lb">annotation seems to mean that the Nep. mss. have cac-
<div n="lb">caresmin (*cacaresmin or *caresmin would be unparallelled,
<div n="lb">morphologically and semantically incomprehensible, and
<div n="lb">metrically impossible); caccare, seemingly the reading of
<div n="lb">‘O’ = Kashgar rec., would be metrically defective, lacking
<div n="lb">the necessary last syllable.
