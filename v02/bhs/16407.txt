{@sarvakālaka@}¦ (see also {@sārvakālika@}), adj. with pud-
<div n="lb">gala, {%all-black, completely impure%}, said of a delinquent
<div n="lb">monk who has gone thru five rites of purification, but
<div n="lb">all wrongly done: MSV iii.74.7; 77.6. If one or more of
<div n="lb">the five rites is done properly, the others wrongly, the
<div n="lb">delinquent remains impure and is called (successively)
<div n="lb">{@yadbhūyaskālaka@}, {%mostly black%}; {@upārdhakālaka@}, {%half%}
<div n="lb">{%black%}; {@ekadeśakālaka@}; and {@pradeśakālaka@}; if all are
<div n="lb">properly done, he is {%pure%}, {@apagatakālaka@}, q.v. In the
<div n="lb">virtual repetition, p. 78, {@pradeśakālakaḥ@} is accidentally
<div n="lb">omitted, but {@ekadeśakālakaḥ@} (line 13) has the definition
<div n="lb">given above to pradeśa-k° (only one of the five rites being
<div n="lb">done wrongly), which seems likely to be right. The ms.
<div n="lb">several times writes -kālika for -kālaka.
