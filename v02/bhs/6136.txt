{@caraka@}¦, m. (not noted in Pali; rare in Skt., see pw
<div n="lb">s.v. 1 c; but recorded in AMg. as caraga-, cpd. with
<div n="lb">parivvāyaga, just as in BHS), one of a heretical sect of
<div n="lb">ascetics; regularly followed in comp. by parivrājaka, the
<div n="lb">two possibly (as allegedly in AMg., above, see Ratnach.)
<div n="lb">denoting a single sect or class of persons, rather than two:
<div n="lb">usually preceded, immediately or otherwise, by anya-
<div n="lb">tīrthika (LV 2.21; Mv iii.412.7) or anyatīrthya (SP 276.2);
<div n="lb">caraka-parivrājaka- LV 2.21; 380.12; SP 276.2; Mv
<div n="lb">iii.412.7; Śikṣ 331.11. The proper Tib. translation seems
<div n="lb">to be spyod pa pa; so both LV passages (Foucaux reads
<div n="lb">dpyod pa pa for 2.21, but my photostat of the Lib. of
<div n="lb">Congr. ed. spyod…) and SP; spyod = car-. But Jäschke
<div n="lb">defines this by Mīmāṃsaka, the correct term for which
<div n="lb">is dpyod pa pa (both terms are given for Mīmāṃsaka in
<div n="lb">Mvy 3517; Mvy seems to omit caraka); dpyod = {%examine%}
<div n="lb">(mīmāṃs-); Tib. tradition has confused the two.
