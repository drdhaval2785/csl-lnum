{@Utkarika@}¦, n. of a merchant: Divy 227.26 tatrānya-
<div n="lb">taraś cotkariko nāma baṇig…Cf. {@Otkarika@} (the same
<div n="lb">person as Utk°). There seems to be no reason to connect
<div n="lb">this n. pr. with aukarika (okkarika), qq.v., as has been
<div n="lb">assumed by Feer, Speyer (on Av, Index, s.v. okkarika)
<div n="lb">and Cowell and Neil (Index to Divy). But perhaps we
<div n="lb">should read cautk° in 227.26 and assume Otk° as the name.
