<div n="lb">of human corpses in various states of disintegration; there
<div n="lb">are nine (in Pali, Vism. i.110.29--31 ten) such monkish
<div n="lb">disciplines, elsewhere called simply nava saṃjñāh, {%the%}

<div n="lb">less schematized passage of the same sort in older Pali,
<div n="lb">MN i.58.9 ff. In Mvy 1156--64 they are listed, each cpd.
<div n="lb">with -saṃjñā: (1) {@vinīlaka-@}, (2) {@vipūyaka-@} (so read),

<div n="lb">except that it transposes Nos. 5 and 6 and accidentally
<div n="lb">omits 8 (which perhaps should be put after 9; only Mvy
<div n="lb">has it before 9). There are three lists (one incomplete,
[Page080-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">one very corrupt) in ŚsP 59.1 ff., 1258.5 ff., 1431.19 ff.
<div n="lb">(six items only; cited from the last, with only four items
<div n="lb">one of which is not in this ŚsP list, in Śikṣ 211.1). Barring
<div n="lb">corruptions, the ŚsP lists agree with Mvy and Bhīk ex-
<div n="lb">cept in order of the terms, in which they show some
<div n="lb">(slight) resemblance to the Pali (Vism.) arrangement.
