{@śikṣāpada@}¦, nt. (Skt. in Harṣac.; = Pali sikkhāpada,
<div n="lb">see also {@śiṣyā°@}), {%moral commandment%}; as in Pali, there
<div n="lb">are five incumbent on all Buddhists, referred to as binding
<div n="lb">on an upāsaka and listed Mv iii.268.10--13, in the form
<div n="lb">of promises made, yāvajjīvaṃ prāṇātipātāt (adattādānāt,
<div n="lb">kāmehi mithyācārāt, mṛṣāvādāt, surāmaireyamadyapra-
<div n="lb">mādasthānāt) prativiramiṣyaṃ; the second five bind only
<div n="lb">monks, śrāmaṇerasya śikṣāpadaṃ iii.268.16--17, here not
<div n="lb">listed but referred to, yāvaj (this means that the first
<div n="lb">four are understood) jātarūparajatapratigrahaṇa-śikṣāpa-

<div n="lb">gītavāditā, which is separate in the Pali list but grouped
<div n="lb">with gandhamālyavilepana in AbhidhK. LaV-P. iv.47,
<div n="lb">altho this text proceeds to point out that the standard
<div n="lb">number ten is made up by separating these two (and adding
<div n="lb">the prohibition against gold etc., which curiously, in
<div n="lb">AbhidhK. as in Mvy, is left out of the formal list of eight);
<div n="lb">the order of the second group of five varies slightly in
<div n="lb">different lists; pañca śi° Mv i.211.14 = ii.15.13 (observed
<div n="lb">by the Bodhisattva's mother while carrying him); i.321.18;
