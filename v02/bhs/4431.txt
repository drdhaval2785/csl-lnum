{@kapāṭa@}¦, in LV 376.13 (vs), to be read approximately:
<div n="lb">nīvaraṇa-kapāṭāś ca pañca mayehā pradāritā sarve, perh.
<div n="lb">{%all the five doors%} (gates, as obstacles) {%of the hindrances have%}
<div n="lb">{%been cleft by me here%}. Note however that AMg. kavāḍa =
<div n="lb">kapāṭa is a homonym of kavāḍa = kapāla; I suspect that
<div n="lb">the latter is really meant here (falsely Sktized), in some
<div n="lb">such sense as {%hard shells%}.
