<div n="lb">tarikā, subst., not adj., ‘scil. Niraya’, with PTSD), {%inter-%}
<div n="lb">{%stice(s) between the worlds%}; they are dark, gloomy places,
<div n="lb">a kind of purgatories: chiefly in a well-known cliché,
<div n="lb">recorded SP 163.8; LV 51.10; 410.13 (and the first part,
<div n="lb">ending andhakārās, as abbreviation, 351.22--352.1); Mv
<div n="lb">i.41.4; 229.20; 240.9; ii.162.9; iii.334.7; 341.12; Divy
<div n="lb">204.22; 205.4, 13, 23; 206.5, 16; Samādh page 7 line 9;
<div n="lb">ŚsP 102.17 (abbreviated); and in Pali, DN ii.12.10; MN
<div n="lb">iii.120.9; AN ii.130.24; SN v.454.16. There are minor
<div n="lb">variants thruout, not all reported here, and in Mv the
<div n="lb">mss. are mostly quite corrupt and vary widely; Senart
<div n="lb">em. rashly; I shall quote a blended version which seems
<div n="lb">at least close to a common Mv text. For convenience the
<div n="lb">passage is divided into sections, (a) to (g); Divy lacks (b)
<div n="lb">and (f); ŚsP lacks (a) and (g); in Samādh, (b) is lacking,
<div n="lb">(a) and (c) come after (f); in Mv (all six passages) and
<div n="lb">in ŚsP, (b) comes after (c): (a) om. ŚsP; yā (a)pi tā (Divy
<div n="lb">adds lokasya; 204.22 lacks api tā, and so also SP; 3 of
<div n="lb">6 Mv passages add loke) lokāntarikā (Pali lokant°); (b)
<div n="lb">omitted in Divy, Samādh, and prob. corrupt in all; I
<div n="lb">believe orig. had aghā aghasaṃvṛtā (Pali aghā asaṃvutā,
<div n="lb">for which Senart, Mv i.406, brilliantly conjectured aghā
<div n="lb">aghasaṃvutā; the Pali comms. seem to me fatuous, and
<div n="lb">I cannot feel attracted by CPD's interpretation of aghā,
<div n="lb">see s.v. {@agha@}; Mv supports Senart, and so in a measure
<div n="lb">do SP, LV and ŚsP); the Mv tradition seems to point to
<div n="lb">aghā aghasaṃbhūtapūrvā, in which with Senart I regard
<div n="lb">saṃbhūta as a corruption for saṃvṛta, or MIndic saṃ-
<div n="lb">vuta; close in sense, also, is aghā aghasphuṭā ({%full of%}
<div n="lb">{%misery%}), the reading of LV and ŚsP (in ŚsP after c);
<div n="lb">finally, SP, tho substituting (tāsu ya) akṣaṇāḥ for the first
<div n="lb">aghā, and omitting the 2d agha-, actually preserves saṃ-
<div n="lb">vṛtā(ḥ), alone among BHS texts (note that it has no
<div n="lb">negative! thus tending to show the corruption of the
<div n="lb">Pali); (c) andhakārā andhakāratamisrā(ḥ) (Pali andhakārā
<div n="lb">andhakāratimisā); so Samādh; SP ed. omits andhakārā
<div n="lb">(haplogr.), but v.l. has it; either it or andhakāra- is
<div n="lb">omitted in ŚsP and both LV versions (haplogr.); Divy
