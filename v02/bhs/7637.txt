{@dviruttarapadasaṃdhi-lipi@}¦, a kind of writing: LV
<div n="lb">126.8; Tib. tshig lan lan gñis su gdab paḥi tshig gi mtshams
<div n="lb">kyi (yi ge), which Foucaux renders, {%(écriture) du saṃdhi%}
<div n="lb">{%(liaison) d'un mot répété deux fois%}, which does not make
<div n="lb">much sense to me, nor can I see how it renders the Tib.
<div n="lb">(which however I find obscure). The text continues: yāvad-
<div n="lb">daśottarapadasaṃdhi-lipiṃ; this time Tib. is rather dif-
<div n="lb">ferent, tshig gi mtshams bcur brgyud paḥi bar gyi (yi ge),
<div n="lb">which Foucaux renders as before (with {%ten%} for {%two%}); it
<div n="lb">seems to mean {%writing up to a series of ten%} (forming) {%a%}
<div n="lb">{%combination of words%}, or {%writing of combinations of words%}
<div n="lb">{%in which up to ten words follow one another%}. Possibly dvirut-
<div n="lb">tara° means no more than {%writing of two words in com-%}
<div n="lb">{%bination%}.
