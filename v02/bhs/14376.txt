[{@vīramaṇī@}¦ is cited PTSD s.v. veramaṇī as a BHS
<div n="lb">form for the latter, see {@vairamaṇa, °ṇya@}. But the only
<div n="lb">passage quoted is Jm 213(.7), where the text reads vīra-
<div n="lb">mānī, which has nothing to do with Pali veramaṇī. If
<div n="lb">vīramaṇī exists in BHS I have failed to note it.]
