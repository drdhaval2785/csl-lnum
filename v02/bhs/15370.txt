<div n="lb">baggiya), {%members of the group of six (monks)%}, see Childers
<div n="lb">and PTSD: Mvy 9255 = Tib. drug sde. Their names are
<div n="lb">given 9471--6: Nanda, Upananda, Punarvasu, Chanda,
<div n="lb">Aśvaka, Udāyin; the Pali list agrees only in part. Nanda
<div n="lb">and Upananda also belong to this group in Divy; see s.v.
<div n="lb">{@Nandopananda@}. In Pali they seem to be represented as
<div n="lb">followers of the Buddha, though very imperfect ones,
<div n="lb">often transgressing rules of propriety. In BHS, at least
<div n="lb">in Divy, they seem to be heretics from the Buddhist
<div n="lb">standpoint.
