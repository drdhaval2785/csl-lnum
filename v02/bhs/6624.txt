{@jina-śrāvaka@}¦, {%pupil of a jina%}, applied in Mv ii.118.2,
<div n="lb">3 to the pupils of Ārāḍa Kālāma, and in ii.119.9, 10 to
<div n="lb">those of Udraka Rāmaputra. Senart assumes that this
<div n="lb">means that these teachers were Jains. But in default
<div n="lb">of any other evidence this seems unlikely; jina is of course
<div n="lb">also a title of a Buddha, and we may infer from this that
<div n="lb">it could be applied to the founder of any religious sect.
