[{@ura(s)@}¦, {%womb?%} So acc. to Senart on Mv i.199.10 =
<div n="lb">ii.3.8 (vs), ed. divasāni sapta māsā ca daśa tasyā uram
<div n="lb">otaret. The meter is bad even so; mss. in i.199.10 read
<div n="lb">udare-m-, which suggests a form of udara, the word we
<div n="lb">should expect; I find no record of ura(s) in the required
<div n="lb">mg. Perhaps the orig. had something like…daśa tasyodar’
<div n="lb">(for tasyā udaram or udare) otaret.]
