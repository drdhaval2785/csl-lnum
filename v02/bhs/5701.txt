{@gahana@}¦ (nt., or adj.), is sometimes, apparently, in-
<div n="lb">volved in word-plays with {@grahaṇa@}, q.v. (on the basis of
<div n="lb">MIndic pronunciation of the latter). In Śikṣ 286.1 (aśaṭhatā
<div n="lb">śaṭheṣu,) amāyāvitā gahanacariteṣu (this is the clear
<div n="lb">intention of the ms., see ed. note, and must be read),
<div n="lb">kṛtajñatā akṛtajñeṣu, etc., the Tib. is said to render
<div n="lb">{%guilelessness among the guileful%}, which is supported by the
<div n="lb">parallel phrases surrounding this. The transl. of Bendall
<div n="lb">and Rouse renders gahana-carita {%overreaching%}; it seems
<div n="lb">more likely to mean {%of obscure, hidden%} (or perhaps {%tangled%})
<div n="lb">{%conduct%}, and so {%tricky%}. See next (apparently a quite un-
<div n="lb">related confusion).
