{@Kauśika, (1)@}¦ (presumably = Skt. id. as gotra-name),
<div n="lb">n. of a brahmanical gotra: Mv ii.48.16 ff., and of an
<div n="lb">ascetic belonging to it, ii.49.3 ff.; in ii.63.18 he is called
<div n="lb">{@Nārada@} by personal name, which is due to a confusion
<div n="lb">in the story, the true form of which is told in Pali, Jāt.
<div n="lb">535, where the ascetic is called (Macchari-)Kosiya (Kosika),
<div n="lb">and Nārada (= Skt. id.) appears as a quite different
<div n="lb">character; many vss of the Jāt. are paralleled in Mv,
<div n="lb">including one giving (in Mv, not in the Jāt.) the name
<div n="lb">Nārada, apparently, to the ascetic (Mv ii.55.3 = Jāt.
<div n="lb">v.395.12); ({@2@}) n. of a disciple of Śākyamuni, to be read in
<div n="lb">LV 1.16 instead of {@Kasphila@}, q.v., as proved by Tib.

<div n="lb">DPPN; ({@3@}) n. of a locality: Māy 81; see Lévi, p. 101,
