{@? busaplāvī@}¦, acc. sg. °vīm, something disagreeable
<div n="lb">(hard, or foul, offensive) to eat; parallel with ayoguḍa,
<div n="lb">svamāṃsa, pūyaśoṇita: Divy 12.25; 13.17; all things
<div n="lb">which niggards wished a mendicant should eat, and which
<div n="lb">later they were therefore obliged to eat themselves. The
<div n="lb">Index renders {%beetle%} (?); I do not know why. The first
<div n="lb">member seems to be Skt. busa, {%chaff, refuse, rubbish%}; perh.
<div n="lb">the ed. of Divy understood the latter part as {%leaping%} ({%in%}
<div n="lb">{%chaff%} of grain; even this need not lead to the mg. {%beetle%}).
<div n="lb">Same passage MSV iv.176.7; 177.11; Tib. cited as phub
<div n="lb">ma, {%chaff%} (= busa), for the entire word.
