{@samudita@}¦, in ālaya-samudita Mv iii.314.3, 4, see
<div n="lb">s.v. {@ālaya@} (2): {%taking delight in%} is certainly the mg. It
<div n="lb">is natural to think of em. to saṃmudita; but the corresp.
<div n="lb">Pali has in SN i.136.12 and 13 samudita, and this is a
<div n="lb">v.l. for saṃmudita of text in another parallel Vin. i.4.36 f.
<div n="lb">On the other hand, we find in Pali similar triple formulas
<div n="lb">containing -ārāma, -rata, and -saṃmudita in MN i.503.22;
<div n="lb">SN iv.389.10; 390.1--2. PTSD recognizes samudita, {%excited%}
<div n="lb">(allegedly from sam-ud-i, {%‘aroused’%}), as well as saṃmudita
<div n="lb">{%delighted%}, and Childers cites, without reference, samudi-
<div n="lb">tamano ({%elevated, excited%}) udaggamano attamano, where
<div n="lb">the meaning seems clearly {%rejoiced%}. I have failed to note
<div n="lb">saṃmudita in BHS, or any other occurrence of samudita
<div n="lb">in this sense. Surely one of the two words is an ancient
<div n="lb">corruption of the other.
