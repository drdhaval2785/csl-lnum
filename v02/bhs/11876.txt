{@mahāśrāvaka@}¦ (= Pali mahāsāvaka), {%important%}
<div n="lb">{%disciple%} (of Buddha). In general BHS, like Pali, knows
<div n="lb">no definite number or list of them (Vism. 98.26 speaks of
<div n="lb">the number 80); a typical list of 26 names in SP 1.9 ff.,
<div n="lb">but at the end it adds, ‘and others’; no number given in
<div n="lb">SP 33.5; 121.1; LV 6.15; Divy 489.11, etc. Only Mmk
<div n="lb">makes tentative starts at lists; twice it mentions groups
<div n="lb">of eight: Mmk 64.9 ff. Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana,
<div n="lb">Mahākāśyapa, Subhūti, Rāhula, Nanda, Bhadrika, Kaphi-
<div n="lb">ṇa; but 111.11 ff. varies (1--2 = 2--1 of 64.9 ff.; then
<div n="lb">Gavāṃpati, Piṇḍola-Bharadvāja, Pilindavatsa, 6 = 5
<div n="lb">above, 7 = 3 above, and 8 Ānanda, who in SP 2.8 is a
<div n="lb">mere śaikṣa, excluded from the mahāśrāvaka group);
<div n="lb">in Mmk 40.25 Mahākāśyapa and Mahākātyāyana con-
<div n="lb">stitute a pair of mahāśr°; in 13.22 ff. is a very long list,
<div n="lb">including some familiar and many fanciful and textually
<div n="lb">doubtful ones; the same is true of the list of females,
<div n="lb">mahāśrāvikā, which follows in 14.19 ff. (beginning with
<div n="lb">Yaśodharā); the names in both these lists are omitted
<div n="lb">here as being largely unreliable.
