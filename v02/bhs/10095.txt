{@prativāṇi, °ṇī@}¦, f. (and {@°ṇi@}, nt.?; cf. {@a-prati°@}, which
<div n="lb">see for Pali correspondents), {%opposition, repulsion, aversion%}
<div n="lb">to spoken words, especially to preaching or teaching;
<div n="lb">apparently a cpd. of prati and vāṇī: °ṇī, n. sg., AsP 244.20,
<div n="lb">and °ṇiḥ, id., 484.7, both in reference to preaching or
<div n="lb">teaching; prativāṇi (? Mironov °ni without v.l., and Kyoto
<div n="lb">ed. suggests that their mss. read °ni, and that their °ṇi
<div n="lb">in text is an em.; cf. however aprativāṇi, where both edd.
<div n="lb">have °ṇi) Mvy 5239 = Tib. mi ḥphrod pa, {%unsuitable,%}
<div n="lb">{%disagreeable%} or the like; prob. of attitude towards teaching
<div n="lb">(the preceding entry is śaikṣābhir nikūjitaṃ). Form dubi-
<div n="lb">ous; ending seems confirmed by aprativāṇi; n. sg. nt.?
<div n="lb">Or possibly adverb? In pw 7.360 °vāṇi by em., rendered
<div n="lb">{%Opposition%}, which I think is about right.
