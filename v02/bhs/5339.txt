[{@kṣaṇā@}¦, f., acc. to Divy 643.2, = Skt. kṣaṇa, of a
<div n="lb">definite unit of time; but in line 3 the word is nt., kṣaṇāny;
<div n="lb">and in the parallel 644.11 it seems to have been recorded
<div n="lb">first as m., kṣaṇaḥ (mss. however are corrupt), then nt.,
<div n="lb">as in 643.3. See the passages, s.v. {@tatkṣaṇa@}. Prob. the
<div n="lb">fem. kṣaṇā is a mere corruption.]
