{@? drāva@}¦, nt. (vv.11. drāṣa, naṣa), some part of the
<div n="lb">body, in a passage (vss, tho printed as prose) identifying
<div n="lb">various bodily parts with features of the outside world:
<div n="lb">(sāgaraś cāpy amedhyaṃ vai) drāvaṃ Brahmā Prajāpatiḥ
<div n="lb">Divy 628.29. I have no idea what is intended; but sarvaṃ,
<div n="lb">conjectured in note, seems implausible.
