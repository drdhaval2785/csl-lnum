<div n="lb">{%holding back%} (from giving): SP 257.1 (after long description
<div n="lb">of how the Bodhisattva gave away everything, even his

<div n="lb">{%never conceived a thought of holding back%} (wrongly Burnouf

<div n="lb">{%thought of holding back%} (from giving). As Speyer points
<div n="lb">out in his Index to Av, KSS 90.22 probably contains the
<div n="lb">word āgraheṇa {%with niggardliness, holding back from giving%};
<div n="lb">but this mg. has not been recognized; the ordinary Skt.
<div n="lb">usage is not quite the same.
