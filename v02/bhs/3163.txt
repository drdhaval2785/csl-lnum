<div n="lb">I find no basis for the theory. All the context shows is
<div n="lb">that persons dressed in these garbs should not be con-
<div n="lb">secrated (dīkṣ). What the {%garb of Indra (? of a prince)%}
<div n="lb">means is not clear. It is true that śveta-paṭa is recorded
<div n="lb">as used of the Jain sect otherwise called śvetāmbara;
<div n="lb">doubtless this was the reason for Boehtlingk's conjecture,
<div n="lb">based on the assumption that this word equals digambara;
<div n="lb">but I doubt that this is sufficient to support it. That
<div n="lb">a real sort of cloth is meant is suggested by nānā-paṭeṣu,
