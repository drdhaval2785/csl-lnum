[? {@jāhu@}¦, in RP 58.18 (vs), printed: dūre jāhu bhujaga-
<div n="lb">vad etān (sc. evil companions). Since it is scarcely possible
<div n="lb">that the Vedic verb aj-, {%drive%} (away), is concerned ('jā
<div n="lb">= aja, hu = khalu, {%drive them away like serpents!%}), I
<div n="lb">believe that some form of hā, {%abandon%} (less likely of han,
<div n="lb">{%smite%}) must be involved; the ā might well be m.c. (meter
<div n="lb">requires two long syllables), but I cannot explain the
<div n="lb">final u (ū ?). Perhaps read jāhā = jaha, 2 sg. impv.,
<div n="lb">{%abandon!%} (?)]
