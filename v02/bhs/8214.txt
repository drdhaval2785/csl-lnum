{@nikṛnta@}¦ (also nikṛntana? prob. only by error) adj.
<div n="lb">(= Pali nikanta, MN i.364.17), {%cut off%}; common in Divy
<div n="lb">and Av in mūla-ni°, {%cut off at the roots%}; mss. regularly
<div n="lb">read so; in Divy 539.5 they read °nikṛntana, which
<div n="lb">ed. em. °nikṛntita; otherwise edd. of both texts al-
<div n="lb">ways em. to nikṛtta, but the Pali word supports the
<div n="lb">reading of the mss. It is doubtless derived in some way
<div n="lb">from kṛntati, but the precise process is obscure to me:
<div n="lb">Divy 192.9; 313.15; 362.17; 387.6; 400.17; 425.5; 539.5
<div n="lb">(see above); 583.15 (in 537.14 occurs nikṛntita-mūlaṃ);
<div n="lb">Av i.3.16 (one ms. here nikṛta, v.l. nikṛnta); 9.12; 24.11;
<div n="lb">37.12; 51.2, etc.
