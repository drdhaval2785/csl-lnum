[{@kārīṣi?@}¦ form and mg. doubtful, in refrain pāda:
<div n="lb">kārīṣi (so the mss. seem clearly to indicate; sometimes they
<div n="lb">read °ṣu, and other vv.ll.) dattvā jinacetiyeṣu Mv ii.384.17,
<div n="lb">repeated 21, 385.3, 7, 11, 19, 23. A parallel vs occurring
<div n="lb">in the midst of these, 385.15, has (na) tailavinduṃ jina-
<div n="lb">stūpe dattvā; and in a following vs 386.1 tailasya vinduṃ
<div n="lb">jinacetiyeṣu occurs. This suggests that possibly tālīśa (°śu,
<div n="lb">for °śaṃ?) should be read, = Pali tālīsa, tālissa, {%a ‘powder%}
<div n="lb">{%or ointment’%} (PTSD) made from the plant named in Skt.
<div n="lb">tālīśa; {@tālīśa@} occurs, perhaps in this mg. (associated with
<div n="lb">tailam), in Mvy 5787, see s.v. It seems at any rate appro-
<div n="lb">priate; some oily substance used in decorating a caitya is
<div n="lb">indicated.]
