{@-avakrāntaka@}¦, also {@°ika@}, f. °ikā, only in tīrthikāv°,
<div n="lb">{%one who has gone over to heretics, a renegade Buddhist%}:
<div n="lb">Mvy 8759 °takaḥ; Bhīk 16b.2 °tikā. The corresp. Pali,
<div n="lb">Vin. i.89.35, has titthiya-pakkantaka, apparently =
<div n="lb">prakrānta(ka); but I suspect that the true original of
<div n="lb">both this and avakr° was *apakrāntaka; Pali apakkamati
<div n="lb">and apakkanta are used in mgs. very close to this, and
<div n="lb">neither ava-nor pra-kram- seems so appropriate.
