{@diśi@}¦ (= AMg. disi, for Skt. diś, diśā; not in Pali),
<div n="lb">{%direction%}. Noted only in Mmk, but not rare there; usually
<div n="lb">acc. sg. diśim; sometimes (notably 205.26, where it seems
<div n="lb">clearly to be taken so, § 4.59, end) this could be interpreted
<div n="lb">as loc. diśi plus ‘hiatus-bridging’ m; among the cases
<div n="lb">which are certainly acc. are: dakṣiṇāṃ diśim āśritāḥ
<div n="lb">Mmk 326.18, and…āśritya 626.26; prāciṃ (°cīṃ) diśim
<div n="lb">upādāya 620.1 (these all vss). The great corruption of the
<div n="lb">text of Mmk might tempt to emendation (diśam would be
<div n="lb">easy), but AMg. seems to confirm the form.
