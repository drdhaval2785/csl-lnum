<div n="lb">{%charioteer (driver, tamer, controller) of human ones-that-need-%}
<div n="lb">{%to-be-tamed%} (= {%trained%} religiously; as Vism. indicates,
<div n="lb">dam = vi-nī, {%discipline%}); the figure clearly refers to taming
<div n="lb">animals, particularly horses, and indeed is no doubt
<div n="lb">directly based on Pali assa-damma-sārathi, q.v. in CPD;
<div n="lb">cf. such expressions as puruṣājāneya (see s.v. {@ājāneya@}),
<div n="lb">{%noble steed of a man%}. Ep. of a Buddha, or a Bodhisattva
<div n="lb">just before his attainment of Buddhahood. Often misunder-
<div n="lb">stood; further evidence supporting the interpretation here
<div n="lb">given will be found below. Tib. (on Mvy 10, LV 3.4 etc.)

<div n="lb">evidently meant as a much stronger variant of the usual
<div n="lb">term, but incidentally confirms our interpretation of the
<div n="lb">latter; so also does the epithet puruṣadamyasārathinā in
<div n="lb">another formulaic series of epithets applied to the Bo-
<div n="lb">dhisattva just before his enlightenment, in which several
