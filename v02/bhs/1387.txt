{@a-prativartiya@}¦ (semi-MIndic for °tya; = Pali ap-
<div n="lb">paṭivattiya), {%not to be turned back%} (by any creature; said
<div n="lb">of the dharmacakra, once set in motion by a Buddha):
<div n="lb">Mv iii.327.7 (vs, no v.l.); in Mv i.330.4 (prose) doubtless
[Page048-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">read so with 1 ms., the other pravartayaṃ, Senart em.
<div n="lb">apravartiyaṃ; in Mv i.331.4 Senart with mss. apravartiyaṃ,
<div n="lb">in 332.7 apravartitaṃ, which is read in the same formula
<div n="lb">SP 179.1 (prose, no v.l.); in Mv i.332.21 aparivartitaṃ,
<div n="lb">in 333.12 apravartiyaṃ, v.l. aparivartiya. In Pali ap-
<div n="lb">parently only appaṭi° occurs, and I believe this must
<div n="lb">have been the original reading. No being could {%turn back%}
<div n="lb">the wheel started by the Buddha. But evidently in BHS
<div n="lb">tradition this became confused with forms (ppp. as well
<div n="lb">as gdve.) of pra-, pari-vṛt-, which of course also yield
<div n="lb">a tolerable sense: {%which had never been set in motion%} or
<div n="lb">{%could not be set in motion%} by any (other) being.
