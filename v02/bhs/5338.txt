{@kṣaṇa@}¦, m. (= Pali khaṇa), {%birth under favorable%}
<div n="lb">{%conditions%}. There are 8 {@akṣaṇa@} (q.v.) but only 1 kṣaṇa,
<div n="lb">viz., birth as a man in the ‘middle region’, where a Buddha
<div n="lb">is to be expected, at a time when he is born, and with the
<div n="lb">mental capacity to assimilate his doctrine (Pali AN iv.227.8
<div n="lb">ff.): Mv ii.363.4 kṣaṇaṃ (acc.) ekaṃ buddhotpādaṃ suśo-
<div n="lb">bhanam; Suv 41.(13--)14(--15) (bhavantu aṣṭākṣaṇavīti-

<div n="lb">{%favorable birth%}) uttamaṃ, (labhantu buddhehi samāgamaṃ
<div n="lb">sadā); Śikṣ 2.4; 114.15 kṣaṇasampad, {%the good luck of%}

<div n="lb">Senart kṣaṇāṃś ca, but keep kṣaṇāc ca with mss., {%and%}
<div n="lb">{%instantly%}.) Once, however, kṣaṇa in this sense seems to be
[Page198-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">pluralized: Mv ii.392.5--6 so akṣaṇāni parivarjayitvā,
<div n="lb">kṣaṇā ca tasya bhavanti viśiṣṭā (but mss. bhavati viśiṣṭo,
<div n="lb">taking kṣaṇā as n. sg., § 8.24); the same vs Śikṣ 306.1
<div n="lb">even makes 8 kṣaṇa, obviously as mechanical pendant
<div n="lb">to the 8 akṣaṇa; so akṣaṇaṃ vai vijahāti sarvaṃ, aṣṭakṣa-
<div n="lb">ṇāś cāsya viśiṣṭa bhonti.This is a secondary distortion.

<div n="lb">{%of unfavorable births in the cities of asuras and gods%}; evidently
<div n="lb">both kṣaṇa and akṣaṇa (the latter includes birth as a god!)
<div n="lb">are used in their standard meanings; but here the use of
<div n="lb">kṣaṇa is not strictly logical, since the Bodhisattva himself
<div n="lb">is speaking! [In Divy 76.25; 465.23 read {@kṣūṇa@}, q.v.]
