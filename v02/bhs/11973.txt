{@mātrī@}¦, adj. f. (to m. *mātra, from Skt. mātṛ plus
<div n="lb">a?), {%of the mother, maternal%}: (svaka-svakā yeva) mātrīyo
<div n="lb">bhaginīyo parasparasya vivāhitā Mv i.351.4, (the princes)
<div n="lb">{%gave to each other in marriage each their own sisters by the%}
<div n="lb">{%same mother%} (thus avoiding the marriage of any with his
<div n="lb">co-uterine sister). So the Tib. version cited by Senart
<div n="lb">p. 625; Senart misunderstands the Skt. text; he reads
<div n="lb">mātṛyo with v.l. (and with both mss. line 8 below), but
<div n="lb">this can only be a corruption. The Pali adj. mātiya which
<div n="lb">he cites is not known to PTSD; Childers cites it with
<div n="lb">no textual reference; even if a genuine Pali word, it can
<div n="lb">hardly be concerned here.
