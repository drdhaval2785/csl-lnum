{@mānatva@}¦, nt. (also {@mānāpya@}, q.v.; = Pali mānatta),
<div n="lb">a kind of penance which is superimposed, after {@parivāsa@},
<div n="lb">on a monk guilty of a saṃghāvaśeṣa offense which he has
<div n="lb">concealed: Prāt 487.11--12 bhikṣuṇā…mānatvaṃ (12)
<div n="lb">caritavyaṃ bhavati, cīrṇa-mānatvo ({%after he has undergone%}
<div n="lb">{%the m°%}) bhikṣur…; for {@mānāpya@}, Mvy 8652--5, v.l.
<div n="lb">mānatva (so Index; ed. mānātva), but Mironov mānāpya
<div n="lb">without v.l.; Tib. renders Mvy mgu bar bya ba, {%making%}
<div n="lb">{%glad%} (Das = ārādhanā); Chin. {%respectful behavior%}; this
<div n="lb">accords with the Pali comm. (629.29) on the Vin. passage
<div n="lb">(iii.186.15 f., bhikkhunā…bhikkhu-mānattāya paṭi-
<div n="lb">pajjitabbaṃ, ciṇṇamānatto bhikkhu…) corresponding to
<div n="lb">Prāt 487.11--12 above; the comm. says, bhikkhu-mānattāyā
<div n="lb">ti bhikkhūnaṃ mānanabhāvāya, ārādhanatthāyā (cf. Das
<div n="lb">on Tib. above) ti vuttaṃ hoti; it thus appears that,
<div n="lb">according to both northern and southern tradition, this
<div n="lb">penance consisted in, or at least involved, some kind of
<div n="lb">ceremonial homage paid by the culprit to the general
<div n="lb">community of monks. This can be interpreted as supporting
<div n="lb">the apparent etym., māna-tva, {%condition of%} (paying) {%respect%}.
