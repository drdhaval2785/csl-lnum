{@Yaśodeva, (1)@}¦ n. of a disciple of Buddha: LV 1.8
<div n="lb">(no v.l.). Evidently corresponds to Pali Yasa (Thera, 1
<div n="lb">in DPPN; cf. {@Yaśas@} 1, {@Yaśoda@}), of Vin. i.15.1 ff., as is
<div n="lb">shown by the next four names in LV, Vimala, Subāhu,
<div n="lb">Pūrṇa, and Gavāṃpati, who correspond to the four friends
<div n="lb">of Yasa named in Vin. i.18.36 f., Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji,
<div n="lb">and Gavampati. So also Sukh 2.3, followed by Vimala,
<div n="lb">Subāhu, and Pūrṇa (Maitrāyaṇīputra). ({@2@}) n. of an upāsaka
<div n="lb">or lay-disciple, surely not the same as 1: Gv 51.10.
