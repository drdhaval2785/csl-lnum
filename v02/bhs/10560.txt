<div n="lb">(prose) samyakprahāṇa-(see {@prahāṇa@})-prasaṭhā (so divide)
<div n="lb">ri-(lacuna; Tib. rdzu ḥphrul = ṛddhi-); Tib. renders
<div n="lb">prasaṭhā by ḥgro ba, here doubtless {%entrance into…%}; the
<div n="lb">syllable ṭhā seems corrupt but I think of no attractive em.
<div n="lb">Dubious also is praśaṭhatā Mvy 2101 (both edd., no v.l.),
<div n="lb">which looks as if it meant {%trickery, deceitfulness%} (so pw
<div n="lb">7.362; cf. AMg. pasaḍha, {%rogue, trickster%}); but Tib. renders
<div n="lb">rnal du ({%into tranquillity%}) (ḥ)bab ({%entrance into%}) or ḥdug
<div n="lb">pa ({%state of%}), which suggests a form of śam (cf. {@śamatha@});

<div n="lb">resulting in tranquillity (the last phrase not in Chin. here
<div n="lb">but cited from a parallel passage).
