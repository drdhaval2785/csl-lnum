{@āhāraka@}¦, m., in Mvy 3851, acc. to Tib. sñod ciṅ
<div n="lb">stobs pa, which seems to mean someone concerned with
<div n="lb">food; so also Chin. Prob. this is etymological guesswork
<div n="lb">(Skt. āhāra). Certainly it refers to some member of a ship's
<div n="lb">crew; see {@āhāra, āharaṇa@}; perhaps {%one who tows%} (or
<div n="lb">otherwise propels?) {%a boat%}, as in Pali āharitvā (nāvaṃ)
<div n="lb">Jāt. iv.159.16.
