{@? kiṭika@}¦, m. or nt.: Divy 374.7 (prose) pañcastrīśatāni
<div n="lb">kiṭikaiḥ saṃveṣṭya dagdhāni.(Burnouf, Intr. 365 note 1,
<div n="lb">conjectures kāṣṭ[h]akaiḥ, implausibly.) Perhaps same
<div n="lb">word as Pali kiṭaka, in Pv. i.9.2 and 4, something (acc.
<div n="lb">to comm. [hot] {%copper plates%}) into which the {%clothing%} of
<div n="lb">the petas is changed; thus it fits the Divy passage. There
<div n="lb">is also a Pali kiṭika, Vin. ii.152.26 and 153.5, perhaps
<div n="lb">also some sort of {%covering%}, but very obscure; comm. re-
<div n="lb">peats it without glossing.
