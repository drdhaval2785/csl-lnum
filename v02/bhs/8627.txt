{@nītārtha@}¦, adj. (cf. BR s.v. nī, 12, {%establish, determine%};
<div n="lb">= Pali nītattha), {%of clear, definite, well-established meaning%};
<div n="lb">opp. a-nītārtha or {@neyārtha@}, {%having a meaning that is not%}
<div n="lb">(clearly) {%established, that has to be determined%} (by inference
<div n="lb">or the like); see LaVallée-Poussin, AbhidhK. ix.246--8 for
<div n="lb">very complete and illuminating discussion of these terms
<div n="lb">in Pali and BHS. (In Pali neither is ipso facto preferred
<div n="lb">to the other; one errs only in interpreting one as if it
<div n="lb">were the other, nītattha as neyyattha, or vice versa;
<div n="lb">see esp. AN i.60.13--15, and comm. ii.118.7--27; Dīpav.
<div n="lb">5.34, Oldenberg p. 36, and LaV-P. l.c.) In BHS a nītārtha
<div n="lb">text, {%de sens explicite%} (La V-P.), is recommended as a
<div n="lb">guide in preference to one that is neyārtha, Mvy 1549;
<div n="lb">Bbh 257.10 ff. Equivalent to neyārtha is a-nītārtha, for
<div n="lb">which see LaV-P. l.c. 248.
