{@anu-praṇidheti@}¦ (not in Pali), = {@praṇidheti@}, {%makes%}
<div n="lb">{%a vow%} (to persist towards enlightenment); °dheti Mv
<div n="lb">i.119.15; °dhemi (mss. anuparidehi) 323.1; °dhesi, aor.,
<div n="lb">335.11; °hitaṃ, ppp., i.63.3. See {@anupraṇidhi@}, which is
<div n="lb">commoner than the verb. If there is any difference be-
<div n="lb">tween this and praṇi° without anu, it does not appear
<div n="lb">clearly; anu does not necessarily imply {%after%} (a gift or
<div n="lb">meritorious act), tho this often precedes; in Mv i.323.1
<div n="lb">however none is mentioned.
