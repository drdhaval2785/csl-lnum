{@varāṅga@}¦, adj. (Skt. vara-aṅga; in Skt. recorded as
<div n="lb">Bhvr. only in a gloss in Amarakośa; not noted Pali or
<div n="lb">Pkt., but see below), lit. {%having excellent (bodily) members%};

<div n="lb">pw 7.372, the mg. would be {%elephant%} (so Skt. Lex.) in
<div n="lb">Mvy and Divy (so also Index to Divy). But the word in
<div n="lb">Divy clearly applies to all four regular divisions of an
<div n="lb">Indian army, specifically named here; if it meant {%elephant%}
<div n="lb">it would duplicate hastino. And in Mvy it is placed between
<div n="lb">{@mahānagna-@} and {@praskandi-@}balam (see these words),
<div n="lb">and separated from prākṛtahasti and gandhahasti-b° in
<div n="lb">8208--9. In MPS 31.21 a varāṅga's power rates very high,
<div n="lb">just below that of an {@ardha-nārāyaṇa@}, above that of a
<div n="lb">{@mahānagna@} and {@praskandin@}. PTSD s.v. vīra regards
<div n="lb">this as ‘distorted’ from vīraṅga-as in Pali; on the con-
<div n="lb">trary, I believe the Pali cliché DN i.89.5 etc. is compressed
<div n="lb">from an original closer to Mv i.49.5 etc.; it reads puttā
<div n="lb">…sūrā vīraṅgarūpā parasenappamaddanā (vīraṅga- for
<div n="lb">BHS vīrā varāṅga-).
