{%eḍūka,%}¦ cf. {%eḍuo%} (CII 2-1), supposed to be ‘a wall into which
<div n="lb">bones (meaning planks and other hard substances) have been
<div n="lb">inserted in order to strengthen the structure’, because it is
<div n="lb">explained in a commentary as {%asthy-aṅkita kuḍya;%} but {%asthy-%}
<div n="lb">{%aṅkita-kuḍya%} seems to mean a Buddhist {%stūpa%} raised on cor-
<div n="lb">poreal relics which were an object of worship. Although
<div n="lb">the word {%kuḍya%} is reckoned in the lexicons in the sense of a wall,
<div n="lb">it seems to mean ‘a mound’ in this case. The word {%aidūka%}
<div n="lb">derived from {%eḍūka%} is used in Buddhist Sanskrit in the
<div n="lb">sense of a Buddhist {%stūpa.%} See {%IHQ,%} Vol. XXIX, pp.
<div n="lb">302-03.
