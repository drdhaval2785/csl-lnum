{%aṣṭabhoga-tejaḥsvāmya%}¦ (IA 8), unbridled ownership
<div n="lb">endowed with all the rights associated with the enjoyment of
<div n="lb">property; translated as ‘with the eight rights of full possession’
<div n="lb">though {%aṣṭa%} probably means ‘all’ and not merely ‘eight’ (cf.
<div n="lb">{%aṣṭādaśa,%} etc.); cf. {%aṣṭabhoga-tejaḥsvāmyaṃ ca krayeṇ = ādāya%} (EI
<div n="lb">23), ‘having secured the {%aṣṭabhoga-tejaḥsvāmya%} rights by pur-
<div n="lb">chase’; (IA 19), translated as ‘the proprietorship of all the
<div n="lb">glory of the {%aṣṭa-bhoga%}’, and {%aṣṭa-bhoga%} explained as ‘the
<div n="lb">deposits of buried treasure ({%nidhi-nikṣepa%}), water, stones, the
<div n="lb">{%akṣīṇī,%} that which may accrue, that which has been made
<div n="lb">property, that which may be made property, and augmen-
<div n="lb">tation’. But there is probably no justification for taking
<div n="lb">{%nidhi-nikṣepa%} as a single unit.
<div n="P">{%Cf. aṣṭabhoga-tejassvāmya-daṇḍaśulka-yukta%} ({%Ind. Ant.,%}
<div n="lb">Vol. XIX, p. 247, text line 102), mentioned along with {%nidhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%nikṣepa-pāṣāṇ-ārām-ādi-catuṣ-prakāra-bīravaṇa-pārikh-āya-sahita.%} The
<div n="lb">separate mention of these two groups shows that {%aṣṭa-bhoga%}
<div n="lb">vaguely indicated all kinds of proprietary rights.
