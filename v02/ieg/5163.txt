{%saṃvat%}¦ (IE 8-1), originally an abbreviation of {%saṃvatsara%}
<div n="lb">(a year) or any of its declensional cases that can be used in ex-
<div n="lb">pressing a date; later stereotyped in the sense of ‘a year’ or
<div n="lb">‘an era’. It was generally regarded as indeclinable; but we
<div n="lb">have some cases of the use of forms with case-endings, e. g.,
<div n="lb">{%saṃvataḥ, saṃvatā, saṃvati%} and {%saṃvatām.%} See also {%saṃvate%} (IE
<div n="lb">8-1), the seventh case-ending of {%saṃvata,%} a corrupt form of
<div n="lb">{%saṃvat.%} Since the late medieval age, the word specially indi-
<div n="lb">cates the Vikrama era, although originally it was used with the
<div n="lb">name of any reckoning in quoting the dates of records, especially
<div n="lb">the regnal reckoning. The word is used in inscriptions in a
<div n="lb">large number of corrupt forms, e. g., {%samvata, samvatta, samata,%}
<div n="lb">{%samanta, samatta, saṃmat, samasta, smat, samvatu, samvatū,%} etc., etc.
