{%aṅga-bhoga%}¦ (EI 17; CITD), often associated with {%raṅga-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhoga%} as {%aṅga-raṅga-bhoga,%} usually explained as ‘decora-
<div n="lb">tions and illuminations of a deity’. That {%aṅga-bhoga%} means
<div n="lb">decoration of the image of a deity is clear from the fact
<div n="lb">that a queen is known to have received a village as an {%agrahāra%}
<div n="lb">for her {%aṅga-bhoga,%} i. e. as her pin-money ({%Bomb. Gaz.,%} Vol. I,
<div n="lb">Part ii, p. 448). Sometimes the land granted for the {%aṅga-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhoga%} of a deity came to be known as the deity's {%aṅga-bhoga%}
<div n="lb">({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XXXIII, p. 182); cf. {%aṅga,%} same as {%gātra%}
<div n="lb">(IA 11).
