{%bhujaṅga%}¦ (IA 20), an ogre. The word {%bhujaṅga%} was
<div n="lb">adopted in Javanese in the sense of a ‘pupil, disciple, scholar;
<div n="lb">a philologist, poet, literary councillor; an officially appointed
<div n="lb">professional usually residing at or near the court’. It has been
<div n="lb">suggested on this basis that Bhavadeva-bhaṭṭa's title
<div n="lb">{%Bālavalabhī-bhujaṅga%} may really mean ‘the pupil of the
<div n="lb">Bālavalabhī school’. See {%IHQ,%} Vol. XXVII, pp. 80-82.
