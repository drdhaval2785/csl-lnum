{%Ājñā%}¦ (IE 8-3; EI 27; BL; CII 3), an order or command;
<div n="lb">same as {%ājñapti%} or {%ājñāpti%} supposed to be connected
<div n="lb">with giving the order for the drawing up of a charter; person
<div n="lb">receiving a king's order regarding the preparation of a charter;
<div n="lb">usually translated as ‘executor of a grant’; standing alone,
<div n="lb">the word is supposed to indicate the office of the {%Dūtaka,%}
<div n="lb">though the latter seems to have been additionally responsible
<div n="lb">for giving the donee the possession of the gift land. Cf. {%Ep. Ind.,%}
<div n="lb">Vol. XIV, p. 362 (of the Gaṅga year 149) where the words are
<div n="lb">{%ājñā mahāmahattara-Śivarmā;%} also {%svayam = ājñā%} ({%CII,%} Vol.
<div n="lb">III, p. 115; {%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XVI, p. 19) taken to mean that
<div n="lb">the king employed no {%Dūtaka%} to convey the details of his grant
<div n="lb">to the local officers, but that he gave the details in person.
[Page-013+ 40]
<div n="lb">The expression {%sva-mukh-ājñā%} (literally, the oral order of the
<div n="lb">king) is also explained in the same way. The suggestion that
<div n="lb">{%Ājñādāpaka%} sometimes occurs as a synonym of {%Dūtaka%} is wrong.
<div n="lb">See {%Ājñapti, Ājñā-sañcārin,%} etc. Cf. {%Ind. Ep.,%} pp. 143-44.
<div n="P">{%Cf.%} Tamil {%āṇai%} (EI 23), sign; the insignia.
