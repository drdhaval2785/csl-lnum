{%bhūta-pāta-pratyāya%}¦ (CII 4), explained by some as ‘excise
<div n="lb">and octroi duties’; but really, ‘the income resulting from storms,
<div n="lb">earthquakes, changes in the course of a river, etc’. See {%bhūta-%}
<div n="lb">{%vāta-pratyāya,%} etc. {%Pāta%} may be a mistake for {%upātta%} or {%vāta.%}
