{%bhāga-bhoga-kara%}¦ (HRS), taken by some as a single levy
<div n="lb">and explained as the king's grain-share, identical with {%bhāga%}
<div n="lb">of the {%Arthaśāstra%} and {%bali%} of the Smṛtis, though distinguished
<div n="lb">from {%dhānya%} in a Maitraka record, where it has been supposed
<div n="lb">to mean a fixed contribution in kind as distinguished from
<div n="lb">the contribution consisting of a share of the produce. If
<div n="lb">{%bhāgabhogakara%} was a single levy (and did not indicate
<div n="lb">{%bhāga, bhoga%} and {%kara%}), it may have really been a tax collected
<div n="lb">in lieu of {%bhāga%} (grain share) and {%bhoga%} (periodical offerings).
