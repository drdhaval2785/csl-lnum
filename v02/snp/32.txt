<div n="P"/>Much confusion exists concerning this substance as will become
<div n="lb"/>apparent from the material collected:
<div n="P"/>(1) Bpn, {%karpūrādivarga%} 120: it is also called {%kapitthatvac%} (the bark
<div n="lb"/>of {%kapittha%}). Acc. to the Hindī comm. (p. 262-263) the substance is
<div n="lb"/>described somewhere in Bhā. pra. as resembling {%kaṅkola%} and smelling
<div n="lb"/>like {%kuṣṭha.%} In the same comm. three different identifications are made
[Page-531+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>mention of: a) <bot>PRUNUS CERASUS LINN.</bot>, b) <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES
<div n="lb"/>LINN.</bot>, c) <bot>MUKIA SCABRELLA ARN.</bot> (Index Kewensis: <bot>MELOTHRIA
<div n="lb"/>MADERASPATANA COGN.</bot> = <bot>MUKIA SCABRELLA ARN.</bot> = <bot>MUKIA MADERA-
<div n="lb"/>SPATANA M. ROEM</bot>).
<div n="P"/>(2) DWH 2, p. 105-107: <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES LINN.</bot>; p. 105:
<div n="lb"/>“This plant is called in Sanskrit {%vāluka%} and {%elavāluka%} on account of
<div n="lb"/>the number of large raphides contained in the leaves, and which give
<div n="lb"/>them the appearance of being full of sand ({%vālu%}).” (Raphides are
<div n="lb"/>minute intracellular crystals, usually of an acicular form).
<div n="P"/>(3) Gul: cherry tree (<bot>PRUNUS CERASUS LINN.</bot>).
<div n="P"/>(4) HB, p. 21: <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES LINN.</bot>; ibid., footnote 70:
<div n="lb"/>“{%elavālu%} is mentioned Su. Sū. 38, 14, where Ḍa.'s comm. explains it as
<div n="lb"/>a reddish powder ({%harivāluka%}), resembling that of the seeds of the
<div n="lb"/>{%kṛṣṇagandhā (kṛṣṇagandhikaphala).%} The latter is a name of the horse-
<div n="lb"/>radish tree or {%śigru%} or {%śobhāñjana;%}” ibid., p. 91, footnote 74: “In
<div n="lb"/>the Phar. Ind. (= DWH) 2, p. 105, it is wrongly identified with {%vāluka;%}
<div n="lb"/>the seeds, supplied to me by a native druggist, seem to be simply those
<div n="lb"/>of chickweed.”
<div n="P"/>(5) HK: quotes the identifications of PW and Hoernle.
<div n="P"/>(6) Kav, p. 37: a kind of red powder made of some seeds obtainable
<div n="lb"/>of every native druggist, not identified; p. 294: a fragrant powder of
<div n="lb"/>a bark sold under that name; it is believed to come from the Spice
<div n="lb"/>Islands; p. 642: Gaṅgādhara takes it as implying {%tejavala,%} a kind of
<div n="lb"/>wood apparently dry but juicy within; it is brought from Nepal.
<div n="P"/>(7) KB 2, p. 1187-1188: <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES LINN.</bot>
<div n="P"/>(8) MW: the fragrant bark of <bot>FERONIA ELEPHANTUM</bot> ({%kapitthatvac%});
<div n="lb"/>a granular substance (apparently a vegetable of a reddish-brown
<div n="lb"/>colour, used as a drug and perfume).
<div n="P"/>(9) PW: the fragrant bark of <bot>FERONIA ELEPHANTUM</bot> ({%kapitthatvac%}),
<div n="lb"/>used medicinally.
<div n="P"/>(10) V 7, p. 67: <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES.</bot>
<div n="P"/>(11) Vśs: name of a perfume; a red powder sold under that name;
<div n="lb"/>the seed of some plant.
<div n="P"/>(12) Ḍa. on Su. Sū. 38, 14 (printed ed., different from Hoernle's text):
<div n="lb"/>“a reddish powder ({%harivāluka%}), resembling the black, fragrant {%kaṭpha-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%la;%}” {%kaṭphala%} is usually identified as <bot>MYRICA NAGI THUNB.</bot>
