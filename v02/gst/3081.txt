{#anupalabDisama#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-maH-mA#}) (In the Nyāya philo-
<div n="lb">sophy.) A sophism on non-perception; viz. arguing: ‘be-
<div n="lb">cause the non-perception of an object cannot be perceived,
<div n="lb">therefore the non-perception of the object does not exist
[Page093-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">and consequently the non-existence of the object cannot
<div n="lb">exist i. e. the object itself must exist’. This sophism is at-
<div n="lb">tributed by the Nyāya e. g. to those who maintain the eter-
<div n="lb">nity of sound on the ground that ‘the non-perception of
<div n="lb">sound antecedently to pronunciation’--the reason alleged
<div n="lb">by the Nyāya for its non-eternity--may be refuted in
<div n="lb">the manner explained. E. {#anupalabDi#} and {#sama#} (m. scil.
<div n="lb">{#pratizeDa#} or {#vikalpa#} or {#prayoga;#} f. scil. {#jAti;#} comp. for the
<div n="lb">meaning of these words the E. of {#anityasama#}).
