{#aprastutapraSaMsA#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-sA#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of the
<div n="lb">{#alaNkAra#} q. v. or elegant modes of composition; viz. implied
<div n="lb">or indirect expression (literally: conveying--the subject
<div n="lb">matter--by what is not the subject matter); more espe-
<div n="lb">cially defined as conveying the subject matter, if it is of a
<div n="lb">specific nature by means of generalisation, or if it is of a
<div n="lb">general kind, by means of specification, or if it is viewed
<div n="lb">as a cause, by stating the effect, or if it is viewed as an
<div n="lb">effect, by stating the cause, or hinting at the subject matter
<div n="lb">by stating what is similar to it, (the latter category being
<div n="lb">divided in two varieties which are again split in two other
<div n="lb">varieties; while each of the named categories may be,
<div n="lb">moreover, threefold, according to whether the expressed
<div n="lb">special or general subject, fact, cause or similarity is of a
<div n="lb">real or imaginary or mixed nature); an instance of the
<div n="lb">second category is the following: {#sragiyaM yadi jIvitApahA#}
<div n="lb">{#hfdaye kiM nihitA na hanti mAm . vizamapyamftaM kvacidBavedamftaM#}
<div n="lb">{#vA vizamISvarecCayA,#} where the {%general%} idea that the will
<div n="lb">of God may turn evil into good and good into evil, is
<div n="lb">conveyed by the special instance of poison and amṛta. E.
<div n="lb">{#aprastuta#} and {#praSaMsA#}.
