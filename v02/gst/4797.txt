<div n="lb">prehension; e. g. in the {%Vedānta Sūtra:%} {#aparigrahAccAtyanta-#}
<div n="lb">{#manapekzA#}. <sup>2</sup> Non-acceptance. In the latter sense this word
<div n="lb">has assumed a special bearing in the {%Yoga%} philosophy and
<div n="lb">in such passages of the {%Upan.%} and other writings (compare
<div n="lb">e. g. {%Wilson's Viṣṇup.%} p. 288. n. 2), as refer to the doctrine
<div n="lb">of this philosophy; it means there: {%renouncing every thing%}
<div n="lb">{%that can afford enjoyment,%} as a commentator observes,
<div n="lb">from the perception of the defects that inhere in mundane
<div n="lb">objects, as they must be acquired, preserved, as they pe-
<div n="lb">rish, produce affection and cause the infliction of injury

<div n="lb">the term {#yama#} q. v., the latter being one of the eight Angas
<div n="lb">or constituent parts of the Yoga (see {#yogANga#}). Renun-
<div n="lb">ciation however must be understood there in its widest sense,
<div n="lb">also as indifference to one's own body, since the soul's as-
<div n="lb">suming a body is also {#parigraha#} or covetousness, for body
<div n="lb">is the instrument of enjoyment and passion is connected
<div n="lb">with it; and only the Yogin who is firm in the renun-
<div n="lb">ciation in this widest sense, obtains a knowledge of the
<div n="lb">condition of former and subsequent existences: {#aparigra-#}
