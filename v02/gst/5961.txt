{#aBicAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) Incantation, employment of charms
<div n="lb">or spells for a malevolent purpose.--The {%Shaḍvinśa-Brā-%}
<div n="lb">{%hmaṇa%} names as such purposes: killing an enemy and de-
<div n="lb">priving him of his cattle or property; it gives an account
<div n="lb">of four sacrifices which are performed for the attainment
<div n="lb">of these objects, (see {#Syena, trivfdagnizwoma, saMdaMSa#} and {#vajra#})
<div n="lb">and describes the manner in which the mantras are to be
<div n="lb">recited at these sacrifices; (see {#vizwuti#}).--The {%Tantrasāra%}
<div n="lb">(as quoted by {%Rādhākāntad.%}) names six purposes of incan-
<div n="lb">tation, viz. causing death ({#mAraRa#}), mental aberration ({#mo-#}
<div n="lb">{#hana#}), stoppage of the bodily functions ({#stamBana#}), hatred ({#vi-#}
<div n="lb">{#dvezaRa#}), ruin ({#uccAwana#}) and submission ({#vaSIkaraRa#}). [Comp.
<div n="lb">e. g. also the following passage from the {%Skanda-Purāṇa:%}
<div n="lb">{#kuSErvA dUrvayA devi Asane SuBrakambale . upaviSya tato devi#}
<div n="lb">{#japedekAgramAnasaH#} (scil. {#gurugItAm#}) {#. SuklAsane vE SAntyarTe#}

<div n="lb">{#param . devaBUpapriyakaraM rAjAnaM vaSamAnayet#} &c.]--{%Suśruta%}
<div n="lb">speaks of a variety of fever caused by incantation (see {#a-#}
<div n="lb">{#BicArajvara#} and comp. {#aBizaNgajvara#}), the symptoms of
<div n="lb">which are, according to the {%Nighaṇṭa Prakāśa,%} thirst,
<div n="lb">mental aberration, abscesses, delirium, fainting, anguish,
<div n="lb">excessive heat &c.--{%Manu%} (likewise Viṣṇu &c.) when
<div n="lb">speaking of incantations (9. 290.) makes a distinction between
<div n="lb">{#aBicAra, mUlakarman#} and various {#kftyA;#} the former com-
<div n="lb">prises, according to {%Medhātithi%} and {%Kullūka%} as well incan-
<div n="lb">tations founded on vaidik writings ({#vEdika#} or {#SAstrIya,#}
<div n="lb">such as the Śyena &c.), as those founded on vulgar super-
<div n="lb">stition ({#lOkika,#} such as taking the dust of the feet, digging
<div n="lb">in needles--{#sUcIniKanana#} in the E. I. H. Mss. of {%Medh.%} being
<div n="lb">apparently a better reading than {#mUlaniKanana#} in the present edd.
<div n="lb">of {%Kull.%}--&c.) for the purpose of {%causing death;%} {#mUlakarman#} is,
<div n="lb">according to both comm., {%subduing%} a person by means of
<div n="lb">mantras, drugs &c. ({%Kull.:%} {#mantrOzaDAdinA;#} {%Medh.:%} {#mantrA-#}
<div n="lb">{#dikriyayA#}); the {#kftyA#} are, according to {%Kullūka,%} incantations
<div n="lb">for the sake of {%causing ruin, making sick%} &c., according to
<div n="lb">{%Medh.,%} for the sake of {%causing ruin, animosity between friends%}
<div n="lb">{%or relatives, working wonders%} &c. ({#uccAwanasuhfdbanDukalahavici-#}
<div n="lb">{#trIkaraRAdihetavaH#}).--{%Manu%} fines a person who employs
<div n="lb">charms two hundred Paṇas (9. 290.), classes in another pas-
<div n="lb">sage {#aBicAra#} and {#mUlakarman#} amongst the Upapātaka (11. 63.)
<div n="lb">and makes the expiation of an {#aBicAra#} depend on the per-
<div n="lb">formance, thrice repeated, of the penance called Kṛchchhra
<div n="lb">(11. 197.). But as these clauses would jar apparently with
<div n="lb">the vaidik texts which impliedly sanction the employment
<div n="lb">of charms by regulating the sacrifices Śyena &c. performed
<div n="lb">for incantatory purposes, {%Kullūka%} qualifies the definition of
<div n="lb">Manu 11. 63. by commenting that {#aBicAra#} is an {#upapAtaka,#} if
<div n="lb">it causes the death of an {%innocent%} or {%unoffending%} person ({#SyenA-#}
<div n="lb">{#diyajYenAnaparADasya mAraRam#}), while {%Medhātithi%} seems merely
[Page240-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">to lay stress on the fact of {%death%} itself (although the death
<div n="lb">be that of an enemy) and perhaps too on the condition of
<div n="lb">death being caused by a {%vaidik%} kind of incantation ({%Medh.%}
<div n="lb">to 11. 63.: {#aBicAro vEdikena SApAdinA mantraprayogeRa Sye-#}
<div n="lb">{#nAdiyAgena vA SatrumAraRam,#} or to 11. 197.: {#vEdikena japaho-#}
<div n="lb">{#mAdinA SatrormAraRamaBicAraH#}); for the same reason, pro-
<div n="lb">bably, both comm. agree in giving to the penalty clause
<div n="lb">(9. 290) the additional sense: ‘if the incantation does {%not%}
<div n="lb">{%cause death%}’, and qualify, in the clause 11. 197., the incan-
<div n="lb">tation as one ‘directed against a person who ought not to have
<div n="lb">been brought under the spell (i. e. an innocent or unoffending
<div n="lb">person)’; some however, as results from {%Medh.'%}s discussion
<div n="lb">on the latter verse, give it a different bearing, for they supply
<div n="lb">the preceding word {#yAjana#} at {#aBicAra#} and subject thus to the
<div n="lb">penance Kṛchchhra, not the {#yajamAna#} or the person who
<div n="lb">institutes an incantatory sacrifice, but the {#ftvij#} or the
<div n="lb">priest who performs for him such a sacrifice. But in spite
<div n="lb">of these efforts of the commentators to establish a harmony
<div n="lb">between Manu and the Veda, it will seem that another
<div n="lb">possibility alluded to by {%Medhātithi%} is more plausible, viz.
<div n="lb">that Manu did not attach any scriptural authority to such
<div n="lb">voluntary rites, as the incantatory sacrifices, and, there-
<div n="lb">fore, did not consider himself at variance with the Veda,
<div n="lb">when he interdicted incantations in an unqualified manner;
<div n="lb">({%Medhātithi:%} {#nanu ca kAmyAnyapi nizidDAni . kAmAtmatA na praSa-#}
<div n="lb">{#steti . yattasya vizayaH . sa tatrEva vyAKyAtaH#}). E. {#car#} with
<div n="lb">{#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
