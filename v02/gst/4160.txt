{#annAda#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-daH-dI-dam#}) Eating food &c. (see
<div n="lb">the meanings of {#anna#}); also eating the metaphysical or
<div n="lb">mystical {#anna#} 2. 2.; said e. g. of the Supreme Soul {#‘aha-#}
<div n="lb">{#mannamahamannAdaH’#} (comm. {#advEta AtmA niraYjano'pi sannaha-#}
<div n="lb">{#mevAnnamannAdaSca#}); or {#‘sEzA virAqannAdI’#} (comm. {#sEzA vi-#}
<div n="lb">{#rAqdaSasaMKyA satyannaM cAnnAdinI ca#}). E. {#anna#} and {#Ada#} ({#ad,#}
<div n="lb">kṛt aff. {#aR#}). [NB. This etymol. is the regular one, but
<div n="lb">according to the comm. of Pāṇ., restricted to the classical
<div n="lb">dialect; in the Vedas the word is treated as if the latter
<div n="lb">part were {#ada#} ({#ad,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#}) or, in other words: {#annAda,#}
[Page137-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">fem. {#°dI#} is in the vaidik literature udātta on the last syl-
<div n="lb">lable, while in the classical dialect it would be udātta on
<div n="lb">the first. This is the bearing of the instance {#annAdAya#}
<div n="lb">(dative of {#annAda#}) in the comm. on the Kārikā to Pāṇini
<div n="lb">III. 1. 85., when the comm. observes {#‘aRvizaye'c’;#} comp.
<div n="lb">Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇ. III. 2. 1.; {#‘annAdAyeti ca kftAM vyatya-#}
<div n="lb">{#yaSCandasi’ . annAdAyeti ca kftAM vyatyayaSCandasi drazwavyaH .#}
<div n="lb">{#annAdAyAnnapataye . AhutimannAdIM hutvA . karmaRyaR;#} where-
<div n="lb">upon Kaiyyaṭa: {#annAdAyeti . annamattItyaRaH prasaNge'cpratyayaH#}
<div n="lb">{#kriyate . tena anna'adAyetyevamavagraha upapadyate#}.--In the
<div n="lb">present edition of Pāṇini there is a misprint {#annAdAyaH#} in-
<div n="lb">stead of {#annAdAya#} (the latter being correctly given in the
<div n="lb">corresponding place of the Siddh. Kaum. fol. 217 b. line 15);
<div n="lb">in the mutilated reprint of that edition the error has been
<div n="lb">repeated, as in similar cases, and somewhere else a new
<div n="lb">vaidik word has been founded on it viz ‘{#annAdAya#} adj. ved.’
<div n="lb">with a meaning ‘taking food’ and with an etymology ‘{#anna#}
<div n="lb">and {#AdAya#}’; it needs not be observed that the quoted words
<div n="lb">{#‘aRvizaye'c’#} would become quite meaningless with such a
<div n="lb">formation ‘{#annAdAya#} adj.’, since the āgama {#yuk#} could not
<div n="lb">occur in a derivative with kṛt aff. {#ac#}.]
