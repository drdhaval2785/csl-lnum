{#atityad#}Â¦ Tatpur. Beyond that. E. {#ati#} (sc. {#krAnta#}) and {#tyad#}
<div n="lb">(in the sense of the accusative). This word seems to be
<div n="lb">only one of grammatical coinage, to show that the declen-
<div n="lb">sion of {#tyad#} in compositions like these is like that of other
<div n="lb">nouns ending in {#d#} and not that of the pronominal theme
<div n="lb">{#tyad;#} i. e. {#atityad, atityadO#} &c. (instead of {#atisyaH,#}
<div n="lb">{#atityO#} &c.).
