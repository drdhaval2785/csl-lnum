{#aBiBAyatana#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) (In Buddhistic doctrine.) ‘The
<div n="lb">basis of mastership or superiority’; {#aBiBAyatanAni#} or the
<div n="lb">(eight) bases of superiority are the (eight) mental accom-
<div n="lb">plishments or superior powers of a man who by having
<div n="lb">internally the {%idea of form,%} perceives externally <sup>1</sup> {%limited%} or
<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> {%illimited forms,%} either {%with agreeable%} or {%disagreeable colours,%}
<div n="lb">by having internally the {%idea of absence of form%} perceives
<div n="lb">externally <sup>3</sup> {%limited%} or <sup>4</sup> {%illimited forms,%} either, too, {%with%}
<div n="lb">{%agreeable%} or {%disagreeable colours,%} and by having internally
<div n="lb">the {%idea of absence of form%} perceives externally <sup>5</sup> {%dark-blue%}
<div n="lb">{%forms with dark-blue colours, aspect or appearance, <sup>6</sup> yellow%}
<div n="lb">{%forms with yellow colours, aspect or appearance, <sup>7</sup> red forms%}
<div n="lb">{%with red colours, aspect or appearance,%} and <sup>8</sup> {%white forms%}
<div n="lb">{%with white colours, aspect or appearance.%} See {%Burnouf's Lo-%}
<div n="lb">{%tus de la bonne loi;%} append. XV. E. {#aBiBA#} 2. and {#Ayatana;#}
<div n="lb">({%Burnouf 1. c.%} considers the word as a {%Pāli%} form represent-
<div n="lb">ing the Sanskṛt {#aBiBvAyatana,#} i. e. {#aBiBu#} or {#aBiBU#} and
<div n="lb">{#Ayatana,#} and renders it accordingly ‘the place or region
<div n="lb">of the {%conqueror%}’; but as {#aBiBA = aBiBUti#} or {#aBiBava#}
<div n="lb">may also have the active meaning, it seems better to adopt
<div n="lb">the given E. and to take the word as a pure Sanskṛt
<div n="lb">compound, meaning ‘that on which victory rests’, and
<div n="lb">similar in formation to the Buddh. {#rUpAyatana#} or {#AkASA-#}
