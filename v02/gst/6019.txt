<div n="lb">‘truth’, instead of ‘law’, in conformity with the judicious

<div n="lb">{#BiDarmapiwaka#} q. v.--The first redaction of the Abhidharma
<div n="lb">is ascribed to {%Kāśyapa%} or {%Mahā-Kaśyapa,%} the principal
<div n="lb">disciple of {%Śākya Muni;%} but the redaction of the whole col-
<div n="lb">lection of works on this subject seems to belong to different
<div n="lb">periods the last of which precedes the third Buddhistic
<div n="lb">synod; (see {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} vol. II. p. 458). {%Hodgson%} re-
<div n="lb">lates of four great {%Nepalese%} schools divided on account of

<div n="lb">{%Kārmika%} and {%Yātnika%} (see {%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%} p. 441 and the
<div n="lb">quotation given there); {%Csoma de Körös%} speaks of four
<div n="lb">other {%Tibetian%} schools which are divided and subdivided
<div n="lb">into various sects: 1. the {%Vaibhāṣikās%} which comprise four
<div n="lb">sects: {%a.%} one founded by {%Rāhula,%} the son of Śākya, and
<div n="lb">subdivided at the period of the third synod into seven sects:
<div n="lb">the Mūla-sarvāsti-vādās, Kāśyapīyās, Mahīśāsakās, Dhar-
<div n="lb">maguptās, Bahuśrutīyās, Tāmraśātīyās and Vibhādyavā-
<div n="lb">dinas; {%b.%} one founded by {%Kāśyapa,%} a Brāhmaṇa, and sub-
<div n="lb">divided into six sects, five of which, bearing the collective
<div n="lb">name of Mahāsaṅghikās, were known at the time of the
<div n="lb">third synod: the Pūrvaśailās, Avaraśailās, Haimavatās,
<div n="lb">Lokottaravādinas and Prajnaptivādinas; {%c.%} one founded by
<div n="lb">{%Upāli,%} a Śūdra, and having the surname Sammatās, sub-
<div n="lb">divided into three sects: the Kaurmakullakās (?), Āvan-
<div n="lb">tikās and Vātsīputrīyās; {%d.%} one founded by {%Kātyāyana,%} a
