{#anutpattisama#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-maH-mA#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
<div n="lb">The sophism of the impossibility of origin or birth; viz.
<div n="lb">arguing that a thing cannot take origin, because a thing
<div n="lb">exists in consequence of an immaterial cause; as the latter,
<div n="lb">however, does not exist before the material cause and the
<div n="lb">instance proving the existence of such material cause, and
<div n="lb">as the material cause again depends upon what exists, and
<div n="lb">the instance upon the material cause, the thing itself can
<div n="lb">never come into existence: or origin in general is impossible.
<div n="lb">E. {#anutpatti#} and {#sama#}. (With respect to the gender of this
<div n="lb">word and the ellipsis required to explain it, see the E. of
<div n="lb">{#anityasama#}.)
