{#atIva#}Â¦ Tatpur. ind. Much, very much, much indeed. (Some-
<div n="lb">times {#atIva#} may be explained as representing the two
<div n="lb">distinct words {#ati#} (the preposition) and {#iva#} which through
<div n="lb">Sandhi form {#atIva#} but which are not then to be considered
<div n="lb">as an inseparable Tatpur. compound.) E. {#ati#} and {#iva#}.
