{#apahartf#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-rtA-rtrI-rtf#}) <sup>1</sup> One who takes
<div n="lb">away, carries off, removes. <sup>2</sup> One who steals. <sup>3</sup> One who
<div n="lb">conceals or secretes; e. g. {#nikzepasyApahartAram#} (comm. = {#ni-#}
<div n="lb">{#kzepasyApahnotAram#}).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-rtA#}) The name of a brother of the serpent Śeṣa
<div n="lb">(according to the {%Harivanśa%} in the translation of {%Langlois%}
<div n="lb">vol. II. p. 481). E. {#hf#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#tfc#} or {#tfn#}. [N. B.
<div n="lb">When derived with the kṛt {#tfc,#} the word merely expresses
<div n="lb">the notion of the {%agens in general,%} as is the case with all
<div n="lb">other derivatives of radicals by means of {#tfc;#} a noun de-
<div n="lb">pending on it then stands in the genitive, e. g. {#nikzepasyApa-#}
<div n="lb">{#hartA#} ‘a man who secretes a deposit’. But when derived
<div n="lb">by means of the affix {#tfn#} it implies moreover {%habit%} and, a
<div n="lb">noun depending on it in this sense stands in the accus., e. g.
<div n="lb">{#annamapahartAra AhvarakA Bavanti SrAdDe sidDe sati#} ‘the in-
<div n="lb">habitants of Ahwara are in the {%habit of carrying off%} the food
<div n="lb">after the funeral oblation is performed’; it might seem doubt-
<div n="lb">ful, therefore, whether e. g. the passage of the {%Dāyabhāga%}
<div n="lb">p. 351, line 18: {#asuvarRaM suvarRabudDyApaharturna suvarRApahAraH#} is
<div n="lb">correct and ought not to be {#asuvarRasya#} &c., the word {#apahartf#}
<div n="lb">expressing there simply the agens without an additional
<div n="lb">notion, as results from the comparison of these words with
<div n="lb">p. 350. 1. 16. The word when derived by kṛt {#tfc#} is udātta
<div n="lb">on the last syllable; but when derived by {#tfn#} udātta on the
<div n="lb">first syllable.]
