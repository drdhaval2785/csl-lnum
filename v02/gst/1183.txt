{#atiTi#}¦ I. 1. m. f. n. ({#-TiH-TI-Ti#}) One who arrives and,
<div n="lb">though entirely unknown, is entitled to the rites of hospi-
<div n="lb">tality, a guest. See {#atiTin#}.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-TiH#}) <sup>1</sup> A proper name of a king of Ayodhyā, the
<div n="lb">son of Kuśa and grandson of Rāma. <sup>2</sup> The vaidik name of an
<div n="lb">attendant of Soma. (This latter meaning is more likely to
<div n="lb">be taken in a figurative sense, Soma being mentioned as
<div n="lb">the name of a king and Agni, Atithi, Śyena as those of his
<div n="lb">attendants). E. {#at,#} uṇ. aff. {#iTin#}. ({#atiTi#} in the mean-
<div n="lb">ing of ‘guest’ is also explained as a Bahuvr. ‘one who has
<div n="lb">no kind of {#tiTi#} or holy day, who may arrive any day’
<div n="lb">or ‘one who does not sojourn a whole tithi, but only one
<div n="lb">single night’, or ‘one who is not steady (when {#tiTi#} is
<div n="lb">supposed to be a mutilated form of {#sTiti#})’; all these ex-
<div n="lb">planations are artificial.)
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. ({#-TiH#}) Wrath, anger. E. {#a#} priv. and
<div n="lb">{#tiTi#} ‘not restricted to a tithi, what may come at any time’.
