<div n="lb">{#antarAyAm#} when referring to {#puri;#} see meaning I. 1. 1.)
<div n="P">1. <sup>1</sup> Interior, being in the middle of or between, the
<div n="lb">reverse of {#vAhya;#} e. g. {#AtmA sarvAntaraH;#} or {#aDyAvasAyABimA-#}
<div n="lb">{#nasaMkalpAlocanAni cAntarARi vAhyASca sarve vyApArA Atmani#}
<div n="lb">{#pratizidDAni bodDavyAni#}.--The words {#antaraH SAwakaH,#} plur.
<div n="lb">({#antare#} or {#antarAH SAwakAH#}) mean ‘lower garments’, ac-
<div n="lb">cording to some, ‘of three or four garments that which is
<div n="lb">nearest the body’ (lit. between the body and the exterior
<div n="lb">garment); {#antare#} or {#antarA gfhA#} (comp. {#antaragfha#}) may
<div n="lb">mean either ‘the houses in the interior of a town’, or
<div n="lb">‘those situated outside of the town and inhabited by
<div n="lb">Chāṇḍālas and other low-caste people’. (The apparent
<div n="lb">contradiction between these two meanings arises from the
<div n="lb">interpretation of {#vahiryoga#} in Pāṇ. I. 1. 36. which according
<div n="lb">to the comm. on the Mahābhāṣya may mean ‘connexion with
<div n="lb">an unenclosed place ({#vahis#}), and become applicable to
<div n="lb">what is outside’ or may mean ‘connexion with the exterior
<div n="lb">and then apply to what is interior’. Comp. however I. 2. 4.)
<div n="lb">{#antarA pur#} means ‘a place outside of a town or outside of
<div n="lb">a palace’ ({#pur#} implying according to the comm. on the
<div n="lb">Mahābhāṣya either the interior of a palace or what is
<div n="lb">outside of it; comp. {#antaHpura#}); e. g. {#antarAyAM#} (not {#antara-#}
<div n="lb">{#syAM#}) {#puri vasati;#} but see meaning I. 2. 4. <sup>2</sup> Different from,
<div n="lb">with a noun in the abl., e. g. {#yo'psu tizWannadByo'ntaro…#}
<div n="lb">{#eza ta AtmAntaryAmyamftaH#}. <sup>3</sup> Devoid of(?).
<div n="P">2. <sup>1</sup> Near, proximate (esp. ved.). <sup>2</sup> Similar; comp. also
<div n="lb">{#antaratama#}. <sup>3</sup> Related, dear; e. g. {#ayamatyantaro mama#}. Comp.
<div n="lb">also {#antaratara#}. <sup>4</sup> Exterior. (See the instances under I. 1. 1.
<div n="lb">and compare with {#antare#} or {#°rA gfhA#} the word {#antevAsin#}
<div n="lb">‘a Chāṇḍāla’.)
<div n="P">II. n. ({#-ram#}) 1. <sup>1</sup> The interior lit. and fig. <sup>2</sup> Interval,

<div n="lb">The difference between two figures, as resulting from sub-
<div n="lb">traction, e. g. {#kAryaH kramAdutkramato'TavANkayogo yaTAsTAna-#}
<div n="lb">{#kamantaraM vA;#} or {#vajrAByAsayorantaram#}. <sup>8</sup> An other manner,
<div n="lb">another way, another kind; in this meaning {#antara#} is
<div n="lb">always the latter part of a compound and will in most
<div n="lb">instances answer our word ‘other’ when preceding the
<div n="lb">noun, the gender of {#antara#} remaining, of course, the same
<div n="lb">i. e. neuter, whatever be the gender of the noun preceding
<div n="lb">it as first part of the compound, e. g. {#arTAntaram, hetvanta-#}
<div n="lb">{#ram, budDyantaram, pratijYAntaram#} qq. vv. <sup>9</sup> A species, a va-
<div n="lb">riety, a kind; e. g. {#matsyo mInAntare,#} ‘{#matsya#} means a species

<div n="lb">ness, a deficiency, a failing; e. g. {#antarataH kaliH…#}

<div n="lb"><sup>12</sup> The interior in a philosophical sense, the supreme Soul,
<div n="lb">the soul, e. g. {#dfzwvAntaraM jyotirupArarAma;#} the mind, e. g.
<div n="lb">{#sAntaraduHKa#} (comm. {#antaHkaraRaduHKasahita#}). Comp. {#antara-#}

<div n="lb">the creditor and debtor’). <sup>14</sup> Disappearance(?). See the
<div n="lb">following.
[Page119-b+ 56]
<div n="P">2. <sup>1</sup> End. <sup>2</sup> Destruction, annihilation. (Both meanings
<div n="lb">occur in a Ms. of Ajayapāla viz. {#‘anta’#} and {#‘vinASa’#} besides
<div n="lb">{#‘antarDi’;#} the copy I use, however, is too indifferent
<div n="lb">in this place to be relied upon; the meaning {#vyasana#} which
<div n="lb">is amongst the meanings given in one of the Mss. of the
<div n="lb">Nānārthamañjarī--E. I. H. 2544--may imply the same
<div n="lb">notion but may also coincide with II. 1. 11. ‘a weakness &c.’;
<div n="lb">‘{#ranDre maDye vinAvasre#} (sic; instead of {#vinA'vasare#} which
<div n="lb">would give one syllable too much) {#vyavaDAne'ntarAtmani .#}
<div n="lb">{#bahiryoge'vakASe ca viSeze vyasane'ntaram#}’; but there oc-
<div n="lb">curs a safer trace of the latter meaning in a comm. of
<div n="lb">the Nalodaya (3. 6.) where the various reading {#antaratadvfdDizu#}
<div n="lb">is amongst others explained {#‘antaraM vinASaM tanotIti anta-#}
<div n="lb">{#ratat . tAdfSA vfdDayaH . nalasya fdDayo DanAgamAstezu’#}).
<div n="P">III. See {#antaram#} and {#antareRa#}. E. The native etym. {#anta#}
<div n="lb">and {#ra#} (from {#rA,#} kṛt aff. {#ka#}) has no probability. It seems
<div n="lb">that the meanings arranged under I. 1. and II. 1. are con-
<div n="lb">nected in origin with those of {#antar#} and the meanings under
<div n="lb">I. 2. and II. 2. with the meanings of {#anta,#} the former in the
<div n="lb">lineage of the notions of <sup>a.</sup> within; <sup>b.</sup> 1. in the middle,
<div n="lb">between, 2. interval, 3. difference, 4. breach; <sup>c.</sup> under(?);
<div n="lb">the latter in the lineage of <sup>a.</sup> end, <sup>b.</sup> proximity, <sup>c.</sup> exterior.
<div n="lb">But in the same manner as the meanings of {#anta#} and {#antar#}
<div n="lb">coincide in many respects (comp. also {#antarA#}) as probably
<div n="lb">arising from the same origin, it would appear possible to
<div n="lb">derive {#antara#} (comp. {#antama#}), as well as {#anta#} and {#antar#}
<div n="lb">from a common source instead of assuming that {#antara#} re-
<div n="lb">presents two etym., one from {#anta#} and another from {#antar#}
<div n="lb">See the Preface. [In a Gaṇalist to Pāṇini, {#antara#} occurs
<div n="lb">among the words which as latter parts form Tatpur. com-
<div n="lb">pounds with other words depending on them in the sense
<div n="lb">of a locative; but it seems that the reading {#antar,#} which
<div n="lb">is given in the Ganaratnam. and exemplified in its comm.--
<div n="lb">while only mention is made there of the reading {#antara#}--,
<div n="lb">is preferable; see s. v. {#antar#} V. 2.]
