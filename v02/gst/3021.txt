{#anunAsika#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-kaH-kA-kam#}) (In Grammar.) Uttered
<div n="lb">through the nose, nasal (see also {#rakta#}), viz. <sup>1</sup> A nasal sound
<div n="lb">in general, it being pronounced through the nose and with
<div n="lb">the appropriate organ of speech, as {#N#} through the nose
<div n="lb">and the throat, {#Y#} through the nose and with the palate &c.
<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> (Conditionally) a vowel or {#y, v, l;#} in this case the nasal
<div n="lb">nature of the sound is indicated by the sign {#M~#}. (N. B. {#yM~#} or
<div n="lb">{#vM~#} represent the value of {#y#} or {#v#} preceded by {#m; lM~#} that
<div n="lb">of {#l#} preceded by {#m#} or {#n#}. In the pause a final vowel may
<div n="lb">be anunāsika. A {%short%} anunāsika vowel, when not occurr-
<div n="lb">ing in a pause, represents apparently always the value of
<div n="lb">the same vowel and {#m#} or {#n;#} it must be, in general, the
<div n="lb">last vowel sound of the former part of a compound or of
<div n="lb">the word itself, followed by a final sibilant, e. g. {#saM~skartA#}
<div n="lb">instead of {#sams-kartA, puM~ScalI = pums-calI, tasmiM~stvA =#}
<div n="lb">{#tasmins-tvA#}. Only a few exceptions of this rule are mentioned
<div n="lb">by the vaidik grammarians, e. g. {#aminantaM~ evEH,#} when {#a#} of {#nta#}
<div n="lb">is anunāsika, although it does neither stand in a pause nor
<div n="lb">represent more than its own sound.--A {%long%} anunāsika
<div n="lb">vowel, when not occurring in a pause, may be generally
<div n="lb">considered as representing the value of its short vowel and
<div n="lb">an original {#nts#} or of its short vowel and {#nt,#} provided {#s#} or
<div n="lb">its substitute has been preserved; e. g. {#mahAM~ indraH = mahants#}
<div n="lb">{#indraH, daDanvAM~ yaH = daDanvants yaH, sargAM~ iva = sargants iva#}
<div n="lb">or {#mahAM~Scarati = mahants carati, dasyUM~rekaH = dasyunts ekaH#}.
<div n="lb">The material difference that prevails between the anunāsika
<div n="lb">({#M~#}) and the anusvāra ({#M#}) sound, does not appear to have
<div n="lb">been kept alive beyond the period of the vaidik literature,
<div n="lb">when an interchange between both was not deemed legiti-
<div n="lb">mate; according to the grammarians of the classical period,
<div n="lb">in the latter the anunāsika may be replaced by the anu-
<div n="lb">svāra. The sign of the anunāsika ({#M~#}), however, is but
<div n="lb">seldom met with in the ordinary Mss. referring to the post-
<div n="lb">vaidik literature; and from the reasons stated, its use in
<div n="lb">vaidik Mss. is objectionable, when it occurs in words like
<div n="lb">{#yaSAM~si, DanUM~zi, viSvezAM~ hitaH#} or in {#maM~hizWa, vAjaM~ sanizat, indraM~#}
<div n="lb">{#stavAma#} and similar instances in which the long nasal vowel
<div n="lb">does not represent more than the value of a short vowel
<div n="lb">and a nasal, or in which the short nasal vowel is not fol-
<div n="lb">lowed by a final sibilant.) E. {#anu#} and {#nAsikA#}.
