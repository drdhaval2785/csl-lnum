{#aTarvANgiras#}Â¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-rAH#}) The Angiras of the Athar-
<div n="lb">vaveda. This use of the word, as a Tatpur. in the sing.,
<div n="lb">is of later origin than that of the Dwandwa in the plur.,
<div n="lb">and, as it seems, adopted to explain the form {#aTarvANgi-#}
<div n="lb">{#rasa#} q. v.
<div n="P">II. Dwandwa. m. pl. ({#-rasaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of Athar-
<div n="lb">van and of Angiras. <sup>2</sup> The Atharvaveda hymns of both
<div n="lb">collectively; the Atharvaveda (q. v.), one part (or parvan)
<div n="lb">of which is considered to have been revealed by the descen-
<div n="lb">dants of Atharvan and another by the descendants of An-
<div n="lb">giras. According to another explanation, however, this
<div n="lb">name of the Atharvaveda would merely refer to Atharvan
<div n="lb">(q. v.) being the inspired author of one part and Angiras
<div n="lb">(q. v.) of the other. E. {#aTarvan#} and {#aNgiras#}.
