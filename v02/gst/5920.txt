{#aBiKyayAdava#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-vaH#}) The {%celebrated%} Yādava,
<div n="lb">i. e. Kṛṣṇa; {%Hemachandra%} (in the definition of {#matsya#}):
<div n="lb">{#matsyo mInAntare mIne virAwe'BiKyayAdave#} (thus the printed
<div n="lb">ed. of {%Hemach. nān.%} and the Mss. of the E. I. H. and of
<div n="lb">the R. A. S.; in several Mss. of the {%Viśvaprak.,%} belonging
<div n="lb">to the E. I. H. and the R. S., this verse runs: {#°°°virA-#}
<div n="lb">{#wABiKyayAdave,#} but as this reading is clearly wrong and as
<div n="lb">a correction {#virAwABiKye yAdave#} would be at variance with
<div n="lb">the metre, it must be assumed that it ought to be the same
<div n="lb">as in the text of {%Hemachandra%}). E. {#aBiKya#} and {#yAdava#}.
