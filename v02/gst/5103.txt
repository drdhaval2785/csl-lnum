{#apAnnapAt#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-t#}) (ved.) An epithet or name of
<div n="lb">Agni (fire) and Savitri (sun).--{%Sāyaṇa%} explains this word
<div n="lb">as meaning literally either ‘not protecting ({#na-pAt,#} from
<div n="lb">{#pA,#} kṛt aff. {#Satf#}) or not allowing to fall down ({#na-pAt#}
<div n="lb">from the caus. of {#pat,#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#}) the waters’, fire or
<div n="lb">sun drying up the water; or ‘the grandson of the waters’,
<div n="lb">water bringing forth plants and trees, and plants and trees
<div n="lb">being the cause of fire; the latter explanation, apparently
<div n="lb">more congenial with the vaidik poetry than the former, is
<div n="lb">also given by {%Yāska.%} Comp. {#ap#} and {#apAnnaptf#}. [The word has
<div n="lb">two accents, viz. the udātta on the second and third syllable
<div n="lb">and is given by the Padatext of the Ṛgveda as representing
<div n="lb">not a compound, but two distinct words; that it may be
<div n="lb">analyzed so, is indubitable from passages where it occurs
<div n="lb">e. g. in the form {#napAtamapAm#}. On the other hand it must be ob-
<div n="lb">served that the double accent belongs also to other and similar
<div n="lb">Tatpur. mentioned in the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} VI. 2. 140. (comp. e. g.
<div n="lb">{#tanUnapAt#}) and that this Gaṇa would comprise more words
<div n="lb">than those mentioned in the present edition of Pāṇ. and the
<div n="lb">ordinary Gaṇa lists as well as in the Kāśikā, if we may believe
<div n="lb">the {%Svaramañjarī%} of {%Nṛsinha,%} which mentions e. g. {#Sukagra-#}
<div n="lb">{#nTinO#} (not referring this word to VI. 2. 141.) and concludes
<div n="lb">with {#ityAdi;#} it may be observed too, that the {%Nighanṭu%}
<div n="lb">mentions {#apAnnapAt#} as {%one%} of the thirty-two {#pada#} enumerated
<div n="lb">V. 4., and that {%Sāyaṇa%} in his comm. cannot have looked
<div n="lb">upon it otherwise than as a compound when he writes e. g.
<div n="lb">{#apAMnapAtsaMjYako'gniH;#} comp. also the remark of {%Patanjali%}
<div n="lb">s. v. {#apAnnaptf#}. The genitive {%plur.%} as a former part of a com-
<div n="lb">pound, is of rare occurrence, but met with also in other
[Page187-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">compounds beginning with {#apAm,#} e. g. {#apAMvatsa, apAnnATa,#}
<div n="lb">{#apAmpati#} &c. and in the Tatpur. {#devAnAMpriya#} ({%Pāṇini%} VI. 3. 21.
<div n="lb">{%Vārtt.%} 4.). E. {#apAm#} (gen. plur. of {#ap#}) and {#napAt#}.
