<div n="lb">their meaning. {%Mādhava%} quotes in the {%Dhātuvṛ.%} the alleged
<div n="lb">{%Sūtra%} and the simple forms {#amita#} and {#Anta,#} but under
<div n="lb">{#am#} ‘to go, to honour, to sound’, not under {#am#} ‘to be

<div n="lb">in the {%Dhātūparāyaṇa%} {#aByamita#} and {#aByAnta#} under {#am#} ‘to
<div n="lb">sound, to honour’ to which he refers {#am#} ‘to go’, but
<div n="lb">not under {#am#} ‘to be sick’. It will seem therefore, that
<div n="lb">the meaning ‘diseased’ of these participles is a doubtful
<div n="lb">one.--Unless {%Durga'%}s meaning ‘uninjured’ is merely con-
<div n="lb">structive or explanatory of a (possible) meaning ‘attacking’
