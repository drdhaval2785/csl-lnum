{#apravfdDa#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-dDaH-dDA-dDam#}) Not full grown, not
<div n="lb">very large &c.; see the meanings of {#pravfdDa#}. [N. B. This
<div n="lb">word is mentioned in the modern compilation of a comm.
<div n="lb">to {%Pāṇini%} as an instance to the ākritigaṇa {#pravfdDAdi#} (VI. 2.
<div n="lb">147.), when it would be udātta on the last syllable; but it
<div n="lb">occurs neither in the {%Kāśikā,%} nor in the {%Siddhaṇtak.%} and
<div n="lb">its comm., the {%Praudhamanor.,%} nor in {%Nṛsinha'%}s {%Swara-%}
<div n="lb">{%mañjarī;%} and as {%Patanjali%} and his commentators {%Kaiyyata%}
<div n="lb">and {%Nagojibhaṭṭa%} have no gloss on this Sūtra, it becomes
<div n="lb">very doubtful whether the quoted Gaṇa extends to the word
<div n="lb">{#pravfdDa#} in composition with the neg. {#a#}.] E. {#a#} neg. and {#pravfdDa#}.
