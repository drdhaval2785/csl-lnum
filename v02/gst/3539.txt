{#anUpa#}¦ I. 1. Bahuvr. 1. m. f. n. ({#-paH-pA-pam#}) Watery, rich in
<div n="lb">water. 2. m. ({#-paH#}) (Used in a comm. of the Rāmāyaṇa also
<div n="lb">as a neuter: {#-pam#}.) <sup>1</sup> A moist country. According to the di-
<div n="lb">vision of the medical Ātreya-Sanhitā one of the three cli-
<div n="lb">mates of India--see besides {#jANgala#} and {#sADAraRa;#} it is
<div n="lb">defined in Wise's Hindu system of Medicine as having much
<div n="lb">water on its surface, being intersected by rivers and irregular
<div n="lb">in its surface, with high mountains and tall trees; the air
<div n="lb">being there cool and the wind temperate; abounding in
<div n="lb">grass, water flowers, geese, ducks, cranes, fish, serpents &c.,
<div n="lb">unhealthy and its inhabitants being fat, indolent and weak.
<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> (ved.) A jar ({#kalaSa#}). <sup>3</sup> The name of a country (mentioned
<div n="lb">f. i. amongst those conquered by Rudradāman, one of the
<div n="lb">Sinha-kings).
<div n="P">2. Tatpur. m. ({#-paH#}) <sup>1</sup> A buffalo. [<sup>2</sup> Any animal living
<div n="lb">in the water or on shore. <sup>3</sup> The francoline partridge ({#ti-#}
<div n="lb">{#ttiraka#}). <sup>4</sup> An elephant. <sup>5</sup> A frog ({#plava#}). <sup>6</sup> Any shelled
<div n="lb">animal which lives in the water. <sup>7</sup> An amphibious animal.
<div n="lb"><sup>8</sup> A fish. (The last seven meanings are given on the authority
<div n="lb">of several medical authors.)] <sup>9</sup> A proper name, an abbre-
<div n="lb">viation of {#anUpasiMha#} q. v. See {#anUpavilAsa#}. E. {#anu#} and
<div n="lb">{#ap,#} changed, according to Pāṇini, to {#Up,#} samāsānta aff.
<div n="lb">{#a#} (the affix being the same in the Tatpur. and the Bahuvr.,
<div n="lb">according to the Kāśikā), but as regards the change of the
<div n="lb">vowel, it is more probable that {#a#} of {#ap#} has got lost and
<div n="lb">the preceding vowel lengthened by way of compensation,
<div n="lb">analogously to {#samIpa, pratIpa, dvIpa, vIpa#} &c. In {#darBAnUpa#}
<div n="lb">q. v. the {#n#} is not changed to {#R#}.
<div n="P">II. Tatpur. m. ({#-paH#}) (ved.) Throwing or effusing in re-
[Page110-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">gular succession or according to (scil. one's functions); an
<div n="lb">epithet of the three divinities Parjanya, Vāyu and Āditya
<div n="lb">‘who effuse on the earth (i. e. produce there) rain, cold and
<div n="lb">heat successively or according to their functions’ (accord.
<div n="lb">to Yāska and Sāyaṇa). E. {#vap#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#ac(?),#}
<div n="lb">but it is better perhaps to assume that this {#anUpa#} means
<div n="lb">originally ‘favourable, propitious’ and comes from {#anu#} and
<div n="lb">{#ap,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#}. For the latter etym. see the Preface.
