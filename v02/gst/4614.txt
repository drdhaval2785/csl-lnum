{#apadiSam#}¦ Avyayībh. Between two regions of the compass
<div n="lb">(as south-east &c.). [The {%Siddhāntakaum.%} appears to assume
<div n="lb">also a neuter {#apadiSa (-Sam)#} ‘intermediate space of the
<div n="lb">compass’, since it explains {#apadiSam#} as representing the
<div n="lb">value of the instrum. or locative of {#apadiSa#} viz. {#‘apadiSam .#}
<div n="lb">{#apadiSena . apadiSam . apadiSe’;#} but the comm. on the
<div n="lb">{%Amarak.%} I. 1. 2. 7. take the words {#‘klIvAvyayam’#} mentioned
<div n="lb">there, expressly as meaning ‘Avyayībh.’ and as imparting
<div n="lb">moreover to {#apa#} in {#apadiSam#} the meaning ‘in the middle of’.
<div n="lb">{%Svāmin%} explains {#apadiSam#} as representing the value of a
<div n="lb">case of {#diS#} (comp. Pāṇ. II. 1. 6), but {%Bhanūjid.%} refutes
<div n="lb">him in contending that the word could not imply then the
<div n="lb">notion of ‘in the middle of’: {#‘diSoridamapadiSaM viBaktyarTe#}
<div n="lb">{#'vyayIBAva iti svAmI . tanna . saMbanDamAtrasya viBaktyarTatve'pi#}
<div n="lb">{#maDyasya tadarTatvABAvAt’#}.--It seems unnecessary, however,
[Page163-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">to create a new meaning of {#apa#} on account of this com-
<div n="lb">pound, as {#apadiSam#} could well signify literally ‘away from
<div n="lb">one region and another’ i. e. between both. For a similar
<div n="lb">interpretation of {#apa#} comp. {#apasalavi#}.] E. {#apa#} and {#diS,#}
<div n="lb">samās. aff. {#wac,#} or {#apa#} and {#diSA#}.
