{#anyaTAsidDi#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-dDiH#}) I. (In the Vaiśeṣika philosophy.)
<div n="lb">The being wrongly established or the establishing wrongly,
<div n="lb">i. e. the being referred of an effect, or the referring an effect,
<div n="lb">to a cause which is not the true cause. This may happen
<div n="lb">in five ways, viz. <sup>a.</sup> by taking for cause what is prior to
<div n="lb">the effect but only accidental to the real cause ({#‘saha tena’#}),
<div n="lb">as by taking a potter's stick for the cause of a jar; or
<div n="lb"><sup>b.</sup> by taking for cause something inherent to what is ac-
<div n="lb">cidental to the real cause ({#‘yasya’#}), as by taking the shape
<div n="lb">of a potter's stick for the cause of a jar; or <sup>c.</sup> by taking
<div n="lb">for cause what is prior but is known to be the cause of
<div n="lb">another effect ({#‘anyaM prati’#}), as by taking æther for the cause
<div n="lb">of a jar, æther being the known cause of sound; or <sup>d.</sup> by
<div n="lb">taking for cause what is prior but prior in so far only as
<div n="lb">the real cause is produced by it ({#‘janakaM prati’#}), as by tak-
<div n="lb">ing the potter's father for the cause of a jar; or <sup>e.</sup> by taking
<div n="lb">for cause any thing foreign to the effect ({#‘atiriktam’#}), as
<div n="lb">by taking the donkey carrying the earth of which the jar is
<div n="lb">made, for the cause of the jar. The last error comprises,
<div n="lb">indeed, in its generality all the preceding and is therefore
<div n="lb">called {#‘AvaSyaka’,#} the absolute error. E. {#anyaTA#} and {#sidDi#}.
<div n="P">II. Not being established or proved otherwise; in the Sān-
<div n="lb">khya Sūtra: {#uBayatrApyanyaTAsidDerna pratyakzamanumAnaM vA#} (comm.
