<div n="lb">would seem as if they looked upon {#aByavadAnya#} not as a
<div n="lb">compound but as representing two distinct words {#aBi#} and
[Page310-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">{#a#} (neg.)--{#vadAnya,#} since the negative {#a#} could otherwise
<div n="lb">not have been recognized by them, in conformity with
<div n="lb">grammar, between {#aBi#} and {#vadAnya#}. Whether this division
<div n="lb">of the word has taken place in the {%Bṛhadār.,%} it is pro-
<div n="lb">bably not possible to say; in the {%Śatap.,%} however, the ac-
<div n="lb">cent shows that {#aByavadAnya#} is {%one%} compound base. But as
<div n="lb">{#aBi#} imparts sometimes a negative sense (‘away’) to the
<div n="lb">latter part of a compound of which it is a former part
<div n="lb">(comp. {#aByaya, aBiharaRa#} &c.), it is more plausible per-
<div n="lb">haps to take {#avadAnya#} as another form of, and equivalent
<div n="lb">in meaning to the shorter and probably older {#vadAnya#} (from
<div n="lb">{#vadAna = avadAna#}), and to analyze therefore: {#aBi#} and
<div n="lb">{#avadAnya#}.
