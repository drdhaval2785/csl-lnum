{#aprARin#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-RI-RinI-Ri#}) Inanimate, lifeless;
<div n="lb">e. g. in {%Manu:%} {#aprARiBiryatkriyate talloke dyUtamucyate#}. (As in
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇini'%}s {%Sūtras%} the neg. {#a#} is sometimes used in compo-
<div n="lb">sition with a noun, when in ordinary writing it would be
<div n="lb">more correct to employ the uncompounded {#na,#} as referring
<div n="lb">to the verb of the sentence, the interpretation of the word
<div n="lb">{#aprARizu#} in VIII. 3. 72. and therefore the bearing of the
<div n="lb">rule itself becomes doubtful; the {%Kāśikā%} takes the Sūtra as
<div n="lb">if it ended: {#na prARizu;#} {%Patanjali%} is less positive, for he ex-
<div n="lb">claims, after showing the possibility of either acceptation:
<div n="lb">{#kiM punaratrArTasatattvam . devA etajjYAtumarhanti;#} but {%Kaiyyaṭa%}
<div n="lb">seems to think that if the gods {%must%} know it, the Paṇḍits may
<div n="lb">have at least an opinion on the matter, viz. that {#aprARizu#} is
<div n="lb">not to be taken there in the sense of {#na prARizu,#} as the unity
<div n="lb">of the Sūtra would become disturbed by such an interpre-
<div n="lb">tation: {#devA iti . paRqitAH paryudAsaM manyante . saMBavatyekavA-#}
<div n="lb">{#kyatve vAkyaBedASrayaRasyAyuktatvAt . prasajyapratizeDe hi vAkyaBe-#}
<div n="lb">{#do'vaSyaMBAvI;#} this latter view is also taken by {%Bhaṭṭojid.%})
<div n="lb">E. {#a#} neg. and {#prARin#}.
