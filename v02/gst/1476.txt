{#atyantatiraskftavAcyaDvani#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-niH#}) (In rhetoric.)
<div n="lb">A metaphorical expression, when the word expressing the fi-
<div n="lb">gure or comparison drops its literal sense in order to be-
<div n="lb">come appropriate for the comparison; f. i. in the sentence
<div n="lb">‘the moon does not shine, like a mirror which has become
<div n="lb">blind by breathing upon it’--the word ‘blind’ loses its
<div n="lb">literal meaning, to serve as a comparison for ‘the not shin-
<div n="lb">ing’ of the moon with which it has no common quality.
<div n="lb">E. {#atyanta, tiraskfta, vAcya#} (these three words forming a
<div n="lb">Bahuvr.) and {#Dvani#}.
