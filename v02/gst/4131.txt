{#annamayakoSa#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-SaH#}) The sheath made of {#anna#} 2. 2.,
<div n="lb">of the essence of the elementary creation, i. e. the material
<div n="lb">creation: the lowest form in which Brahman (n.) or the
<div n="lb">Supreme Soul is considered as manifesting itself in its world-
<div n="lb">ly and conscious existence.--In the Taittirīya-Upan. {#anna#}
<div n="lb">of which the material creation is made, is the product of
<div n="lb">herbs, these of earth and so on in retrogression, of the
<div n="lb">elements water, fire and æther, the latter being the first
<div n="lb">product of the Supreme Soul; it would appear therefore
<div n="lb">that Brahman (n.) as {#annamayakoSa,#} in this Upanishad,
[Page136-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">is the totality of the {%animal kingdom%} only, since the vegetable
<div n="lb">kingdom precedes the creation of {#anna#} which is called also
<div n="lb">{#sarvOzaDa#} (see {#anna#} 2. 2.) and the beings ({#prajAH#} or {#BUtAni#})
<div n="lb">originating in {#anna,#} are represented as {%living%} through it
<div n="lb">({#‘aTo'nenEva jIvanti’#}); but as {#anna#} on the other hand,
<div n="lb">is the essence of the elements preceding it, this form of
<div n="lb">Brahman would become in the Upanishad, constructively,
<div n="lb">the same that it is in the Vedānta explicitly, viz. the to-
<div n="lb">tality of the whole material creation. Yet while the Upa-
<div n="lb">nishad uses the terms æther, air, fire, water and earth to
<div n="lb">denote the elements in a general sense, the Vedānta dis-
<div n="lb">tinguishes between ideal ({#sUkzma#}) and real ({#sTUla#}) elements
<div n="lb">and makes the {#annamayakoSa#} proceed from the latter which
<div n="lb">are an artificial mutual combination of portions of the former
<div n="lb">(see {#BUta, sUkzmaBUta#} and {#sTUlaBUta#}); and while the Upanishad
<div n="lb">contents itself with the general idea of totality, as expressed
<div n="lb">above, the Vedānta distinguishes between the conception
<div n="lb">that may be formed of the Supreme Soul as unity in this
<div n="lb">totality of the material creation (comp. {#samazwi#}) and the con-
<div n="lb">ception that may be formed of it as multiplicity in it (comp.
<div n="lb">{#vyazwi#}); as unity it is called {#vESvAnara#} or {#virAj,#} as multi-
<div n="lb">plicity {#viSva,#} in either case it is {#jAgrat#}.--The forms superior
<div n="lb">to the {#annamayakoSa#} are in successive gradation {#prARamayakoSa,#}
<div n="lb">{#manomayakoSa, vijYAnamayakoSa#} and {#AnandamayakoSa#} qq. vv.
<div n="lb">(the word {#koSa#} being supplied, in the Upanishad, by the
<div n="lb">comm. to {#annamaya#} &c.). Compare also {#sUkzmaSarIra#} and {#sTU-#}
<div n="lb">{#laSarIra#}. E. {#annamaya#} and {#koSa#}. Also written {#annamayakoza#}.
