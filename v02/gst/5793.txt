{#abDija#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-jaH-jA-jam#}) Born in or by the
<div n="lb">ocean.
<div n="P">2. <sup>a.</sup> m. sing. ({#-jaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The moon; comp. {#abja#}. <sup>2</sup> (In

<div n="lb">{#mudraPena#} (according to the {%Nigh. Prak.%}), comp. also {#arRavaja#}.
<div n="lb">(The meaning ‘moon’ is not given in the Koshas; but as
<div n="lb">the word occurs in the second meaning, in a mathematical
<div n="lb">Index, similarly as {#amftadIDiti,#} and as the synonymes
<div n="lb">of {#candra#} q. v. are used likewise so, it seemed to me neces-
<div n="lb">sary to infer this mathematical application from the mean-
<div n="lb">ing ‘moon’, which would arise from the etymon of the
<div n="lb">word in the same way as {#abja#} 2. 1. q. v. Comp. also {#Sve-#}
<div n="lb">{#taDAman#} ‘moon and cuttle fish bone’.)
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> m. du. ({#-jO#}) A name of the Aśvins q. v., these two

<div n="lb">ing come from the ocean when it was churned for the amṛta.
