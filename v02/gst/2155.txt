{#aDvaryu#}¦ m. ({#-ryuH#}) <sup>1</sup> One desirous of having a sacrifice insti-
<div n="lb">tuted for one's self (used in this sense in the Rigveda). <sup>2</sup> A
<div n="lb">priest in general (ved.) <sup>3</sup> (In the ritual and the epic litera-
<div n="lb">ture.) A special priest, one conversant with and performing
<div n="lb">the ritual observances connected with the Yajurveda; he is
<div n="lb">one of the sixteen Ṛtvijs required for the performing of the
<div n="lb">great Soma sacrifices (see {#ftvij#}) and, amongst them,
<div n="lb">one of the four leading priests (see besides {#brahman, udgAtf#}
<div n="lb">and {#hotf#}) who receive the whole dakṣiṇā (q. v.); his pu-
<div n="lb">rushas or assistant priests are the {#pratiprasTAtf, nezwwa#} and
<div n="lb">{#unnetf#} who are called, like himself, the {#dIkzayitf#} (q. v.) because
<div n="lb">they initiate, viz. the {#aDvaryu#} the three other leading priests,
<div n="lb">the {#pratiprasTAtf#} the {#arDin-#} (q. v.), the {#nezwf#} the {#tftIyin-#}
<div n="lb">(q. v.) and the {#unnetf#} the {#pAdin-#} (q. v.) priests. The Mi-
<div n="lb">mānsā decides in doubtful cases, viz. whenever a sacrifice
<div n="lb">mentioned in and making part of the ritual of the Yajur-
<div n="lb">veda, is mentioned also and forms part of another Veda,
<div n="lb">whether the Adhwaryu has another priest to share in
<div n="lb">his functions or whether he has to abstain from the pro-
<div n="lb">ceedings altogether. The ten {#camasADvaryu#} (q. v.), who,
<div n="lb">are also assistants or purushas of the Adhwaryu, are dis-
<div n="lb">tinct from and do not bear the name of Ṛtvij.--According
<div n="lb">to a legend in the Harivanśa, Nārāyaṇa created the first
<div n="lb">Adhwaryu from his arms. The dual {#aDvaryu#} is the collective
<div n="lb">denomination of the {#aDvaryu#} and {#pratiprasTAtf,#} his principal
<div n="lb">assistant; the plur. {#aDvaryavaH#} of the {#aDvaryu#} and his three
<div n="lb">assistants, and in general of those devoted to the study or
<div n="lb">the practice of the Yajurveda. <sup>4</sup> The Yajurveda (also in the
<div n="lb">plur. {#aDvaryavaH#}). E. {#aDvary,#} kṛt aff. {#u#}.
