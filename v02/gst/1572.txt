{#aTarvI#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-vI#}). This word occurs only in the Veda
<div n="lb">and is explained ‘not going, unable to move’, from {#a#}
<div n="lb">neg. and {#TarvI#} (from {#Tarv,#} to go). It would seem, how-
<div n="lb">ever, that it is a Tatpur. composed of the obsolete word
<div n="lb">{#aTar,#} fire, and {#vI,#} ‘surrounded by fire’(?). See the E.
<div n="lb">of {#aTarvan#} and {#aTarI#}.
