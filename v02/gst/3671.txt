{#antaHkaraRa#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-Ram#}) (In Philosophy.) <sup>1</sup> The interior
<div n="lb">sense (also called {#AByantarakaraRa#}) opposed to the {#vAhyakaraRa#}
<div n="lb">(q. v.) or exterior sense; this notion which in general may
<div n="lb">be termed {%‘the faculty of thinking’%} is thus modified in the
<div n="lb">Vedānta and in the Sāṅkhya: <sup>a</sup> (In the Vedānta it implies)
<div n="lb">the notion of what is the general substratum of {#Atman#} or
<div n="lb">Soul (Śaṅkara: {#taccAtmana upADiBUtamantaHkaraRam#}); its activity
<div n="lb">becomes manifest in two of the seventeen {#sUkzmaSarIra#} (q. v.)
<div n="lb">or subtle bodies of creation, viz. in the {#budDi#} (q. v.) or that
<div n="lb">mental activity which forms positive conclusions, and in
<div n="lb">the {#manas,#} or that mental activity which ‘discerns and doubts’;
[Page115-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">and as {#citta#} or ‘logical combination’ is involved by the
<div n="lb">activity of {#budDi,#} and {#ahaNkAra#} or ‘self-consciousness’ is in-
<div n="lb">volved by {#manas,#} the activity of the {#antaHkaraRa#} is fourfold,
<div n="lb">viz. as that of {#budDi, manas, citta#} and {#ahaNkAra#}. Śaṅkara in
<div n="lb">his commentary on the Vedānta Sūtras varies slightly in this
<div n="lb">respect by substituting {#vijYAna#} for {#ahaNkAra;#} the difference
<div n="lb">however is merely apparent, {#vijYAna,#} worldly knowledge,
<div n="lb">being also one of the attributes of {#manas#} (Śaṅkara: {#‘antaH-#}
<div n="lb">{#karaRaM mano budDirvijYAnaM cittamiti cAnekaDA tatra tatrABi-#}
<div n="lb">{#lapyate’#}). <sup>b.</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya it is not the substratum of {#puruza#}
<div n="lb">or Soul but) the generic name and characteristic of three
<div n="lb">successive productions of {#prakfti#} or Matter, viz. of {#budDi#} ‘as-
<div n="lb">certainment or positive conclusion’, of its product {#ahaNkAra#}
<div n="lb">self-consciousness’ and of the product of Ahaṅkāra, viz.
<div n="lb">{#manas#} which in this philosophy means ‘an organ both of sen-
<div n="lb">sation and of action’ (see {#budDIndriya#} and {#karmendriya#}), ‘the
<div n="lb">organ of volition’ (see {#saNkalpa#}). ‘The ten external organs
<div n="lb">(viz the five organs of sensation and the five of action)
<div n="lb">supply the objects for the ‘interior sense’, their time is the
<div n="lb">present time, while the interior sense embraces the past,
<div n="lb">present and future time’. <sup>2</sup> (In the non-philosophical lite-
<div n="lb">rature where philosophical terms are usually employed in
<div n="lb">a vague manner, this word means) Mind, heart, feeling,
<div n="lb">a synonyme of {#manas#} in its vague, unphilosophical sense;
<div n="lb">e. g. (in a verse of the Mālatīmādhava where an apparent
<div n="lb">show is made of philosophical accuracy) {#premArdrAH praRayaspf-#}
<div n="lb">{#SaH…cezwA Baveyurmayi . yAsvantaHkaraRasya vAhyakaraRavyApA-#}
<div n="lb">{#raroDIkzaRAdASaMsAparikalpitAsvapi BavatyAnandasAndrodayaH#}
<div n="lb">(var. lect. {#°sAndro layaH#})--E. {#antar#} and {#karaRa#}.
