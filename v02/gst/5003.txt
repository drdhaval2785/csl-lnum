{#apasmAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) (In Medicine.) Epilepsy, falling
<div n="lb">sickness; according to {%Suśruta,%} of four kinds, the three
<div n="lb">first produced by the derangement of air, bile and phlegm,
<div n="lb">the fourth by the combination of the three. (A definition
<div n="lb">of {%Ātreya%} is: {#pittaM raktaM marucCezmA udAnaH kupito BfSam .#}
<div n="lb">{#prARaH Sirasi saMkupya kurute nazwacezwatAm#}.) In Rhetoric it is
<div n="lb">mentioned as a {#vyaBicAriBAva#} or an accessory condition of
<div n="lb">the Erotic ({#SfNgAra#}), Pathetic ({#karuRa#}), the Fearful ({#BayAnaka#})
<div n="lb">and the Disgustful ({#bIBatma#}), and is defined--but happily
<div n="lb">this definition has not guided the Hindu poets in the re-
<div n="lb">presentation of their characters--as ‘dementation caused
<div n="lb">by the planets or similar evil influences and causing falls,
<div n="lb">trembling, perspiration, foaming at the mouth, slavering
<div n="lb">&c.’. E. {#smf#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
