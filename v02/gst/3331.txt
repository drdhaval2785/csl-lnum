{#anuvAda#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-daH#}) <sup>1</sup> Reference or referring to what
<div n="lb">has been previously said, not in the way of a mere repetition
<div n="lb">or tautology, but in that of explanation, detailed comment
<div n="lb">or emphasis; explanatory and corroborative reference, ex-
<div n="lb">planation; e. g. {#BUpariDimAnAnuvAdaH#} ‘a detailed explanation
<div n="lb">with reference to the measure of the earth's circumference
<div n="lb">(mentioned before in the Golādhyāya)’; or, in Manu 2. 53.
<div n="lb">the words {#KAni saMspfSet#} are an {#anuvAda#} to {#nivedya#} &c. 2. 51.,
<div n="lb">because they give a detailed illustration of the general in-
<div n="lb">junction contained in the latter verse. If a word is repeated
<div n="lb">or an expression used which would seem superfluous, be-
<div n="lb">cause not conveying a new notion, such repeated word or
[Page103-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">such expression is {#anuvAda,#} provided a certain purpose be
<div n="lb">connected with it, otherwise it would be simply {#punarukta#} or
<div n="lb">a meaningless tautology, e. g. {#Gawo GawaH#} or {#GawaH kalasaH#} ‘a
<div n="lb">jar is a jar’ would be a {#punarukta;#} but the repetition of {#paSyet#}
<div n="lb">in Yājnav. 2. 1. from 1. 359. is an {#anuvAdaH#} because it points
<div n="lb">to the connexion between both passages and to the detail
<div n="lb">which is to follow as an illustration of 1. 359.; or in Manu
<div n="lb">1. 72. {#parisaMKyayA#} might be taken as an {#anuvAda#} to {#sahasraM,#}
<div n="lb">because it imparts greater emphasis to the bare numeral.
<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> In the ritual literature {#anuvAda#} designates those passages
<div n="lb">of the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Vedas, which point to an
<div n="lb">injunction given before ({#viDi#} q. v.) and illustrate it by the
<div n="lb">way of comment, or by entering into greater detail, or by
<div n="lb">adding supplementary rules, but without stating the purpose
<div n="lb">of the injunction itself as the latter would be the object of
<div n="lb">the {#arTavAda#} (q. v.); the {#anuvAda#} being accessory, therefore,
<div n="lb">to the {#viDi#} portion of the Brāhmaṇa and precluded from
<div n="lb">giving independent regulations, the supplementary rites they
<div n="lb">contain are not considered of equal weight and as absolute
<div n="lb">as those of the {#viDi;#} there exists however sometimes a
<div n="lb">difficulty to decide whether a passage of the Brāhmaṇas is
<div n="lb">{#viDi#} or {#anuvAda,#} or in other words whether its injunctions
<div n="lb">are absolute or not, as appears from the discussion of the
<div n="lb">Mīmānsists. (The Nyāya, supported by the commentaries
<div n="lb">on the Mīmānsā, distribute the text of the Brāhmaṇa under
<div n="lb">the three heads of {#viDi, anuvAda#} and {#arTavAda#} qq. vv.; a
<div n="lb">later division makes {#anuvAda#} one of the three categories
<div n="lb">of the {#arTavAda#}.) <sup>3</sup> Report, e. g. {#kutsitArTAnuvAdaH#}. <sup>4</sup> Abuse,
<div n="lb">reviling (? this meaning is given by several dictionaries on
<div n="lb">the authority of the Śabdaratnāvalī, but, to judge from
<div n="lb">the Mss. at my disposal, it would seem to proceed from
<div n="lb">another reading or from a misunderstanding of the passage
<div n="lb">of this work which contains the synonymes of ‘rumour’:
<div n="lb">{#yaTArTAniScitA vArttA BavetsarvajanAtmikA . kutsitArTAnuvAdo#}
<div n="lb">{#vA kiMvadantI janaSrutiH ..;#} the same might be said of the
<div n="lb">meanings ‘abusive reply’ and ‘divulging another's misdeeds’
<div n="lb">which occur also in some dictionaries). E. {#vad#} with {#anu,#}
<div n="lb">kṛt aff. {#GaY#} or {#anu#} and {#vAda#}.
