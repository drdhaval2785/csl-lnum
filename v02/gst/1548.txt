{#aTa#}¦ ind. An inceptive and auspicious particle. It serves to
<div n="lb">introduce the beginning of a work, a chapter, a sentence
<div n="lb">and with respect to the latter may imply doubt or inter-
<div n="lb">rogation or may serve as a conjunctive or disjunctive par-
<div n="lb">ticle. It may be accompanied by those particles or words
<div n="lb">which themselves are used in the same sense, giving them
<div n="lb">greater emphasis, especially by {#u, atas, anantaram, kim,#}
<div n="lb">{#tu, punar, vA, kimu, api#}. Without or with these particles
<div n="lb">{#aTa#} corresponds therefore with: <sup>1</sup> Now (inceptive or pre-
<div n="lb">mising); in the same sense but with greater emphasis {#aTo#}
<div n="lb">({#aTa#} and {#u#}), {#aTAtas, aTAnantaram#}. <sup>2</sup> Why? what? (in-
<div n="lb">terrogatively and doubtingly); (likewise {#aTavA#}.) <sup>3</sup> How
<div n="lb">else? certainly; (in the same sense {#aTakim#}.) <sup>4</sup> But, on the
<div n="lb">contrary; (in the same sense {#aTa tu, aTa punar#}.) <sup>5</sup> Or, or
<div n="lb">rather; (likewise {#aTavA, aTavApi, aTApi vA#} &c.) <sup>6</sup> More-
<div n="lb">over, so much the more, therefore, thus; (likewise {#aTaca,#}
<div n="lb">{#aTApi, aTo api, aTa kimu#}.) In the Vedas there occurs
<div n="lb">also the protracted form {#aTA#} which seems to be the more
<div n="lb">original one; (cf. {#taTA#} and {#yaTA#}). E. According to the native
<div n="lb">authorities from {#arT,#} kṛt aff. {#qa#} with {#r#} being dropped;
<div n="lb">but it is more probably derived from {#a,#} the pron. theme
<div n="lb">which is considered as a substitute for {#idam#} (pointing to
<div n="lb">what follows), taddh. aff. {#Ta#}.
