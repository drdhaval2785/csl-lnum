{#adadryaYc#}Â¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-dryaN-drIcI-dryak#}) Going to that.
<div n="lb">(This word is probably one of a mere grammatical coinage,
<div n="lb">to illustrate a rule concerning the pronom. theme {#adas#}.
<div n="lb">According to some it would have the same meaning as {#a-#}
<div n="lb">{#damuyaYc, amudryaYc#} and {#amumuyaYc#} to which others add {#ada-#}
<div n="lb">{#mudryaYc, amumUyaYc, adamUyaYc#} qq. vv., but it might also be
<div n="lb">that {#adadryaYc#} (as well as {#adamuyaYc, adamudryaYc, adamUyaYc#})
<div n="lb">is formed to show that its first part represents not the
<div n="lb">whole theme, but merely the neuter of {#adas,#} while the
<div n="lb">first part of {#amudryaYc, amumuyaYc#} and {#amumUyaYc#} refer to its
<div n="lb">masc. and femin. For the declension of this word, see
<div n="lb">{#aYc#} II. E. {#adas#} and {#aYc#} (II. 1.), with {#adri#} instead of
<div n="lb">the final {#as#} of {#adas#}.
