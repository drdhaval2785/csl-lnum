{#anyo'nya#}¦ (usually written {#anyonya#}) Tatpur. (see {#sarvanAman#})
<div n="lb">1. m. f. n. ({#-nyaH-nyA-nyam,#} not. {#anyonyad;#} in the other cases
<div n="lb">it follows the declension of {#anya#} q. v.) One-another, mutual.--
<div n="lb"><sup>a.</sup> The verb in connexion with {#anyonya#} stands (acc. to Pāṇ.) in
<div n="lb">the Parasmaipada, not in the Ātmanepada; e. g. {#anyonyasya#}
<div n="lb">{#vyatipunanti, anyonyasya vyatilunanti#}.--<sup>b.</sup> If {#anyonya#} refers
<div n="lb">to the subject of the sentence and the subject is a mascu-
<div n="lb">line, it is possible to consider it as consisting of two dis-
<div n="lb">tinct not compound words {#anya,#} the former being a nomi-
<div n="lb">native as attribute to the subject, while the latter assumes
<div n="lb">the case required by the sentence (see the Etym.); e. g.
<div n="lb">{#anyo'nyamAhvayantO tu mattAviva mahAgajO;#} or {#te'nyonyamaBi-#}
<div n="lb">{#saMsftya kzipanto nAmaBirmiTaH;#} or {#…kapirAkzasAH . anyo'nyenA-#}
<div n="lb">{#ByasUyanta vimardamasahanta ca;#} or in sentences in which the gerond
<div n="lb">is used elliptically; e. g. {#tAByAmanyo'nyamAsAdya samavApyata saM-#}
<div n="lb">{#SamaH#}.--<sup>c.</sup> There are however many instances in which
<div n="lb">{#anyonya#} does not refer to the subject, or in which it is the
<div n="lb">attribute of a subject which is not a masculine and there-
<div n="lb">fore cannot be looked upon otherwise than as a compound;
<div n="lb">e. g. {#anyonyena kftam;#} or {#anyonyasmE dattam;#} or {#anyonyezAM pu-#}
<div n="lb">{#zkarErAmfSanto dAnodBedAduccakErBugnavAlAH;#} or as an attribute
<div n="lb">of a neuter {#prItyaprItivizAdAdyErguRAnAmanyonyaM vEDarmyam;#} and
<div n="lb">the same must be observed of all the words in which {#anyonya#}
<div n="lb">is the first part of a compound; comp. e. g. the following
<div n="lb">articles and {#anyonyatas#}. <sup>d.</sup> {#anyonyam#} is frequently used ad-
<div n="lb">verbially, e. g. {#yadyapyAtmanAmanyonyaM BedavAkyavadaBedavAkyAnyapi#}
<div n="lb">{#santi taTApi nAdvEtaM nAtyantamaBedaH.--anyonyam#} or {#anyonyAm#}
<div n="lb">are used optionally in the sense of an accusative, if the
<div n="lb">subject to which they refer is either a feminine or a neuter;
<div n="lb">e. g. {#anyonyamime brAhmaRyO BojayataH#} or--{#anyonyAM BojayataH;#}
<div n="lb">{#anyonyamime brAhmaRakule BojayataH#} or--{#anyonyAM BojayataH;#}
<div n="lb">these are the instances given by Patanjali on the Vārttika
<div n="lb">12 to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12, and because they show either word
<div n="lb">as representing in meaning the accus. of {#anyonya,#} some
<div n="lb">grammarians (‘of the East’, according to the Prauḍhama-
<div n="lb">noramā on the same rule) contend that the option is re-
<div n="lb">stricted to the meaning of this case, but that {#anyonyam#} alone
<div n="lb">is admissible when expressing adverbially the sense of the
<div n="lb">other cases. Others, on the contrary, maintain that the quoted
<div n="lb">words are intended by Patanjali merely as an instance and
<div n="lb">that the option extends also to sentences in which {#anyonyam#}
<div n="lb">would imply the sense of an instrumental &c. Bhaṭṭoji, re-
<div n="lb">ferring in the Siddh. Kaum. on the quoted rule to Patanjali's
<div n="lb">gloss on the 5th Bhāṣyakārikā to Pāṇ. IV. 1. 3, sides with
<div n="lb">the former opinion. (Prauḍham. {#yadapi tftIyAdizu puMvaditi#}
<div n="lb">{#prAco granTaM vyAcakzARA AhuH . tftIyAdizu puMvadBAvaviSezaH .#}
<div n="lb">{#tena wAp na . atra tftIyAdizvavivakzitam . dvitIyAyAmapi puM-#}
[Page148-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">{#vattvasyezwatvAditi . taccintyam . puMvattvaM viSeza iti viSezABiDA-#}
<div n="lb">{#namavivakzitamiti ca svokteH . parasparavyADAt . mUlakftA puMva-#}
<div n="lb">{#dBAvasyAspfzwatvAt . tadgranTasyAYjasyenEva vyAKyAtatvAcceti dik ..#});
<div n="lb">Jayamangala, however (in the printed ed. of the Bhaṭṭikāvya)
<div n="lb">differs materially from either of the quoted authorities; for in
<div n="lb">his comment on Bhaṭṭik. 8. 6. he not merely quotes apparently
<div n="lb">a Vārttika which varies in important points from that of Pa-
<div n="lb">tanjali, but justifies {#anyonyam#} of the text by adding: {#strInapuM-#}
<div n="lb">{#sakayorAmaBAva iti vaktavyam#} ‘if the subject is a feminine or a
<div n="lb">neuter, the form {#anyonyAm#} is not admissible’ (the subject of
<div n="lb">the commented sentence being {#udanvAn#} and the femin. {#rA-#}
<div n="lb">{#kzasI#}); yet the correctness of the printed text alluded to is
<div n="lb">very doubtful; for the E. I. H. Ms. 544 reads this comm. thus:
<div n="lb">{#anyonyamityAdi . anyonyamityasyetyarTaH . karmavyatIhAre sarvanA-#}
<div n="lb">{#mnI dvirBavataH . samAsavacca bahulam . yadA samAsavattadA pUrvapa-#}
<div n="lb">{#dasya praTamEkavacanam . uttarapadasyAmBAva iti vAcyam . anyo-#}
<div n="lb">{#nyasaMbanDiBiH SabdEH#} &c. &c. (Comp. also the comm. on Bhaṭṭ.
<div n="lb">1. 21.)--As regards the classical literature there can be no
<div n="lb">doubt that the adverbial use of {#anyonyam#} prevails almost ex-
<div n="lb">clusively over that of {#anyonyAm#}. <sup>e.</sup> The Gaṇaratnamaho-
<div n="lb">dadhi (which mentions {#anyonya#} among the {#sarvanAman#} q. v.) gives
<div n="lb">{#anyonyasya#} in the Gaṇa {#cAdi,#} imparting to the genitive the
<div n="lb">value of an adverb or that of {#anyonyam;#} but the instance,
<div n="lb">Vardhamāna gives in his comm. on this work, {#‘anyonyasya#}
<div n="lb">{#smaranti’#} is not happy, as the genitive could be the legitimate
<div n="lb">government of {#smaranti; ‘anyonyasya Bojayanti’,#} the instance
<div n="lb">of the Kāśikā to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12. Vārtt. 11; {#‘anyonyasya vya-#}
<div n="lb">{#tipunanti’#} of Patanjali to Pāṇ. III. 1. 16. and {#‘anyonyasya#}
<div n="lb">{#vyatilunanti’#} of the Kāś. to the same rule, seem more to the
<div n="lb">purpose; but the occurence of the genitive in the sense of
<div n="lb">other cases is, in general, rare.--Comp. {#itaretara#} and {#paraspara#}.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-nyam#}) (In Rhetoric.) An {#alaMkAra#} q. v. or mode
<div n="lb">of elegant expression; viz. conveying the mutual relation
<div n="lb">or intimacy of two objects by representing them as the
<div n="lb">mutual cause of the same action ({#‘arTayorekakriyAmuKena#}
<div n="lb">{#parasparaM kAraRatve satyanyonyaM nAmAlaMkAraH’#}), e. g. ‘she shineth
<div n="lb">through thee and thou shinest through her, like as the
<div n="lb">moon shineth through the night and the night shineth through
<div n="lb">the moon’. E. {#anyas#} and {#anya#}. [The oldest grammatical
<div n="lb">authorities do not consider {#anyonya#} as a compound, but
<div n="lb">take {#anyonyena#} and other cases as consisting of the two dis-
<div n="lb">tinct words: the nomin. of {#anya#} and the instrum. of {#anya#}
<div n="lb">&c.; see Vārtt. 11 to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12. and the remark of
<div n="lb">Kaiyyaṭa: {#tatra bahulagrahaRAdanyonyaSabde samAsavadBAvABAvA-#}
<div n="lb">{#tsubluNga Bavati . nApi samAsAntodAttatvamityAmreqitAnudA-#}
<div n="lb">{#ttatvaM Bavati#} (comp. Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 3); but it results from the
<div n="lb">foregoing statement that this etym. cannot be entertained.
<div n="lb">Jayamangala on the Bhaṭṭikāvya 17. 8. appears to consider
<div n="lb">{#anyonya#} not as a Tatpur., but as Karmadh. (in explaining
<div n="lb">{#anyonyam#} by {#‘anyasya anyasya’#}), probably in thinking of Pāṇ.
<div n="lb">VIII. 1. 11. which applies to VIII. 1. 12; but the possibility
<div n="lb">of this application is removed by the quoted words of
<div n="lb">Kaiyyaṭa and by the general remark he appends to the
<div n="lb">Vārttikas of VIII. 1. 12, viz. {#vArtikezu karmaDArayavaditi na#}
<div n="lb">{#saMbaDyata iti sublopAdi na Bavati#}. A modern theory takes
<div n="lb">{#anyonya#} for a compound (it does not say which), but calls
[Page149-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">the former part of this word a ‘benumbed’ nominative. It
<div n="lb">seems, however, that the sense and accent of the word (it is
<div n="lb">udātta on the second syllable) decide in the first place for
<div n="lb">its being a Tatpur., and secondly its form, that it belongs
<div n="lb">to that class of compounds in which the former part has
<div n="lb">received a further developement by means of an affix {#s,#}
<div n="lb">the function of which {#s#} apparently consists in producing a
<div n="lb">stronger relation between the two parts of the compound and
<div n="lb">consequently a more intense unity of notion, than would be
<div n="lb">expressed without this {#s;#} comp. e. g. the derivatives of
<div n="lb">{#sam-kf#} and {#saMs-kf, pari-kf#} and {#pariz-kf, apa-kF#} and {#apas-#}
<div n="lb">{#kF; A-carya#} and {#AS-carya, apa-kara#} and {#apas-kara#} &c. and
<div n="lb">such words as {#hariS-candra, ajas-tunda, bfhas-pati, prAyaS-#}
<div n="lb">{#citti#} &c. &c. (comp. Pāṇ. VI. 1. 135-157.) which resemble closely
<div n="lb">in formation {#anyo'nya#} (and the synon. {#paraspara#}); the accent of
<div n="lb">this word would then fall under the category of Pāṇ. VI. 2. 2.]
