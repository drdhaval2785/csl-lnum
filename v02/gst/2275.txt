<div n="lb">neck they make it very feverish and painful and it sup-
<div n="lb">presses the humours particularly in the region of the eyes,
<div n="lb">eyebrows and temples; it then produces shaking in the
<div n="lb">sides of the cheeks, cramp of the jaws and morbid affec-
<div n="lb">tions of the eyes’. E. {#ananta#} and {#vAta#}.
