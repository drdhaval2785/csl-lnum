{#anEkAntika#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-kaH-kA-kam#}) (In Philosophy.)
<div n="lb">Indeterminate, going astray, non-absolute.--In the Nyāya
<div n="lb">and Vaiśeṣika philosophies a quality which constitutes one
<div n="lb">of the five {#hetvABAsa#} (q. v.) or semblances of reason; in the
<div n="lb">Nyāya it is also called {#savyaBicAra#}. A ‘semblance of reason’
<div n="lb">‘goes astray’ or is ‘indeterminate’, if the argument is either
<div n="lb">too general ({#sADAraRa#}) i. e. if it may be applied to the sub-
<div n="lb">ject of conclusion and to an opposite one; e. g. ‘sound is
<div n="lb">eternal, because it is not the object of touch’ or ‘the hearth
<div n="lb">smokes, because it is fiery’; or not general enough ({#asA-#}
<div n="lb">{#DAraRa#}) i. e. if it is excluded from either; e. g. ‘sound is
<div n="lb">eternal because it has the properties of sound’; or non-ex-
<div n="lb">clusive ({#anupasaMhArin#}) i. e. if the major may be predicated
<div n="lb">of any other notion; e. g. ‘every thing is eternal because
<div n="lb">it can be measured’ or ‘every thing can be named because
<div n="lb">it can be inferred’. E. {#a#} neg. and {#EkAntika#}.
