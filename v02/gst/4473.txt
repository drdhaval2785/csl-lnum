I. {#apa#}¦ ind. (see {#nipAta, upasarga, gati, karmapravacanIya#}) A par-
<div n="lb">ticle implying the notion of ‘away’, in its literal and me-
<div n="lb">taphorical acceptations; it is used either as a prefix to verbs
<div n="lb">(and in this capacity, in the Vedas also detached from the
<div n="lb">verb, very much in the same manner as German prepositions
<div n="lb">when connected with verbs), or as a separable preposition,
<div n="lb">or in the Vedas sometimes also adverbially. With nouns it
<div n="lb">may form Tatpur., Bahuvr. and Avyayībh. compounds. [In
<div n="lb">many instances {#ava#} (q. v.) coincides in meaning with {#apa#}
<div n="lb">and in several also the prefix {#A#} q. v.]
<div n="P">1. (as adverb in the Vedas) Away; e. g. {#apa dvezo apa#}
<div n="lb">{#hvaro'nyavratasya saScima#} (comm.: ‘scil. {#gacCatu#}’).
<div n="P">2. (as a prefix to verbs it implies the notion of) <sup>1</sup> Away;
<div n="lb">e. g. with {#nI#} ‘to lead away’; with {#gam#} ‘to go away’;
<div n="lb">with {#hf#} ‘to take away, to rob’. <sup>2</sup> Deterioration; e. g. with
<div n="lb">{#kf#} ‘to act improperly, to injure’; with {#diS#} ‘to simulate’;
<div n="lb">with {#vad#} ‘to blame’. <sup>3</sup> Negation, contradiction; e. g. with
<div n="lb">{#lap#} ‘to deny’; with {#man#} ‘to behave the reverse of respect-
<div n="lb">fully, to despise; with {#ci#} ‘to diminish’; if the base itself
<div n="lb">implies a negative notion, the prefix {#apa#} imparts to it fre-
<div n="lb">quently greater emphasis, e. g. with {#han, trap, hnu#}.
<div n="P">3. (as a separable preposition with a noun depending
<div n="lb">on it in the ablative) <sup>1</sup> Away from; e. g. {#yatsaMpratyapa loke-#}
<div n="lb">{#Byo laNkAyAM vasatirBayAt#}. <sup>2</sup> Without; e. g. {#apa hareH saMsAraH#}
<div n="lb"><sup>3</sup> With the exception of; e. g. {#apa trigarteByo vfzwo devaH#}.
<div n="P">4. (in composition with nouns <sup>a.</sup> in Tatpur. and Bahuvr.
[Page157-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">compounds it implies the same meanings as the prefix to
<div n="lb">verbs, the notion of negation becoming in the Bahuvr. that
<div n="lb">of privation; <sup>b.</sup> in Avyayībh. compounds: <sup>1</sup> Away from;
<div n="lb">comp. {#apasalavi#} and {#apadiSam,#} and the explan. of the
<div n="lb">comm. {%‘between’.%} <sup>2</sup> Without; e. g. {#apavizRu saMsAraH#}. <sup>3</sup> With
<div n="lb">the exception of; e. g. {#apatrigaMrtaM vfzwo devaH#}. <sup>4</sup> Negation,
<div n="lb">contradiction; e. g. {#apakAmam#}. [As upapada before {#sTA,#}
<div n="lb">{#apa#} has in a few derivations of this radical the influence
<div n="lb">of changing its initial {#s#} into {#z;#} see {#apazWa, apazWu, apazWura,#}
<div n="lb">{#apazWula#}.--In the Ṛgveda {#apa#} occurs in its protracted form
<div n="lb">{#apA#} before {#vfDi,#} and in composition with such derivatives
<div n="lb">of {#vf#} as retain the vowel {#f#} of the radical, see {#apAvfta,#}
<div n="lb">{#apAvfti#}.] E. unknown. See {#pa#} and the Preface.
