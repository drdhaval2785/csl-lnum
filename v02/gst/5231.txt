{#apuruzArTa#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rTaH#}) <sup>1</sup> (In the Mīmānsā philosophy.)
<div n="lb">A religious act which is not performed on account of the
<div n="lb">gratification of the sacrificer, but because it is essential to
<div n="lb">the sacrifice itself; see {#kratvarTa#}. <sup>2</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya philos.)
<div n="lb">Not the chief object of the Soul; occurring in the Sūtras
<div n="lb">in its abstract deriv. {#apuruzArTatva;#} e. g. {#apuruzArTatvamuBayaTA#}
<div n="lb">‘in neither way is (nihilism) the chief end of the Soul’; or
<div n="lb">{#nAnuSrAvikAdapi tatsidDiH sADyatvenAvfttiyogAdapuruzArTatvam#}
<div n="lb">‘the accomplishment thereof (i. e. of liberation) does not
<div n="lb">arise, moreover, from scriptural means, for since trans-
<div n="lb">migration is connected with the result (of religious acts,
<div n="lb">the performance of such acts) is not the chief object of the
<div n="lb">Soul’; or {#suKalABABAvAdapuruzArTatvamiti cenna dvEviDyAt#} ‘if
<div n="lb">you reason that, since there is no such a thing as obtain-
<div n="lb">ing happiness, (final liberation as the absence of pain) is not
<div n="lb">the chief object of the Soul, you are wrong, for its object
<div n="lb">is twofold (viz. obtaining happiness and not having pain)’.
