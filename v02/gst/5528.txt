{#apramAdam#}¦ Tatpur. ind. Attentively, watchfully, assiduously;
<div n="lb">e. g. {%Vājas.:%} {#sapta fzayaH pratihitAH SarIre sapta rakzanti sada-#}
<div n="lb">{#mapramAdam#}. [The meaning of this word would apparently
<div n="lb">also result from the Bahuvr. {#apramAda#} taken as a neuter in
<div n="lb">the accus., but as the latter is udātta on the last syllable,
<div n="lb">and as {#apramAdam#} is in the Vedas udātta on the first, it
<div n="lb">seems necessary to distinguish both forms etymologically.]
<div n="lb">E. {#a#} neg. and {#pramAdam#} ({#mad#} with {#pra,#} kṛt aff. {#Ramul#}).
