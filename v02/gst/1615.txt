{#adas#}Â¦ I. m. f. n. ({#asO-asO-adas#}). The pronoun (see {#sarva-#}
<div n="lb">{#nAman#}) which generally points to what is absent, remote
<div n="lb">or uncertain (differently from {#idam#} q. v.) and which cor-
<div n="lb">responds with <sup>1</sup> That. <sup>2</sup> A certain (so and so). In correlative
<div n="lb">phrases it stands therefore usually in the prior sentence,
<div n="lb">imparting greater emphasis. Its declension is defective in
<div n="lb">as far as most of its cases are supplied by the themes {#asu#}
<div n="lb">or {#asa, amu (amU)#} and {#ami (amI)#}. The theme which ap-
[Page047-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">pears in composition is {#adas#} (except in the forms {#ada-#}
<div n="lb">{#dryaYc#} &c. q. v. See also {#adDA#}). In some derivations of rare
<div n="lb">occurrence we meet also with the themes {#asu, asa#} and {#amu;#}
<div n="lb">see {#asuka, asaka, amuka#}.
<div n="P">II. ind. (esp. in composition with radicals (see {#gati#}),
<div n="lb">when employed reflectively). So, in such a manner, f. i.
<div n="lb">{#adaHkftya#} having done so &c.--In conjunction with a re-
<div n="lb">lative pronoun or particle it has the effect of giving em-
<div n="lb">phasis or of generalising, e. g. {#yadadas#} whatever, {#yatrAdas#}
<div n="lb">wherever, {#yaTAdas#} howsoever. E. unknown; but it is pro-
<div n="lb">bably derived from the theme {#ad#} which occurs in {#ada-#}
<div n="lb">{#dryaYc#} and {#adDA#}.
