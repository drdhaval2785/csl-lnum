{#apavarta#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rtaH#}) (In Algebra.) The common measure,
<div n="lb">the divisor which is assumed for both or either of the quan-
<div n="lb">tities, without leaving a remainder ({%Colebr. Brahmagupta%}
<div n="lb">p. 363); e. g. {#utpatsyamAnayEvaM mUlakaraRyAlpayA caturguRayA .#}
<div n="lb">{#yAsAmapavartaH syAdrUpakftestA viSoDyAH syuH . apavartAdapi#}
<div n="lb">{#labDA mUlakaraRyo Bavanti tAScApi .#} ‘those terms are to be
<div n="lb">subtracted from the square of the rational number, which
<div n="lb">are exactly measured by four times the smaller radical surd
<div n="lb">thence to be deduced; the quotients found by that common
<div n="lb">measure are surds in the root’. (In this passage from the
<div n="lb">{%Vījagaṇita%} p. 18 Colebrooke (Alg. p. 153) has had however
<div n="lb">instead of the first {#apavarta,#} the reading {#apavartana#} q. v.) E.
