{#aprayAvam#}¦ Tatpur. ind. (ved.) Assiduously, attentively; ({%Mahīdh.%}
<div n="lb">= {#apramattam#}). E. According to this comm. the word would
<div n="lb">be the acc. neuter of a Bahuvr. {#a#} priv. and {#prayAva,#} but as
<div n="lb">it is udātta on the first syllable it seems more correct to
<div n="lb">derive it from {#a#} neg. and {#prayAvam#} ({#yu#} with {#pra,#} kṛt aff.
<div n="lb">{#Ramul#}).
