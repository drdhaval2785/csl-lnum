{#anA#}Â¦ ind. (ved.) Certainly, indeed. (A commentator of the
<div n="lb">Amarakosha considers this particle as a synonyme of the
<div n="lb">negative {#na;#} his opinion rests, however, only on an arti-
<div n="lb">ficial interpretation of the word {#anAvfzwi#} (q. v.) and is
<div n="lb">refuted by others who explain it as derived, not from {#anA#}
<div n="lb">and {#vfzwi,#} but from {#a#} neg. and {#Avfzwi#}.) E. unknown;
<div n="lb">probably an obsolete third case of the pronominal theme
<div n="lb">{#a#} (q. v.).
