{#anyonyahastakalita#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Held reci-
<div n="lb">procally in (his several) hands. This word occurs in an
<div n="lb">example of permutation, given in the Līlavatī, where the
[Page150-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">question is put, ‘how many are the variations of form of
<div n="lb">the god Śiva by the exchange of his ten attributes held reci-
<div n="lb">procally in his hands viz. the rope, the elephant's hook &c.,
<div n="lb">as those of Viṣṇu by the exchange of the mace &c.?’ (the
<div n="lb">practical purpose apparently being to know the number of
<div n="lb">variations that may be effected in the representation of the
<div n="lb">idol): {#pASANkuSAhiqamarUkakapAlaSUlEH . KawvANgaSaktiSaracA-#}
<div n="lb">{#payutErBavanti . anyonyahastakalitEH kati mUrtiBedAH SamBorhareriva#}
<div n="lb">{#gadArisarojaSaNKEH#} (The answer is in the case of Śiva:
<div n="lb">3628800; in that of Viṣṇu: 24; and Colebrooke adds (Alg.
<div n="lb">p. 124 note): ‘the 24 different representations of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb">arising from his diversity in the manner of placing the
<div n="lb">weapons or attributes in his four hands, are distinguished
<div n="lb">by as many discriminative titles of the god allotted to those
<div n="lb">figures in the theogonies of the Purāṇas. It does not ap-
<div n="lb">pear that distinct titles have been in like manner assigned
<div n="lb">to any part of the more than three millions of varied re-
<div n="lb">presentations of Śiva’.) E. {#anyonya-hasta#} and {#kalita#}.
