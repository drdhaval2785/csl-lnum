<div n="lb">tion of the earth by water. ‘A hundred thousand years pre-
<div n="lb">vious to the destruction of the earth by water, a Deva ap-
<div n="lb">pears to warn all the beings concerned of the event, as when
<div n="lb">it is destroyed by fire; a cloud forms at the same time in a
<div n="lb">Kela-laksha of Sakwalas and after raining for a short time
<div n="lb">disappears. After an immense interval another cloud appears,
<div n="lb">and the rain called Khārodaka begins to fall; at first in
<div n="lb">small drops, but gradually increasing in size until they are
<div n="lb">as large as a palm tree; this rain is so acrid that it dissolves
<div n="lb">entirely the earth and all things connected with it’ (Spence
<div n="lb">Hardy, Manual of Buddhism p. 32). E. {#apas#} and {#saMvarta#}.
