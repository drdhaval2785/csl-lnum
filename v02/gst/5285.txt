<div n="lb">Thinking founded on the category of relation; this term
<div n="lb">designates more especially:
<div n="P">{%A.%} When applied to the notion of {%quantity%} in general,
[Page202-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">that {%mental process in which originates the notion of multipli-%}
<div n="lb">{%city;%} it is conceived and defined in the following manner:
<div n="lb">‘the eye having come into contact with two substances,
<div n="lb">there arises a notion of what is general to the two notions
<div n="lb">of ‘unity’ inherent in either substance, viz. the class of
<div n="lb">the notions of unity or the {%class of monads;%} these two sub-
<div n="lb">stances or unities having become determined, there arises
<div n="lb">a thinking of the quality ‘unity’ previously determined by
<div n="lb">the general notion (monad) [for the special unity could not
<div n="lb">be conceived without a previous knowledge of the general
<div n="lb">notion to which it belongs; comp. also the instance in the
<div n="lb">comm. to the {%Bhāṣāparichchheda%} v. 57]; this thinking is
<div n="lb">the {#apekzAbudDi;#} through it is produced a duality consisting
<div n="lb">of these two substances (unities); it leads to the generality
<div n="lb">or {%class of dyads;%} this class of dyads is reflected upon,
<div n="lb">and through such reflection the {#apekzAbudDi#} ceases; again
<div n="lb">that special thinking whose object is the quality ‘duality’,
<div n="lb">determined by the general notion (dyad), having produced
<div n="lb">the duality of the two substances (unities), the quality
<div n="lb">‘duality’ ceases after the {#apekzAbudDi#} (i. e. that thinking
<div n="lb">itself) has ceased. [{%Śaṅkara%} in the {%Upaskāra%} on {%Kaṇāda%}

<div n="lb">versa ({%Kaṇāda:%} {#sAmAnyajYAnAdapekzAbudDinASaH#}). From the
<div n="lb">moment when the eye comes into contact with the objects
<div n="lb">till the moment when the {#apekzAbudDi#} ceases there are eight
<div n="lb">phases, viz. 1. contact &c., 2. comprehension of the class
<div n="lb">of monads, based on the quality ‘unity’, 3. {#apekzAbudDi#} or

<div n="lb">prehension of the quality ‘duality’ determined by its class,
