{#aByArohaRIya#}¦ m. ({#-yaH#}) The name of a Soma sacrifice:
<div n="lb">the first of the seven Soma sacrifices of the {%Rājasūya%}
<div n="lb">which is performed by a king (see {#rAjasUya#} and the quo-
<div n="lb">tations s. v. {#aBizecanIya#}); it is called so in the {%Śrauta%}
<div n="lb">{%Sūtras%} of {%Āśvalāyana%} and of the {%Sāmaveda-schools,%} but for
<div n="lb">shortness sake {#pavitra#} in the {%Śrauta S.%} of {%Kātyāyana;%} ({%Āśval.:%}

<div n="lb">{#tantramaBiDIyate#}).--The {%Abhyārohanīya%} (or {%Pavitra%}) com-
<div n="lb">mences on the first day of the first or light fortnight of the
<div n="lb">month Phālguna (February-March) and lasts eight days, the
<div n="lb">{%four%} first of which are occupied by the {%Dīkṣā%} or initiatory
<div n="lb">rites, the {%three%} following by the {%Upasad%}-offerings (q. v.)
<div n="lb">and the {%eighth%} by the {%Sutyā%} (q. v.; {%Yājnik. Paddh.:%} {#caturdI-#}
<div n="lb">{#kzastryupasatka ekasutyaH pavitrasaMjYakaH somayAgo'gnizwomasaMsTaH#});
<div n="lb">the presents given to the priests are a thousand cows; in the
<div n="lb">choice of the priests, the buying of the Soma &c. it con-
<div n="lb">forms itself, as is said before, to the rules of the Agni-
<div n="lb">ṣṭoma.--The rites connected with this sacrifice and
<div n="lb">following it, are: on the {%ninth%} day the {%Pūrṇāhuti%} or a liba-
<div n="lb">tion of a ladle-full of butter, in the house of the sacrificer,
<div n="lb">if he wishes it;--the present he makes on this occasion,
<div n="lb">being left to his own liberality. ({%Harisvāmin%} adds the
<div n="lb">following details, which may serve as an instance: the
<div n="lb">Adhwaryu takes first the Āhavanīya fire out; four seats
<div n="lb">are prepared; the choice of the Brahman is made silently;
[Page316-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">the Adhw. sits silently down at the right side of the Brahman
<div n="lb">and the sacrificer, prepares the clarified butter, cleans the
<div n="lb">ladles {%Sruch%} and {%Sruva%} and takes with the {%Sruva%} as much
<div n="lb">butter as is necessary to fill the {%Sruch;%} then he proceeds
<div n="lb">with fuel and the {%Sruch%} to the fire, sits down, puts the
<div n="lb">fuel on and in saying svāhā! sacrifices the butter with the
<div n="lb">words: ‘this to Agni, this to Prajāpati’; then the sacri-
<div n="lb">ficer gives the present to the Adhwaryu.) The principal
<div n="lb">ceremonies after this libation are: on the following or {%tenth%}
<div n="lb">day the burnt sacrifice of a Puroḍāśa fried in eight bowls,
<div n="lb">under the recital of {%Vājas.%} 9. 35., to Anumati (q. v.), when
<div n="lb">the present to the priest is a garment; on the {%eleventh%} day
<div n="lb">the sacrifice of a Puroḍāśa fried in eleven bowls, to Agni
<div n="lb">and Viṣṇu, the present being gold; on the {%twelfth%} day, of
<div n="lb">a Puroḍāśa, also fried in eleven bowls, to Agni and Soma,
<div n="lb">the present: a cow which has been several times liberated,
<div n="lb">(liberation being the object to be effectuated by this gift);
<div n="lb">on the {%thirteenth%} day, of a Puroḍāśa fried in twelve bowls,
<div n="lb">when the priest receives a bull; on the {%fourteenth%} day, an
<div n="lb">{%Āgrayaṇeṣṭi%} (q. v.) accompanied with the gift of a cow.--
<div n="lb">The next four sacrifices are those which constitute the
<div n="lb">{%Chāturmāsya%} ceremonies, viz. the {%Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapra-%}
<div n="lb">{%ghāsa, Sākamedha%} and {%Śunasīrya%} (qq. vv.); they are per-
<div n="lb">formed during four successive months but so that the com-
<div n="lb">mencement of the {%Śunasīrya%} falls on the same day on which
<div n="lb">the Dīkṣā of the Abhyārohanīya had begun in the pre-
<div n="lb">ceding year. The rite on the {%first%} day of the Śunasīrya is
<div n="lb">the {%Pañchavatīya%} (q. v.), viz. a libation of butter under
<div n="lb">special injunctions and accompanied by the muttering of
<div n="lb">the verses {%Vāj.%} 9. 35. and 37., (performed esp. when the king
<div n="lb">suffers from a painful disease, since it will give him relief);
<div n="lb">the present is a cart with three horses. There follows on the
<div n="lb">{%second%} day the {%Indraturīya%} which consists of four libations,
<div n="lb">viz. a libation of {%Havis%} fried in eight bowls, to Agni,--
<div n="lb">of {%Charu%} made of barley, to Varuṇa,--of Charu made
<div n="lb">of gavedhuka-rice, to Rudra,--of curds proceeding from
<div n="lb">the milk of a cart-cow, to Indra; and this cow is then
<div n="lb">offered to the priest as a present. The sacrifice on the
<div n="lb">then following, or {%third,%} day is the {%Apāmārgahoma,%} which
<div n="lb">serves also to break the spell of incantatory rites performed
<div n="lb">by an enemy and to turn them against himself, and the
<div n="lb">peculiarities of which are therefore described with some
<div n="lb">detail by {%Kāty.%} and the commentator; it seems to be barren
<div n="lb">for the Adhwaryu, for no present is mentioned. The next
<div n="lb">in order are the {%Trishamyukta%}-libations in three divisions:
<div n="lb">first, Puroḍāśa fried in eleven bowls, to Agni and Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb">Charu to Indra and Viṣṇu, and Charu or Puroḍāśa fried
<div n="lb">in three bowls to Viṣṇu;--the present is a short bull or
<div n="lb">cow; secondly on the following day, Puroḍāśa fried in
<div n="lb">eleven bowls, to Agni and Pūṣan, Charu to Indra and
<div n="lb">Pūṣan, and Charu to Pūṣan, the present: a black bull
<div n="lb">or cow; thirdly on the following day, Puroḍāśa fried in
<div n="lb">eleven bowls, to Agni and Soma, Charu to Indra and
<div n="lb">Soma, and Charu to Soma, the present: a tawny bull or
<div n="lb">cow; on the next day Puroḍāśa fried in twelve bowls is
<div n="lb">offered to Viśvānara, and Charu made of barley to Va-
[Page316-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">ruṇa, or the latter libation is spared for a separate, the
<div n="lb">following day; in such a case the present given to the
<div n="lb">priest for the libation to Viśvānara is a bull, and for that
<div n="lb">to Varuṇa, a black garment, or if such a garment cannot
<div n="lb">be had, one that is not black. [The Śunasīrya and the
<div n="lb">other ceremonies would therefore comprise seven, or if the
<div n="lb">two last are performed on one day, six days; and the cere-
<div n="lb">mony to be mentioned presently, the {%Ratnahavis,%} would be-
<div n="lb">gin on the eighth or seventh day after the Śunasīrya. Such
<div n="lb">is the rule of the {%Kāṇva%} school, but {%Harisvāmin%} despatches
<div n="lb">the {%Indraturīya, Apāmārgahoma%} and the three {%Trishamyukta%}
<div n="lb">on the day after the Śunasīrya, and puts the Viśvānara-
<div n="lb">and Varuṇa-libations on the third, or the Viśvānara-lib.
<div n="lb">on the third and the Varuṇa-lib. on the fourth day, with
<div n="lb">the further remark that, according to the option in the per-
<div n="lb">forming of the latter rites, the beginning of the next fol-
<div n="lb">lowing, the {%Ratnahavis,%} would come to fall either on the
<div n="lb">third or on the fourth day. This difference between the
<div n="lb">two schools, as regards the time of the performance of these
<div n="lb">rites, continues therefore in what follows.] The rites next
<div n="lb">in order are twelve libations called {%Ratnahavis%} (q. v.) which
<div n="lb">are performed on twelve successive days in twelve different
<div n="lb">houses, whereto the sacrificer repairs for this purpose on
<div n="lb">each following day, with the {%Gārhapatya%} and {%Āhavanīya%}
<div n="lb">fire placed on the two {%Araṇis;%} viz. a libation of 1. Puroḍāśa
<div n="lb">fried in eight bowls, to Agni Anīkavat, in the house of
<div n="lb">the {%Senānī%} or commander in chief; 2. Charu to Bṛhaspati,
<div n="lb">in the house of the {%Purohita%} or family priest; 3. Puroḍāśa
<div n="lb">fried in eleven bowls to Indra, in the house of the {%Yaja-%}
<div n="lb">{%māna%} or the king for whom all these proceedings take
<div n="lb">place; 4. Charu to Aditi, in the h. of the {%Mahiṣī%} or his
<div n="lb">first and principal wife; 5. Charu (made of barley) to Va-
<div n="lb">ruṇa in the h. of the {%Sūta%} or the master of the horse
<div n="lb">({%Yājnik.:%} = {#aSvasAraTiH;#} {%Hariśv.:%} = {#aSvapozaka#}); 6. Puro-
<div n="lb">ḍāśa fried in eight bowls, to the Maruts, in the h. of the
<div n="lb">{%Grāmaṇī%} or mayor ({%Yājnik.:%} = {#grAmanetA vESyAnAM mahattaraH#});
<div n="lb">7. Puroḍāśa fried in twelve or eight bowls, to Savitṛ, in
<div n="lb">the h. of the {%Kṣattṛ%} or goldstick-in-waiting (at the same
<div n="lb">time the overseer of the harem and confidential messenger;
<div n="lb">({%Sāy.:%} {#kzattA nAma yazwihasto'ntaHpurADyakzaH sarvezAM niyantA#}
<div n="lb">{#pratihArAparaparyAyaH#}); 8. Puroḍāśa fried in two bowls, to
<div n="lb">the Aśvins, in the h. of the {%Saṅgrahītṛ%} or the driver (who
<div n="lb">stands on the left side of the king in his carriage); 9. Charu
<div n="lb">to {%Pūṣan,%} in the h. of the {%Bhāgadugha%} or minister of the
<div n="lb">revenue ({%Sāy.:%} {#rAjYaH prAptaM zazWaM BAgaM prajAByo gfhItvA rAjYe#}
<div n="lb">{#dogDi prayacCatIti BAgaduGaH#}); 10. Charu made of Gave-
<div n="lb">dhukas which have been fetched from the houses of the
<div n="lb">overseer of the gambling halls ({%akṣavāpa%}) and of the {%govi-%}
<div n="lb">{%kartṛ%} or (master of the) huntsmen (or acc. to others of a
<div n="lb">ploughman), to Rudra, in the h. of the {%Yajamāna%} or sacri-
<div n="lb">ficer; 11. Ājya or clarified butter taken four times, to Road
<div n="lb">(personified as a divinity), in addressing it with the words
<div n="lb">‘may Road liking the clarified butter partake of it ({%Śatap.%}
<div n="lb">V. 3. 1. 11.)’, in the h. of the {%Dūta%} or messenger; 12. a
<div n="lb">Darvihoma of Charu made of black rice which has been
<div n="lb">unhusked with the finger-nails, under the recital of the
[Page317-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">words {#eza--svAhA#} ({%Vājas.%} 9. 35.), or a simple Charu pre-
<div n="lb">pared in the same manner under the recital of the same
<div n="lb">words and a {%Vaṣaṭkāra,%} to Nirṛti, in the h. of a wife of
<div n="lb">the king who has been left by him for want of having
<div n="lb">borne him a son. The presents to the priests in the pre-
<div n="lb">ceding twelve acts are severally (and in the given order):
<div n="lb">1. gold, 2. a cow with a black back (or acc. to others with
<div n="lb">a white back; see {#SitipfzWa#}), 3. a bull, 4. a milch-cow, 5. a
<div n="lb">horse, 6. a spotted cow, 7. a red (or acc. to others, a white;
<div n="lb">see {#Syeta#}) cart-ox, 8. two twin-cows or, if they cannot be
<div n="lb">had, two cows, which are born one after the other, 9. a
<div n="lb">cow with white and black hairs, 10. three presents (for the
<div n="lb">lib. to Rudra), viz. a. either a cow with white thighs (acc.
<div n="lb">to some, with black thighs) or one with a white tail (acc.
<div n="lb">to some, with a black tail; see {#SitibAhu#} and {#Siti-#}
<div n="lb">{#vAla#}), b. a dagger-sword, sharp and its point unbent,
<div n="lb">(without a sheath), c. a vessel where gambling-dice are
<div n="lb">thrown in, tied round with a cord made of hairs; 11. three
<div n="lb">presents (for the lib. to Road), viz. a. a bow covered with
<div n="lb">{%pyukṣṇas%} [which word is rendered by {%Sāy.:%} tendon, by
<div n="lb">{%Yājnik.%} in reference to others: tail of a peacock, or skin
<div n="lb">of a boa constrictor; the E. I. H. Ms. of the comm. to
<div n="lb">{%Śatap.%} V. 3. 1. 11. and {%Weber'%}s ed. read {#ukzRa°#} for {#pyukzRa#}
<div n="lb">which seems doubtful, though {#ukzRa#} is explained {#ukzavikAra#}],
<div n="lb">b. a leather quiver with arrows, and c. a red turban; 12. a
<div n="lb">black, old diseased cow.--Then the king tells his bar-
<div n="lb">ren wife to go forth and out of his power, and she re-
<div n="lb">pairs to the house of a Brāhmaṇa where the king has no
<div n="lb">more any control over her.--After the {%Ratnahavis%} have
<div n="lb">been completed, the (royal) sacrificer goes to his palace
<div n="lb">and makes (apparently on the day of the twelfth Ratna-
<div n="lb">havis) a libation of Charu which has been prepared in the
<div n="lb">milk of a white cow which has had a white calf, to Soma
<div n="lb">and Rudra; and the present he makes to the priest, is this
<div n="lb">white cow; (this rite is performed esp. if the king suffers
<div n="lb">from scabs or vitiligo). On the following day he makes a
<div n="lb">libation of Charu to Mitra and Bṛhaspati, and makes to
<div n="lb">the priest the gift of a cow. This libation which is also
<div n="lb">the subject of special injunctions, closes the rites which are
<div n="lb">connected with the Abhyārohaṇīya and are immediately
<div n="lb">followed by those of the {%Abhiṣechanīya.%} [The {%Sāmaveda%}
<div n="lb">school must have rejected the performance of the Śunāsīrya
<div n="lb">and of all the following rites, since they place with distinct
<div n="lb">words the beginning of the {%Abhiṣechanīya (v. s. v.)%} on the
<div n="lb">same day of the following year on which, in the previous
<div n="lb">year, the initiatory rite of the Abhyār. commenced, viz. on
<div n="lb">the first day of the light fortnight of the month Phālguna,
<div n="lb">i. e. on the same day when acc. to the {%Yajurveda%} school,
<div n="lb">the Śunāsīrya would have to begin (e. g. {%Lātyāy. Śr. S.:%}

<div n="lb">who seems to assign only a fortnight to the performance
<div n="lb">of the rites from the Śunāsīrya to the last Charu-libation,
