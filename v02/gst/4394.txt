<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> (ved.) Going along or lengthwise; as opposed to {#udac#} and
<div n="lb">{#tiryac#} qq. vv.--The neuter {#anvak#} is used as adv. and as-
<div n="lb">sumes in conjunction with {#BUtvA#} or in composition with {#BUya#}
<div n="lb">and {#BAvam#} (see {#anvagBAvam#}) the meaning of ‘friendly or
<div n="lb">favourably disposed’. [Pāṇini, in the rule III. 4. 64. makes
<div n="lb">uses of the form {#anvaci#} which has the value there of a
<div n="lb">locat. of {#anvac;#} Patanjali blames him for this liberty: {#a-#}
<div n="lb">{#yukto'yaM nirdeSaH . anUcIti Bavitavyam . sOtro'yaM nirdeSaH .#}.
<div n="lb">But as Pāṇini expresses himself in a similar manner when
<div n="lb">speaking of {#tiryac#} III. 4. 60. {#‘tiryacyapavarge’#}--when he in-
<div n="lb">curs a like remark from Patanjali--, it is perhaps more
<div n="lb">just to say that he did not intend to speak in these rules
<div n="lb">of the declinable {#anvac#} and {#tiryac,#} but of their neuters
<div n="lb">become indeclinable; and that, his method requiring in these
<div n="lb">rules the locative of the mentioned words, {#anvaci#} and {#ti-#}
<div n="lb">{#ryaci#} were less objectionable than {#anvaki#} and {#tiryaki,#} while
<div n="lb">{#anUci#} and {#tiraSci,#} as suggested by Patanjali, would not
<div n="lb">have necessarily conveyed the notion of indeclinable words.]
