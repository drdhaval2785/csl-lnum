{#anfta#}¦ Tatpur. I. 1. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Untrue.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-tam#}) Untruth, falsehood. (In the mythology
<div n="lb">of the Purāṇas Anṛta is the son of Adharma (vice) and
<div n="lb">Hinsā (violence), and the brother of Nikṛti (immorality);
<div n="lb">they intermarry and have two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Na-
<div n="lb">raka (hell) and twins to them, two daughters, Māyā (de-
<div n="lb">ceit) and Vedanā (torture) who became their wives.--In the
<div n="lb">Rāmāyaṇa Anṛta is the name of one of the mystical weapons
<div n="lb">delivered to Rāma by Viśvāmitra.) E. {#a#} neg. and {#fta#}.
<div n="P">II. n. ({#-tam#}) Agriculture. E. According to the native comm.
<div n="lb">the etym. would be the same as before; their account for the
<div n="lb">meaning ‘agriculture’ however is not very plausible, some
<div n="lb">explain it: ‘because agriculture is like falsehood’ or ‘because
<div n="lb">agriculture cannot be carried on without falsehood’, another
<div n="lb">refers {#fta#} in this sense to the radical {#f#} ‘to hurt’ and ex-
<div n="lb">plains it as a Bahuvr. ‘that from which injury does not
<div n="lb">arise’. The etym. of this meaning and its probable con-
<div n="lb">nection with {#pramfta#} used in the same sense by Manu will be
<div n="lb">discussed in the Preface.
