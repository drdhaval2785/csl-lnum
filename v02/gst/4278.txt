{#anyapUrvA#}¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-vA#}) A woman who has been given to,
<div n="lb">or has had intercourse with, another man than the one to
<div n="lb">whom she is married; this may be the case if she is either
<div n="lb">a {#punarBU#} or a {#svEriRI;#} as a {#punarBU#} (q. v.) again, she had either
<div n="lb">ceased to be a virgin before the nuptial ceremonies, or she
<div n="lb">had remained a virgin and become blemished through the
<div n="lb">repeated celebration of the marriage ceremonies; she is
<div n="lb">{#svEriRI#} or licentious, if she leaves her husband and goes,
<div n="lb">out of lust, to a man of the same caste. A woman, how-
<div n="lb">ever, is not considered to be a {#punarBU,#} if she is left without
<div n="lb">a son and, by order of her Guru, is approached, for the
<div n="lb">sake of getting a son, by her brother-in-law, or a relative
<div n="lb">of the class of the Sapiṇḍas or a man of the same Gotra,
<div n="lb">either of them having been previously anointed with clari-
<div n="lb">fied butter. (According to the Mitākṣara as founded on
<div n="lb">Yājnavalkya; Manu applies the term {#parapUrvA,#} the same as
<div n="lb">{#anyapUrvA,#} only to the licentious woman who leaves her hus-
<div n="lb">band for another man; Nārada uses the synonymous term
<div n="lb">{#parapUrvA#} in a similar manner as the Mitākṣara {#anyapUrvA,#} but
<div n="lb">divides the {#punarBU#} into three and the {#svEriRI#} into four cate-
<div n="lb">gories; for according to him a {#punarBU#} may be either a virgin-
<div n="lb">woman who is blemished by having gone through the mar-
<div n="lb">riage ceremonies for a second time, or a woman who first
<div n="lb">has been given to one and then on account of her love, to
<div n="lb">another, or a woman who, in want of a brother-in-law,
<div n="lb">is given by her relations to a Sapiṇḍa-relative of the same
<div n="lb">caste; a {#svEriRI#} a woman, whether having had children or
[Page145-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">not, who, while her husband is alive, goes to another from
<div n="lb">lust, or a woman who leaves her infant husband for another
<div n="lb">man and later returns to the house of her husband; or a
<div n="lb">woman who after the death of her husband slights her brother-
<div n="lb">in-law and the other relations (she may approach) and goes
<div n="lb">from lust to another man, or lastly, a woman who has come
<div n="lb">from the country and, purchased with money, under the
<div n="lb">pressure of hunger and thirst gives herself up to another
<div n="lb">man. E. {#anya#} and {#pUrva;#} scil. {#strI#}.
