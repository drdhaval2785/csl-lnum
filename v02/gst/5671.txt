{#apsukzit#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-t#}) (ved.) Residing in the intermediate
<div n="lb">region, in the region between heaven and earth, viz. the
<div n="lb">eleven gods which form one class, besides the class of eleven
<div n="lb">gods which reside in heaven, and another class of eleven
<div n="lb">gods which reside over the earth. (An interpretation ‘re-
<div n="lb">siding in the waters’ has been applied to these gods pro-
<div n="lb">bably in order to suggest what Hindu mythology {%ought%} to
<div n="lb">have been, but it is neither countenanced by Sāyaṇa nor
<div n="lb">by Mahīdh. nor by any other authority.) E. {#apsu#} (loc. of
