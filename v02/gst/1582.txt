{#adakziRa#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-RaH-RA-Ram#}) I. Tatpur. <sup>1</sup> Not right, left.
<div n="lb"><sup>2</sup> Not clever, unskilful. E. {#a#} neg. and {#dakziRa#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. Being or being performed without the presents
<div n="lb">usually given to Brahmans (see {#dakziRA#}), as a sacrifice &c.
<div n="lb">The celebration of a sacrifice without the Dakṣiṇā oc-
<div n="lb">curs for instance under the following circumstances: at
<div n="lb">the Prātaḥsavana of the Jyotiṣṭoma, when about to sing
<div n="lb">the Vahiṣpavamāna stotra, the priests step out from the
<div n="lb">house where the sacred fire is kept, one going after the
<div n="lb">other and holding the one who precedes by the hem of his
<div n="lb">garment: if it so happens, at this procession, that the
<div n="lb">Udgātṛ inadvertently drops the hem, the sacrifice goes on
<div n="lb">without the Dakṣiṇā; once accomplished, however, it is
<div n="lb">to be repeated and then the Udgātṛ has to pay the Dakṣiṇā
<div n="lb">which should have been given at the first performance; if
<div n="lb">the Pratihartṛ meets with a similar accident, he has to pay
<div n="lb">his whole property at the renewal of the ceremony, which
<div n="lb">then is called {#sarvasvadakziRa#}. E. {#a#} priv. and {#dakziRA#}.
