{#annAyu#}¦ m. ({#-yuH#}) I. Tatpur. Seizing food (see {#anna#} 2. 2.); or
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. Living through food (see {#anna#} 2. 2.); an epithet
<div n="lb">of the vital air {#apAna#} q. v., in the Aitareya Upanishad,
<div n="lb">because it alone was capable to seize the primitive food,
<div n="lb">created from the waters by the Supreme Soul, after speech,
<div n="lb">the vital air {#prARa#} q. v., eye, ear, skin (i. e. touch), manas and
<div n="lb">the generative organ were unable to take possession of, and
<div n="lb">thus of preserving, life through it. In the passage alluded
<div n="lb">to there is a quibble on the word {#Ayu,#} according to its
<div n="lb">having the sense of ‘obtaining’ from the corresponding
<div n="lb">meaning of the rad. {#I, vI,#} or the sense of {#Ayus#} ‘life’;
<div n="lb">as the word occurs in the nomin. {#annAyuH,#} it may, as a
<div n="lb">Bahuvr., represent also the form {#annAyus#}. The radical {#I#}
<div n="lb">having the same meaning as {#vI#} and probably being identical
<div n="lb">with it in origin, the words {#vayat#} and {#vAyu#} ‘air or taking’,
<div n="lb">in the same passage, complete the double sense of the pun:
<div n="lb">‘{#tad#} (i. e. {#annaM#}) {#apAnenAjiGfkzattadA vayat . sa ezo'nnasya#}
<div n="lb">{#graho#} (comm. = {#annagrAhakaH#}) {#yadvAyurannAyurvA eza yadvAyuH;#}
<div n="lb">comm.: {#yo vAyurannAyurannabanDano'nnajIvano vE prasidDaM sa eza#}
<div n="lb">{#yo vAyuH#}. E. {#anna#} and {#Ayu#}.
