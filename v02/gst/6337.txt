{#aBivAdana#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) Respectful salutation of a superior
<div n="lb">or elder, especially of a Guru, by a junior or inferior for the
<div n="lb">sake of obtaining his blessing; ({%Vīramitr. Āchāraprak.:%} {#a-#}
<div n="lb">{#BivAdananAma vaworAtmAnamaBi gurorASIrvacanAnukUlo vyApA-#}
<div n="lb">{#raH#}). It consists of three acts, viz. 1. the {#pratyutTAna#} or rising
<div n="lb">from the seat, 2. the {#upasaMgrahaRa#} or {#pAdopasaMgrahaRa,#} the peculiar
[Page264-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">mode of Hindu obeisance, and 3. the {#aBivAda#} or the ut-
<div n="lb">tering of the formula of salutation.
<div n="P"><sup>a.</sup> The first act is indispensable on the part of the person
<div n="lb">whose duty it is to make the salutation, whatever be the
<div n="lb">quality of the person saluted ({%Āpastamba:%} {#sarvatra tu pratyutTA-#}
<div n="lb">{#yABivAdanam#}); but the two other acts undergo various
<div n="lb">modifications according to the rank or quality of the person
<div n="lb">saluted and the person saluting.
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> With regard to the {#upasaMgrahaRa#} or the obeisance, the
<div n="lb">general rule is, according to {%Manu,%} that the saluter should
<div n="lb">with crossed hands ({%comm.:%} the right hand being placed
<div n="lb">over the left) clasp the feet of his {%Guru,%} touching the left
<div n="lb">foot with his left, and the right foot with his right, hand;
<div n="lb">({%Manu:%} {#vyastapARinA kAryamupasaMgrahaRaM guroH . savyena savyaH#}
<div n="lb">{#sprazwavyo dakziRena ca dakziRaH#}); the same injunction is given
<div n="lb">by {%Āśvalāyana%} and {%Baudhāyana%} with the addition that he
<div n="lb">should first touch, with composure of mind, his own left
<div n="lb">ear with his left and his right ear with his right, hand,
<div n="lb">and then make his bow, in the indicated manner, by
<div n="lb">touching his Guru from the knees to the feet; ({%Āśvalāy.:%}

<div n="lb">hollow, when he touches the feet of the Guru and he
<div n="lb">is forbidden, under the threat of loosing the benefit of all
<div n="lb">his pious actions, to perform this act only with one hand

<div n="lb">when saluting should raise his right arm as far as his ears,
<div n="lb">a Kshatriya as far as his breast (or according to a v. 1. as
<div n="lb">far as his shoulder), a Vaiśya as far as his navel and that
<div n="lb">a Sūdra making his obeisance should hold it down ({%Āpast.:%}

<div n="lb">latter: {#aMsasamaM rAjanya ityapi pAWaH . maDyaM nABiH;#} {%Atri,%} how-
<div n="lb">ever, seems to reserve this mode of salutation for a learned
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa in general, while he enjoins the touching of the
<div n="lb">feet, if the person saluted is a Guru; {#dakziRaM pARimudDftya#}
<div n="lb">{#prakAmamaBivAdayet . Srotriye tvaYjaliH kAryaH pAdopagrahaRaM gu-#}
<div n="lb">{#roriti#}). If the person to be saluted is a woman, the
<div n="lb">politeness of touching her from the knees to the feet is sub-
<div n="lb">ject to some restrictions: if she is the wife of the {%Guru,%}
<div n="lb">but not of the same class as her husband, {%Manu%} and other
<div n="lb">legislators dispense with it altogether; if she is of the same
<div n="lb">class and the student is young, he must pay her that re-
<div n="lb">spect only when he returns from a journey, on other oc-
<div n="lb">casions he prostrates himself before her at his daily salu-
<div n="lb">tation, ({%Vīram.%} on {%Manu%} 2. 217. and {%Gautama:%} {#viprozyeti va-#}
<div n="lb">{#canAnna pratyahamiti gamyate#}); but if she is young and the young
<div n="lb">man knows already to distinguish right from wrong which
[Page265-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">is the case when he has completed his twentieth year (ac-
<div n="lb">cording to {%Manu;%} or his sixteenth year, according to the
<div n="lb">{%Vīram.%} on {%Gautama%}) he must never touch her feet but al-
<div n="lb">ways prostrate himself before her; {%Manu%} enjoins further
<div n="lb">that the sister of his mother, the wife of his maternal
<div n="lb">uncle, his own wife's mother and the sister of his father
<div n="lb">must be treated by him like the wife of his Guru, equally
<div n="lb">so the wife of his brother ({%comm.:%} the eldest wife, of the
<div n="lb">same class), and that the sister of his father and of his
<div n="lb">mother as well as his own elder sister must be saluted in
<div n="lb">the same manner as his mother, but that his paternal and
<div n="lb">maternal kinswomen are to be greeted by touching their
<div n="lb">feet only on his return from a journey. {%Gautama'%}s rule
<div n="lb">that the wives of a brother and one's own wife's mother
<div n="lb">are never to be touched in this manner is restricted by the
<div n="lb">{%Vīramitrodaya%} to the wives of the same class ({%Gaut.:%} {#nopa-#}
<div n="lb">{#saMgrahaRaM BrAtfBAryARAM SvaSrvASca;#} {%Viram.:%} {#yannopa°° iti gOta-#}
<div n="lb">{#mavAkyaM tadasavarRAvizayam#}), and when the same legislator
<div n="lb">enjoins that with the exception of a mother, the wife of a
<div n="lb">paternal uncle and a sister, no woman must be touched
<div n="lb">by her feet in being greeted except on the return from a
<div n="lb">journey, the same commentator infers that this ceremony
<div n="lb">is obligatory on the latter occasion ({%Gautama:%} {#nAviprozya#}

<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> The formula of salutation consists in general, if the
<div n="lb">person greeted is a man, of the word {#aBivAdaye#} ‘I greet’,
<div n="lb">followed by the declaration of the saluter's own name and
<div n="lb">ending with the reverential word {#BoH#} ({%Manu:%} {#aBivAdAtparaM#}

<div n="lb">bine with the declaration of the name also that of the family
<div n="lb">and the descendants when the word {#aBivAdaye#} is placed

<div n="lb">there is no other restriction ({%Gaut.:%} {#strIpuMyoge'BivAdato#}
<div n="lb">{#'niyamameke#}), but the formula becomes shortened in this way:
<div n="lb">{#aBivAdaye gArgyahaM gArgaSarmAhaM BoH#}. If the person saluted is a
<div n="lb">woman or a Śūdra or a man who either does not understand
<div n="lb">the Sanskṛt meaning of the proper name or does not know
<div n="lb">the proper manner of protracting the final vowel of the
<div n="lb">name in the return of the salutation or is otherwise igno-
<div n="lb">rant of the proper manner of returning it (see g.), the formula
<div n="lb">of the saluter is simply thus: {#‘aBivAdaye'ham’#} ‘I greet’,

<div n="lb">[{%Medhātithi%} and {%Govindarāja%} take the word {#nAma#} in the

<div n="P"><sup>d.</sup> The general rule that prevails at a salutation is that
<div n="lb">the person who receives it must be an ‘elder’ or what is
<div n="lb">technically termed a {%Guru%} and that the person who pays
<div n="lb">it must be a ‘youth’ or an inferior; such a salutation
<div n="lb">may be of course occasional, but it is a duty of a youth
<div n="lb">to salute his ‘elders’ or ‘Gurus’ every morning after
<div n="lb">he has managed the consecrated fire ({%Yājnav.:%} {#agnikAryaM#}

<div n="lb">finition of {%Devala%} who enumerates as male Gurus: the
<div n="lb">teacher (see {#upADyAya#}), the father, the eldest brother, the
<div n="lb">king, the maternal and paternal uncle, the father-in-law,
<div n="lb">an initiated householder, the maternal and paternal grand-

<div n="lb">the mother, the maternal and paternal grandmother, the
<div n="lb">sisters of father and mother, the mother-in-law, and the
<div n="lb">old nurse; and to add from the definition of others the
<div n="lb">priest (see {#ftvij#}) and the spiritual teacher (see {#AcArya#}).
<div n="lb">If there are several persons present who have a claim to a
<div n="lb">salutation, the teacher who has given instruction either on
<div n="lb">worldly or ritual or spiritual matters, has precedence be-
<div n="lb">fore all others, according to {%Manu%} ({#lOkikaM vEdikaM cApi#}
<div n="lb">{#taTADyAtmikameva ca . AdadIta yato jYAnaM taM pUrvamaBivAdayet#}),

<div n="lb">equal (as to age) for ten years, dancers and singers for five,
<div n="lb">learned theologians for three, but persons related by blood
<div n="lb">for a very short time; again, that one must consider a

<div n="lb">of a Kshatriya though aged a hundred years; therefore a
<div n="lb">friend, e. g., is not to be addressed with the words {#BoH#} or
<div n="lb">{#Bavat,#} unless he be older than ten years, and a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">must never salute first a Kshatriya or a man of a lower

<div n="lb">and so, am here’ {#asAvaham,#} and to be honoured by rising from

[Page266-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">by the name of the person who has greeted first and, if
<div n="lb">the latter is a Brāhmaṇa, the last vowel of his name, which
<div n="lb">at the same time is the last vowel of the whole phrase, be-
<div n="lb">comes protracted (according to the general rules on making
<div n="lb">vowels {#pluta#} q. v.); some require moreover, that the name
<div n="lb">should always receive the addition of the word {#Sarman,#} others,

<div n="lb">{#veti kecit . SarmAntamityapare#}); the return of the salute to
<div n="lb">a Brāhmaṇa would therefore run on the following pattern:

<div n="lb">belongs to the name, or the omission of the name altogether
<div n="lb">are rebuked by {%Kullūka%}). If the person thus addressed is
