{#aBisArikA#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-kA#}) A woman who meets her lover
<div n="lb">by assignation ({%Amarak.:%} {#kAntArTinI tu yA yAti saMketaM#}

<div n="lb">defines this character which is of frequent occurrence in
<div n="lb">poetry and affords an insight into the amorous customs
<div n="lb">of the ancient Hindus, as ‘a woman who, having lost all
<div n="lb">modesty and fear, under the influence of love or passion
<div n="lb">invites her paramour to come to her (as quoted by {%He-%}
<div n="lb">{%mach.'%}s {%comm.:%} {#hitvA lajjABaye SlizwA madanena madena vA#}--
<div n="lb">by {%Vallabhagaṇi:%} {#madena ca--. aBisArayate#}--{%Vallabh.:%}
<div n="lb">{#aBisArayedyA--kAntaM sA BavedaBisArikA#}); or as ‘one
<div n="lb">who cannot even wait for the arrival of the messenger she
<div n="lb">has sent out, but suffers unbearable pains of thirst after
<div n="lb">the water of love, desirous as she is to drink the lips of her
<div n="lb">absent friend’ ({%Vetalapanch.:%} {#yA dUtikAgamanakAlamapArayantI#}
<div n="lb">{#sA duHsahasmarajalArtipipAsiteva . niryAtavallaBajanADarapAnalo-#}
<div n="lb">{#BAtsA kaTyate munivarEraBisAriketi#}); similarly the {%Rasi-%}
<div n="lb">{%kasarvaswa%} which defines her as ‘one who having lost all
<div n="lb">modesty, attracted by her lover's youth and by love invites
<div n="lb">him to meet her’ ({#lajjAM hitvA samAkfzwA yOvanena madena ca .#}
<div n="lb">{#aBisArayate kAntaM kIrtitA sABisArikA#}); but if we follow
<div n="lb">other works on Hindu rhetoric, this definition would only
<div n="lb">apply to the second or the last of the three categories of the
<div n="lb">{#aBisArikA,#} as mentioned e. g. by the {%Sāhityadarpaṇa%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Saṅgītadāmodara;%} the former of which works, after having
<div n="lb">prefaced the definition that ‘wise men call {%abhisārikā%} a woman
<div n="lb">who under the dominion of love either invites her lover to
<div n="lb">come to her or goes herself to him’ ({#aBisArayate kAntaM yA#}

<div n="lb">tinguishes between gentle-women who go to meet their lovers,
<div n="lb">courtesans and servant girls; ‘the gentle-woman will make
<div n="lb">herself on such occasions as small as possible, deafen the
<div n="lb">noise of her ornaments and wrap herself up in a veil; the
<div n="lb">courtesan will make a display of gay apparel, her ankle-
<div n="lb">ornaments will merrily tinkle and her face smile with joy;
<div n="lb">if a servant girl goes to meet her lover, her speech will
<div n="lb">stammer with delight, her eyes stare wide open with flurry,
<div n="lb">and her gait will be awkwardly bewildered’ ({%Sāhityad.:%}

<div n="lb">But the rhetorico-musical work {%Saṅgītadāmodara%} is appa-
<div n="lb">rently more in keeping with the general division of amorous
<div n="lb">ladies (see {#nAyikA#}) into such as are their own mis-
<div n="lb">tresses, or such as belong to another (as a married
<div n="lb">woman and a maiden) and such as belong to every body
<div n="lb">(comp. {#svastrI, anyastrI#} and {#sADAraRastrI#}), when it sub-
<div n="lb">stitutes for the servant girl the second category; for its
<div n="lb">story runs thus: ‘the gentle-woman goes to the lover's
<div n="lb">house wrapped up, afraid, bashful, concealing her emotions,
<div n="lb">confused (?), with downcast looks; a married woman will
<div n="lb">go to him her speech somewhat stammering, her eye glaring
<div n="lb">wide open with flurry, her gait awkwardly bewildered,
<div n="lb">with slow steps, and no one will see her; but a courtesan
<div n="lb">walks up to her lover in the company of a friend, full
<div n="lb">of passion, her eyes trembling, fearless, decorated with
<div n="lb">all kind of ornaments, surrounded by people, with tinkling
<div n="lb">anklets: (in short) just as she pleases’. This work tells
<div n="lb">us besides that some of these ladies prefer assignations
<div n="lb">during the light half of a month, i. e. from new to full
<div n="lb">moon,--hence called {#SuklABisArikAH#} or dames of the
<div n="lb">light fortnight--and others during the dark half, when
<div n="lb">the moon is in the wane--hence called {#kfzRABisArikAH#}
<div n="lb">or dames of the dark fortnight; the former wear garlands
<div n="lb">of Arabian jasmine, are anointed all over with Sandal
<div n="lb">preparations and dressed in silk, but do not make their
<div n="lb">appearance by moon-light; the latter are anointed with
<div n="lb">black aloe unguents, are fond of dark colours, and are
<div n="lb">also afraid of the moon-rise; ({#kulajAnyANganA veSyA triDA#}

<div n="lb">a great festival, and in the evening’, for it seems ‘that on
<div n="lb">such occasions the cowkeeper girls as well as the dames of
<div n="lb">the dark as those of the light fortnight had their amatory
<div n="lb">sport with Kṛṣṇa’; (but their meeting at moon-rise is
