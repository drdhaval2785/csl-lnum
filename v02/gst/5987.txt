<div n="lb">{#hatamanA vaDyate;#} or {%Bhaṭṭik.:%} {#indrajidvikramABijYo manvAno#}
<div n="lb">{#vAnaraM jitam…agAt#} &c.; when not compounded with
<div n="lb">a preceding noun, the object of knowledge stands in the
<div n="lb">genit. or locat.; thus the comm. of the {%Bhaṭṭik.%} explain
<div n="lb">{#viyogaduHKAnuBAvAnaBijYEH, viyogaduHKasya yo'nuBavaH .#}
<div n="lb">{#anuBavanam . tasyAnaBijYEH#} or {#tatrAnaBijYEH#}. E. {#jYA#} with {#aBi,#}

<div n="P">2. f. ({#-jYA#}) <sup>1</sup> Remembrance, recollection ({%Kāśikā:%} =

<div n="lb">{#dAya vikziptacittasattvaparipAcanatAyE saMvartate#}. <sup>2</sup> (In Buddhistic
<div n="lb">doctrine.) Supernatural knowledge, a supernatural faculty
<div n="lb">attached to the Arhatship; there are five, or according to
<div n="lb">some six, such faculties viz. 1. the faculty of divine sight,
<div n="lb">i. e. the faculty of seeing, without obstacle, all beings and
<div n="lb">bodies, of whatever kind, in the totality of the worlds;
<div n="lb">2. that of divine hearing, i. e. the faculty of understanding
<div n="lb">all words of joy or grief uttered by the beings, and all
<div n="lb">sounds of whatever kind uttered in all the worlds (or ‘the
<div n="lb">power to hear all sounds whether distant or near, whether
<div n="lb">made by devas or men’: {%Spence Hardy'%}s {%Eastern Monachism%});
<div n="lb">3. that of knowing the thoughts of other beings; 4. that
<div n="lb">of knowing former existences or what births have been
<div n="lb">got in former ages; 5. magic power or the power to
<div n="lb">assume any shape, to pass without obstacle over seas and
<div n="lb">mountains, and to disappear from one world for the sake
<div n="lb">of reappearing in another; to these some add: 6. {%āśra-%}
<div n="lb">{%vakshaya,%} (which according to {%Burnouf%} probably means)
<div n="lb">the power of destroying defects or vices. (See {%Burnouf'%}s
<div n="lb">{%Lotus de la bonne loi%} p. 820 seqq.; there is a difference be-
<div n="lb">tween this enumeration and that of {%Hardy%} in his {%Eastern%}
<div n="lb">{%Monachism%} (p. 284): he has but five {%abhijnās,%} identifies the
<div n="lb">magic power and the {%āśravakṣaya%} without defining how-
<div n="lb">ever either term, omits the first (the faculty of divine
<div n="lb">sight) and has an {%abhijnā%} not named by {%Burnouf:%} the
<div n="lb">power of knowing what births will be received in fu-
<div n="lb">ture ages). Compare {#zaqaBijYa#}. E. {#jYA#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt
<div n="lb">aff. {#aN;#} (but meaning 2. is probably better analyzed
<div n="lb">{#aBi#} and {#jYA#}).
