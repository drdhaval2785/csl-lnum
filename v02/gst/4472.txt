{#ap#}¦ f. ({#-p;#} in the classical literature only used in the plural:
<div n="lb">{#-ApaH-apaH-adBiH-adByaH-apAm-apsu#}) <sup>1</sup> Water.--Ac-
<div n="lb">cording to the Hindu doctrine it is one of the five elements
<div n="lb">the several denominations of which are {#AkASa#} (æther),
<div n="lb">{#vAyu#} (air), {#agni#} (fire), {#ap#} (water), {#pfTivI#} (earth), (each
<div n="lb">of these being also replaced by synonymes, as {#AkASa#}
<div n="lb">by {#vyoman, vAyu#} by {#marut, agni#} by {#tejas, ap#} by
<div n="lb">{#vAri, pfTivI#} by {#kziti#} &c.; comp. under {#AkASa#} &c.); the
<div n="lb">place, however, which {%water%} holds in the Hindu cosmogony
<div n="lb">varies according to the doctrines. Thus the {%Bṛhad-Āraṇ-%}
<div n="lb">{%yaka Upan.%} represents it as the first material creation, it
<div n="lb">being produced by Death after the creation of Soul; but
<div n="lb">its character in this Upanishad is not yet that of an element
<div n="lb">in the later sense of the word; nor is it such an element in
<div n="lb">the {%Aitareya-Upan.,%} where the order of the primitive ma-
<div n="lb">terial creation is {#amBas#} (the waters above the heavens),
<div n="lb">{#marIci#} (the sphere of sunbeams or atmosphere), {#mara#} (the
<div n="lb">sphere of death or earth) and {#ap#} (the sphere of waters
<div n="lb">beneath the earth).--In the {%Taittirīya-Upan.%} the order and
<div n="lb">successive origin of the elements is the same as in the Ve-
<div n="lb">dānta, viz. æther, in which originates air and thus suc-
<div n="lb">cessively fire, water, earth. But the {%Vedānta%} complicates
<div n="lb">this simple view by assuming a creation of subtle elements
<div n="lb">(see {#sUkzmaSarIra#}) æther &c., produced by Chaitanya or the
<div n="lb">worldly Brahman, whence arise through an intricate division
<div n="lb">and combination of the several parts of each, the material
<div n="lb">elements (see {#sTUlaSarIra#}) æther &c.; this system holds more-
<div n="lb">over that each successive element becomes possessed of the
<div n="lb">qualities of each preceding one, i. e. the quality of æther
<div n="lb">being sound, air obtains the qualities of sound and touch,
<div n="lb">and in a similar progress, fire the qualities of sound, touch
<div n="lb">and form, water of sound, touch, form and savour, earth
<div n="lb">of sound, touch, form, savour and odour.--According to
<div n="lb">the {%Sāṅkhya%} the coarse elements also arise from subtle ele-
<div n="lb">ments, but the latter ({#tanmAtra#} q. v.), produced by Ahaṅkāra
<div n="lb">or the type of {%I,%} are the qualities sound, touch, form,
<div n="lb">savour and odour, æther proceeding from sound, air from
<div n="lb">touch, fire from form, water from savour and earth from
<div n="lb">odour. (Compare also Suśruta's mythological developement
<div n="lb">of the Sāṅkhya-Yoga: {#avyaktaM mahAnahaMkAraH paYca tanmAtrARi ce-#}
<div n="lb">{#tyazwO prakftayaH SezAH zoqaSa vikArAH . svaH svaScEzAM vizayo'Di-#}

<div n="lb">{#zoH . rasanasyApaH . pfTivI GrARasya .#} &c.)--The {%Nyāya%}
<div n="lb">systems, more especially the {%Vaiśeṣika,%} do not discuss the
<div n="lb">origin of these elements, the order of which they retain,
[Page156-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">but attach themselves chiefly to the definition of their
<div n="lb">properties; accord. to the {%Vaiśeṣika%} the qualities of water
<div n="lb">are touch, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, dis-
<div n="lb">junction, greater or less comprehensiveness (extension), ve-
<div n="lb">locity, gravity, fluidity, colour, savour and viscidity. (For
<div n="lb">those of the other elements see s. vv. {#AkASa#} &c.) The cos-
<div n="lb">mogony of {%Manu%} which is neither the pure Sāṅkhya nor the
<div n="lb">pure Vedānta doctrine (although Kullūka endeavours to ex-
<div n="lb">plain his terms as if they were pure Vedānta terms), but
<div n="lb">a theory apparently prior to both and combining their views,
<div n="lb">imagines the coarse elements as proceeding from the subtle
<div n="lb">portions of the seven intellectual creations--{#puruzAH#} which
<div n="lb">are, according to Kullūka, {#ahaMkAra, mahat#} and the five
<div n="lb">subtle elements(?)--and endowed with the same qualities
<div n="lb">as assigned to them by the Vedānta.--According to the
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇupurāṇa%} ‘elementary Egotism (the type of {%I,%} {#ahaMkAra#})
<div n="lb">becoming productive as the rudiment of sound, produced
<div n="lb">from it æther, of which sound is the characteristic, invest-
<div n="lb">ing it with its rudiment of sound; æther becoming produc-
<div n="lb">tive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated
<div n="lb">strong wind, the property of which is touch; and æther
<div n="lb">with the rudiment of sound, enveloped the rudiment of
<div n="lb">touch; then wind becoming productive, produced the rudi-
<div n="lb">ment of form (colour); whence fire proceeded of which form
<div n="lb">is the attribute, and the rudiment of touch enveloped the
<div n="lb">wind with the rudiment of colour; fire becoming productive
<div n="lb">produced the rudiment of savour, whence proceed all juices
<div n="lb">in which savour resides, and the rudiment of colour invested
<div n="lb">the juices with the rudiment of savour; the waters becoming
<div n="lb">productive engendered the rudiment of smell; whence an
<div n="lb">aggregate (earth) originates, of which smell is the property.’
<div n="lb">In a note to this passage ({%Viṣṇup.%} p. 16) Professor Wilson
<div n="lb">observes that ‘the successive series of rudiments and ele-
<div n="lb">ments and their respectively engendering the rudiments and
<div n="lb">elements next in order occur in most of the Purāṇas in
<div n="lb">nearly the same words’, that ‘some of the Purāṇas, as the
<div n="lb">{%Matsya, Vāyu, Linga, Bhāgavata%} and {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} add a
<div n="lb">description of a participation of properties amongst the ele-
<div n="lb">ments, which is rather Vedānta than Sāṅkhya’ and mentions
<div n="lb">a passage of the Moksha Dharma (vv. 6778. 6779) of the
<div n="lb">Māhābhārata which is an exception, since its order of the
<div n="lb">elements is æther, water, fire, air, earth. [On the cosmo-
<div n="lb">gony of the chapter in which these latter verses occur, Arju-
<div n="lb">namiśra has the following gloss: {#ko'yaM sargaprakAraH . na hi#}
<div n="lb">{#sANKyAdisargezvayaM kramaH . ucyate . anyo'yaM prakAraH sargasya .#}
<div n="lb">{#pOrARikAdisaMmatezu#} &c.; but he omits to say which Pu-
<div n="lb">rāṇas give this anomalous order of the elements.] For the
<div n="lb">Bhāgav. Pur. comp. III. 26. 29. ff. and the two verses VII.

<div n="lb">{#hati tadavyakte'kzare ca tat#} (this reverted order being that in
<div n="lb">which dissolution takes place).--In the Vedas, however,
<div n="lb">{#apAM garBaH#} ‘the child of the waters’ is an epithet of Agni,
<div n="lb">‘because he comes forth from amid the waters’ or ‘because
<div n="lb">he resides as lightning amidst the rain-waters’ (according to
[Page156-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">Mahīdhara); comp. also {#garBo apasAm#} s. v. {#apas;#} from the
