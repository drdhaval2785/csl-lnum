{#anuzuka#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-kaH#}) Probably the epithet of a divinity;
<div n="lb">the same as {#Anuzuka#}. (Some read instead of this word {#anu-#}
<div n="lb">{#sUyaka#} which seems to be wrong, others {#anuzUka#} which is
<div n="lb">doubtful. Compare also {#Anusuka#}.) E. The Gaṇaratnama-
<div n="lb">hodadhi derives {#anuzuka#} from {#anusU#} and {#ka#} (from {#kE#}) with
<div n="lb">a short vowel before {#kaH anuzuvatIti anuzU . taM kAyatIti#}
<div n="lb">{#anuzuka . ke'Ra iti hrasvatve;#} this application, however, of
<div n="lb">Pāṇ. VII. 4. 13. to the etym. given, seems very objectionable.
