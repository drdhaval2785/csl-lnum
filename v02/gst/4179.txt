[{#anyaka#}.¦ N. B. The forms {#anyake, anyakezAm#} are not to be re-
<div n="lb">ferred to a base {#anyaka,#} but belong to {#anya#} q. v. which word
<div n="lb">like other {#sarvanAman#} q. v. may assume the affix {#akac#} placed
<div n="lb">before the endings. Such is the theory of Pāṇini, and it is
<div n="lb">countenanced not only by the pronominal declension endings
<div n="lb">of {#anyake#} &c. but by the analogy of a similar intrusion of
<div n="lb">{#ka#} in the middle of verbal forms such as {#BindDaki, CindDaki#}
<div n="lb">‘he cuts badly or a little’.]
