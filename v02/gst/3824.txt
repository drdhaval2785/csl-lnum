{#antareRa#}¦ ind. Used as an adverb and as preposition with the

<div n="P">I. (adv.) In the middle.
<div n="P">II. (prepos.) 1. <sup>1</sup> Amidst. <sup>2</sup> During. <sup>3</sup> [With regard to,
<div n="lb">on behalf of..?.] 2. <sup>1</sup> Without. <sup>2</sup> Except. [The comm. of
<div n="lb">Pāṇini restrict the construction of {#antareRa#} with the accus. to
<div n="lb">the meanings {#‘maDye’#} and {#‘vinA’#} rendered II. 1. 1. 2. and 2. 1. 2.,
<div n="lb">thus excluding II. 1. 3. In conformity with this restriction
<div n="lb">Bharata on Amarak. s. v. {#antara#} instances {#tavAntareRarRaM gf-#}
<div n="lb">{#hItam = tvadarTam#} &c. (not {#tvAmantareRa°#}), thus referring
<div n="lb">{#antareRa#} to the noun {#antara,#} not to the preposition. It may
<div n="lb">be observed, moreover, that in the only {%Sanskṛt%} passage
<div n="lb">which is quoted in support of the meaning ‘on behalf of’
<div n="lb">viz. Śakunt. in the beginning of the 5th act, {#‘tadasyA devIM#}
<div n="lb">{#vasumatImantareRa mahadupAlamBanaM gato'smi’,#} the reading given

<div n="lb">portion by subsequent editions, viz. {#tadahaM devIM haMsavatI-#}
<div n="lb">{#mantareRa#} &c., would render the passage itself less obscure
<div n="lb">than it is with the word {#vasumatI#} and allow {#antareRa#} to retain
<div n="lb">its legitimate construction in the sense ‘without’: ‘therefore,

<div n="lb">Williams p. 81) {#BavantamantareRa#} is explained by one comm.
<div n="lb">{#Bavannimittam#} but, in conformity with Pāṇini, by another
<div n="lb">{#BavanmaDye;#} in the Calc. and Chézy's ed. the words are {#tuha#}
<div n="lb">{#ubari#} and the whole passage is Prākṛt. In some {%Prākṛt%}
