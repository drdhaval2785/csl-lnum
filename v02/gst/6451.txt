<div n="lb">day of the first or light fortnight of the month Phālguna
<div n="lb">(February-March); it consists of several ceremonies which
<div n="lb">last five days, the first or {#dIkzA#} occupying one day, the
<div n="lb">{#upasad#} offerings three days and the {#sutyA#} one day. The
<div n="lb">officiating priest who performs the initiatory rites and
<div n="lb">chants the Sāmav.-hymns specified in {%Maśaka'%}s {%Kalpasūtras,%}
<div n="lb">must be a Brāhmaṇa of the family of {%Bhṛgu.%} The principal
<div n="lb">ceremonies of this sacrifice (in which seem to have originated
<div n="lb">those of the {#aBizeka#} q. v.) are the following: after the
<div n="lb">initiatory rites have been performed and the {%Adhwaryu%}
<div n="lb">priest has summoned the king who performs the Rājasūya
<div n="lb">sacrifice, in proclaiming his name, the name of his father
<div n="lb">and mother and that of his kingdom, he takes seventeen
<div n="lb">kinds of liquid with vessels made of {%Udumbara%} (Ficus glo-
<div n="lb">merata) wood, viz. he takes 1. water of the river Sarasvatī,
<div n="lb">which he places in a well screened place; 2. having pro-
<div n="lb">vided himself with as much clarified butter as is sufficient
<div n="lb">for a full libation and gone into a pond, and having sent
<div n="lb">there a man or a beast, he pours into the first wave which
<div n="lb">is roused by either of them in an eastern direction, the
<div n="lb">clarified butter and then takes the water of that wave; 3. he
<div n="lb">repeats the same process with the second wave which is
<div n="lb">roused in a western direction; 4. he then takes river-water
[Page288-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">in the direction with the stream and 5. against the stream,
<div n="lb">6. river-water which has broke out and formed a separate
<div n="lb">stream, 7. sea-water, 8. water from a whirlpool, 9. water from
<div n="lb">a deep lake, 10. water proceding from rain during sunshine,
<div n="lb">before it has fallen down, 11. water from small tanks, 12. well-
<div n="lb">water, 13. ice- or dew-water; ({%Śrīdeva%} observes that it must
<div n="lb">be collected in places where there is much dry grass,
<div n="lb">by throwing a clean garment over it and afterwards by
<div n="lb">wringing it out in a cup); 14. honey, 15. water proceeding
<div n="lb">from the membranes investing the fœtus of a cow which
<div n="lb">has calved, 16. milk, 17. clarified butter; ({%Śrīdeva%} observes
<div n="lb">that the water of the Sarasvatī and all water which is not
<div n="lb">at hand as well as the water which can only be had con-
<div n="lb">ditionally, e. g. that of 10. 13 15., must be first procured and
<div n="lb">then the other kinds). He then catches, at it were, sun beams
<div n="lb">with the hollow of his hand and joins them with each of the
<div n="lb">seventeen liquids while repeating severally the hymns he
<div n="lb">has recited before, when collecting each water. Then, he
<div n="lb">pours these liquids into one vase made of {%Udumbara-%}
<div n="lb">wood, arranges four vases made severally of {%Palāśa%}-(Butea
<div n="lb">frondosa), {%Udumbara-,%} the pendant branch of the {%Ficus%}
<div n="lb">{%Indica-,%} and {%Aśvattha-%} (Ficus religiosa) wood, spreads
<div n="lb">out before them a tiger-skin and distributes the water col-
<div n="lb">lected in the one vase, into the four sacrificial vases. Next
<div n="lb">follows the toilet of the king who takes off the garments
<div n="lb">he wore at the preparation for the sacrifice, and now is
<div n="lb">clad by the Adhwaryu in a silk under garment and over
<div n="lb">it in a red and white cloak; on his head the priest places
<div n="lb">the royal turban ({%uṣṇīṣa%}), fastening both its ends to his
<div n="lb">waist; and in his hands the bow, which he strings, and
<div n="lb">three arrows. Then he throws copper into the face of a
<div n="lb">long-haired eunuch who sits in the midst of the assembly and
<div n="lb">represents the various kinds of death. These rites having been
<div n="lb">performed, the Adhwaryu invites the king to step on the
<div n="lb">tiger-skin, placing under his feet a golden circle and another
<div n="lb">golden circle perforated with nine or a hundred holes on his
<div n="lb">head; then he lifts up the arms of the king, and while the
<div n="lb">latter is thus standing with his face towards the east, either he
<div n="lb">or the royal family priest drops the contents of the Palāśa
<div n="lb">vase over him; then the king's brother drops over him the
<div n="lb">water contained in the Udumbara vase; then a Kshatriya
<div n="lb">friend the water in the third vase, and lastly a Vaiśya
<div n="lb">the water in the Aśvattha vase. The Hotṛ then having
<div n="lb">recited the legend of Śunaḥśepa, the king gives to the
<div n="lb">Adhwaryu and to him severally a hundred or a thousand
<div n="lb">cows as well as gold, food and cloth; he then rubs the
<div n="lb">consecrated water which remains on his body, over himself
<div n="lb">with a black-horn-brush, makes three steps on the tiger-
<div n="lb">skin at the hand of the Adhwaryu, and having poured the
<div n="lb">remainder of the consecrated liquid into the Palāśa vase
<div n="lb">hands it to his favourite son. After a libation of clarified
<div n="lb">butter the Adhwaryu then proclaims the name of the king
<div n="lb">coupling with it, however, this time the name of the son
<div n="lb">(by saying e. g. ‘here is Daśaratha, the father of Rāma’).
<div n="lb">The subsequent ceremonies refer to the preparation of a
<div n="lb">carriage, the putting to it of a team of horses &c., the
[Page288-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">giving of cows to the king's brother, the king's mounting
<div n="lb">the car, tying on his feet a pair of shoes made of boar's
<div n="lb">skin, giving to his bow-bearer the bow with the three ar-
<div n="lb">rows and after various other rites, playing a game of shells,
<div n="lb">five shells having been handed to him by the Adhwaryu,
<div n="lb">with his brother, his charioteer ({%sūta%}) or his architect ({%stha-%}
<div n="lb">{%pati%}) and his military chief, the shells being either made
<div n="lb">of gold, or the fruits of Beleric myrobalan serving as such
<div n="lb">({%Sāyaṇa%} on the {%Śatap.:%} {#akzA nAma kapardakAH suvarRanirmitAH .#}
<div n="lb">{#viBItakaPalAni sOvarRA vetyeke#}) and the game representing
<div n="lb">the victory of the Kali age over the other ages; the cere-
<div n="lb">mony closes with libations in the fire. (The Mīmānsists
<div n="lb">do not consider the recital of the legend of Śunaḥśepa and
<div n="lb">the game of shells as special parts of the Abhiṣechanīya,
<div n="lb">but as rites belonging in general to the whole Rājasūya
<div n="lb">sacrifice. For the full detail of the ceremony and the
<div n="lb">hymns to be recited at the various rites see {%Śatapathabr.%}
<div n="lb">V. 3. 3. 1.--4. 4. 25. and {%Kātyāyana'%}s {%Śrautas.%} book 15,
<div n="lb">4-7.). E. {#aBizecana,#} taddh. aff. {#Ca#} (II. 2. scil. {#somayAga#});
<div n="lb">({%Mādhava,%} however, who uses also the term {#aBizecya#} as
<div n="lb">the name of the ceremony, seems to consider the word as
<div n="lb">a Tatpur. like {#aBizecanIya#} I.).
