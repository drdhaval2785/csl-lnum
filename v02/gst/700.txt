{#aNgiras#}¦ I. m. sing. ({#-rAH#}) The proper name of a Maharshi,
<div n="lb">a great Ṛṣi or saint who is the reputed author of many
<div n="lb">vaidik hymns, but who is mentioned also in a subse-
[Page020-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">quent period as one of the inspired legislators of India
<div n="lb">and as the author of an astronomical work. The various
<div n="lb">legends connected with his life seem to have been occasioned
<div n="lb">by the word {#aNgiras#} coming from the same radical as,
<div n="lb">and its sound recalling that of, {#agni,#} fire (q. v.). Hence
<div n="lb">we find Angiras sometimes either as an epithet or as the
<div n="lb">father of Agni, and the Saint himself connected chiefly with
<div n="lb">such hymns as are addressed to Agni, to Indra or to dei-
<div n="lb">ties of a kindred description: a portion of the fourth Veda,
<div n="lb">the Atharvan, reports him also as an expounder of the
<div n="lb">Brahmavidyā (q. v.) or the sacred knowledge, that had been
<div n="lb">imparted to him by Satyavāha, a descendant of Bharadvāja.
<div n="lb">(See {#aNgir#}.) Though Angiras, as may be concluded from his
<div n="lb">name being connected with the authorship of a great por-
<div n="lb">tion of the sacred Hindu literature, appears to have been
<div n="lb">one of the oldest civilizers of India, no historical date is
<div n="lb">to be obtained from the epic or pauranik literature where
<div n="lb">the vaidik legends of his life are merely amplified; there
<div n="lb">he is named as one of the Prajāpatis or progenitors of
<div n="lb">mankind engendered, according to some by Manu, accord-
<div n="lb">ing to others by Brahmā himself, either with the female
<div n="lb">half of his body or from his mouth or from the space
<div n="lb">between his eye-brows. As such he is considered also as
<div n="lb">one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside over the reign of the
<div n="lb">first Manu or Svāyambhuva. He is called, besides, the priest
<div n="lb">of the Gods, the Lord of the sacrifice &c. Sometimes he
<div n="lb">is considered as a son of Uru by Āgneyī, the daughter of
<div n="lb">Agni. His daughters are the Ṛchas (or vaidik hymns) and
<div n="lb">also, Śaśvatī, Sinīvālī, Kuhū, Rākā, Anumati; his sons
<div n="lb">are Samvarta, the manes called Havishmats, Utathya,
<div n="lb">Bṛhaspati, Mārkanḍeya; his wives, Smṛti (traditional
<div n="lb">science), two daughters of Daksha, Svadhā and Satī, and
<div n="lb">Śraddhā, the daughter of the sage Kardama. As an astro-
<div n="lb">nomical personification he is Bṛhaspati himself or the regent
<div n="lb">of the planet Jupiter and presides over the sixth year of
<div n="lb">the cycle of sixty years. See also {#aTarvan#}.
<div n="P">II. m. pl. ({#-rasaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of the former. In this
<div n="lb">capacity they share also in the nature of the legends attri-
<div n="lb">buted to Angiras. Angiras being the father of Agni, they
<div n="lb">are considered as descendants of Agni himself, who is also
<div n="lb">called the first of the Angirasas. Like Angiras, they occur
<div n="lb">in hymns addressed to the luminous deities and, at a later
<div n="lb">period, they become for the most part personifications of
<div n="lb">light, of luminous bodies, of divisions of time, of celestial
<div n="lb">phenomena and fires adapted to peculiar occasions as the
<div n="lb">full and change of the moon, or to particular rites as the
<div n="lb">Aśvamedha, Rājasūya, the Pākayajnas or sacrifices with
<div n="lb">food, obsequial and funeral fires, expiatory fires, and the
<div n="lb">like. Most of the authors of the hymns of the Rigveda are
<div n="lb">connected with them and in the Purāṇas mention is made of
<div n="lb">two tribes of the Angirasas which were Brāhmaṇas as well
<div n="lb">as Kshatriyas. <sup>2</sup> The hymns of the Atharvaveda. See also
<div n="lb">{#aTarvan#} pl. and {#aTarvANgiras#} pl. E. {#aNg,#} uṇ. aff. {#asi#} with
<div n="lb">āgama {#iruw,#} or, according to another authority, a Tatpur.
<div n="lb">composed of {#an#} (meaning {#anna#} food, from {#an#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#})
<div n="lb">and {#giras#} (from {#gF#} to swallow) ‘devouring food’. The latter
[Page020-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">etymology, apparently without any grammatical authority,
<div n="lb">would refer especially to {#aNgiras#} as epithet of Agni. See
<div n="lb">also {#aNgirastama#}. The plural {#aNgirasaH#} is considered, though
<div n="lb">without any etymological necessity, as the plural of the
<div n="lb">deriv. form {#ANgirasa#} with luk or elision of the affix.
