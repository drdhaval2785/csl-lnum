{#anuveDa#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-DaH#}). The same as {#anuvyADa#} q. v. E. In
<div n="lb">following the native lexicographical etym. of {#veDa,#} this word
<div n="lb">would come from {#viD#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY,#} the radical
<div n="lb">{#viD#} assuming in this derivative the meaning of {#vyaD;#} it will
<div n="lb">appear however that the form {#veDa#} in the meaning of {#vyaDa,#}
<div n="lb">and {#anuveDa#} in that of {#anuvyADa#} are objectionable, from a
<div n="lb">gramm. point of view, since {#viD#} does not occur otherwise
<div n="lb">in the meaning “to pierce” and {#veDa#} is not mentioned by
<div n="lb">the best gramm. authorities as a derivative of either {#viD#}
<div n="lb">or {#vyaD#}.
