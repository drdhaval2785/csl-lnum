{#aBavanmatayoga#}¦ I. Karmadh. m. ({#-gaH#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of
<div n="lb">the twenty one defects to be avoided in the composition of
<div n="lb">a sentence (see {#doza#} and {#vAkyadoza#}); viz. not conveying ac-
<div n="lb">curately by a sentence the intended sense, <sup>a.</sup> by connecting
<div n="lb">syntactically words which have no logical relation to each
<div n="lb">other, or <sup>b.</sup> by disconnecting syntactically words which are
<div n="lb">logically connected, or <sup>c.</sup> by erring in the mode of con-
<div n="lb">nexion; e. g. <sup>a.</sup> in the sentence {#yezAM tAstridaSeBadAnasaritaH#}
<div n="lb">{#pItAH pratApozmaBirlIlApAnaBuvaSca candanatarucCAyAsu yEH ka-#}
<div n="lb">{#lpitAH . yezAM huMkftayaH kftAmarapatikzoBAH kzapAcAriRAM kiM#}
<div n="lb">{#tEstvatparitozakAri vihitaM kiMcitpravAdocitam#} there is no
<div n="lb">logical relation between the words in the relative and those
<div n="lb">in the correlative sentence; or in the sentence {#anena cCi-#}
<div n="lb">{#ndatA mAtuH kaRWaM paraSunA tava . badDasparSaH kfpARo'yaM la-#}
<div n="lb">{#jjate mama BArgava,#} the word {#paraSu,#} although intended to ex-
<div n="lb">press the reason, has no logical connexion with the blame
[Page235-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">uttered against Paraśurāma; (thus the old critics: the mo-
<div n="lb">dern critics however find no fault with this sentence); or
<div n="lb"><sup>b.</sup> in the verse {#yA jayaSrIrmanojasya yayA jagadalaMkftam . yAme-#}
<div n="lb">{#RAkzIM vinA prARA viPalA me kuto'dya sA,#} the word {#eRA-#}
<div n="lb">{#kzIm#} ought to stand in the correlative sentence so as to
<div n="lb">become connected with the {%three%} preceding relative sen-
<div n="lb">tences which it is not now; (the {%Sāhityad.%} proposes to mend
<div n="lb">the latter part of this Śloka thus: {#yAM vinAmI vfTA prARA#}
<div n="lb">{#eRAkzI sA kuto'dya me#}); or <sup>c.</sup> in the verse {#jyotsnA ca yaH#}
<div n="lb">{#payaHpUrastArakAH kEravARi ca . rAjati vyomakAsArarAjahaMsaH#}
<div n="lb">{#suDAkaraH,#} the word {#kAsAra#} standing in the same relation
<div n="lb">to {#vyoma,#} as {#payaHpUra#} to {#jyotsnA#} &c., it ought not to be part
<div n="lb">of a compound, as this kind of syntax would affect the
<div n="lb">whole simile; or in the sentence {#Ikzase yatkawAkzeRa tadA DanvI#}
<div n="lb">{#manoBavaH#} the connexion between the two sentences ought
<div n="lb">not to have been effected by {#yad--tadA,#} but by {#cet--#}
<div n="lb">{#tadA#}. See also {#aBavanmatasaMbanDa#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. n. ({#-gam#}) A sentence in which this defect
<div n="lb">occurs. E. {#a-Bavat-mata#} and {#yoga;#} the Bahuvr. scil. {#vAkya;#}
<div n="lb">(the word does not occur as a Karmadh., but only as a
<div n="lb">Bahuvr., in the {%Kāvyaprakāśa;%} comp. the following).
