<div n="lb">commentator also used in the adjective sense:) fit or able
<div n="lb">to draw a cart, as an epithet of a goat; but this expla-
<div n="lb">nation seems doubtful.--(The use of the femin. {#anaqvAhI#}
<div n="lb">would be restricted, according to one authority, to the
<div n="lb">Vedas, while others do not make any distinction between
<div n="lb">this form and {#anaquhI#}. In Avyayībh. compounds, the com-
<div n="lb">pound terminating with {#anaquh#} assumes the samāsānta aff.

<div n="lb">sānta aff. {#kap#} (see {#anaqutka#}); in the latter, however, it

<div n="lb">{#anaqvAMhi#}.) E. {#anas,#} with {#s#} changed to {#q,#} and {#vah#} (from
