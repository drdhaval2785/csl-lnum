{#agasti#}¦ m. ({#-stiH#}) <sup>1</sup> The name of a saint and reputed author
<div n="lb">of several hymns of the Rigveda, celebrated in Hindu my-
<div n="lb">thology, more usually entitled Agastya, and considered as
<div n="lb">the son of both Mitra and Varuṇa, by Urvaśī; hence his
<div n="lb">names Maitrāvaruṇi and Aurvaśīya. He is represented of
<div n="lb">short stature, and is said by some to have been born in a
<div n="lb">water jar; hence his names Kumbhasambhava, Ghaṭod-
<div n="lb">bhava &c. He is famed for having swallowed the ocean,
<div n="lb">when it had given him offence, wherefore he is called Pī-
<div n="lb">tābdhi. At his command the Vindhya range of mountains
<div n="lb">prostrated itself, and so remains; hence his present appel-
<div n="lb">lation. He is also mentioned as one of the oldest medical
<div n="lb">authors, considered as the civilisor of the South and as
<div n="lb">the regent of the star Canopus. <sup>2</sup> The name of a tree
<div n="lb">(Sesbana grandiflora). <sup>3</sup> m. plur. {#agastayaH#} are the descendants
<div n="lb">of Agasti. See {#Agastya#}. E. {#aga#} (mountain) and {#as#} (to
<div n="lb">throw), uṇ. aff. {#ti--:#} Agastya having ordered the Vindhya
<div n="lb">mountain to prostrate itself before him; or according to
<div n="lb">others, a Tatpur. composed of {#aga#} (water jar) and {#stya#}
<div n="lb">(from {#styE#} to condense): from his being kept and born in a wa-
<div n="lb">ter jar. (Both etymologies are apparently artificial and with-
<div n="lb">out any grammatical evidence.) See also {#agastya#} and {#agastI#}.
