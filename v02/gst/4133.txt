{#annamala#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-lam#}) <sup>1</sup> Offal, sweepings. <sup>2</sup> The worst
<div n="lb">kind of spirituous liquor, viz. {#surA#}. [The latter meaning
<div n="lb">requires an explanation: Manu 11. 93 says: {#surA vE mala-#}
<div n="lb">{#mannAnAM#} &c. and forbids the drinking of the spirituous liquor
<div n="lb">{#surA#} to a man of the three first castes; Kullūka in his com-
<div n="lb">ment seems to take {#malamannAnAM#} or {#annamala#} in the general sense
<div n="lb">of ‘extract of rice’, because {#surA#} is made from the flower of
<div n="lb">rice ({#taRqulapizwasADyatvAtsurA annamalam#}); but Pulastya, as
<div n="lb">quoted by Vijnāneśvara in the Mitākṣara names twelve
<div n="lb">sorts of intoxicating drinks, stating that {#surA#} is the very
<div n="lb">worst description amongst them: {#pAnasaM drAkzaM mADUkaM KArjUraM#}

<div n="lb">{#nAni vijAnIyAnmadyAnyekAdaSEva tu . dvAdaSaM tu surAmadyaM sarve-#}
<div n="lb">{#zAmaDamaM smftam;#} and Vijnāneśvara in commenting upon the
<div n="lb">quoted passage of Manu and adducing Pāṇ. II. 1. 34. where
<div n="lb">the word {#anna#} means a preparation of rice &c. observes
<div n="lb">that it is intended to convey in this passage the sense of
<div n="lb">spirituous liquor, the latter being also an {#annavikAra#} or
<div n="lb">preparation of rice, and {#surA#} being used also in the Sautrā-
<div n="lb">maṇī libations in the sense of spirituous liquor made of rice:
<div n="lb">{#‘surA vE malamannAnAM pApmA ca malamucyata iti . annavikAra-#}
