{#antaHkalpa#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-lpaH#}) A cycle of the Buddhistic era.
<div n="lb">‘From the time that man's age increases from ten years to
<div n="lb">an Asankhya and again decreases from an Asankhya to
<div n="lb">ten years, is an Antaḥkalpa. Were the surface of the earth
<div n="lb">to increase in elevation at the rate of one inch in a 1000
<div n="lb">years and the process to continue in the same proportion,
<div n="lb">the elevation would extend to 28 miles before the Antaḥ-
<div n="lb">kalpa would be concluded. Twenty Antaḥkalpas make an
<div n="lb">Asankhyakalpa. Four Asankhyakalpas make a Mahākalpa.’
