<div n="lb">an epithet of Agni, the divinity of fire). <sup>2</sup> The name of a
<div n="lb">Maharshi or a great Saint, who in the Vedas occurs especi-
<div n="lb">ally in hymns composed for the praise of Agni, Indra, the
<div n="lb">Aśvins and the Viśvadevas; and who in the epic period
<div n="lb">is considered as one of the ten Prajāpatis or lords of crea-
<div n="lb">tion engendered by Manu for the purpose of creating the
<div n="lb">universe; at a later period he appears as a mindborn son
<div n="lb">of Brahmā and as one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside
<div n="lb">over the reign of Svāyambhuva, the first, or according to
<div n="lb">others of Svārochiṣa, the second, or of Vaivaswata, the
<div n="lb">seventh Manu; he is married to Anasūyā, the daughter of
<div n="lb">Daksha and their son is Durvāsas. Produced by a flash of
<div n="lb">light from his eye which was received by Space, the via
<div n="lb">lactea personified, or according to a more recent legend,
<div n="lb">by his penitence, is Soma or the moon. See {#atrijAta,#}

<div n="lb">lation of the great bear.--An Atri, son of Sāṅkhya, but
<div n="lb">probably a different personage, is the author of a hymn in

<div n="lb">the plural of the fem., however, remaining regular, viz.
<div n="lb">{#AtreyyaH;#} but there is no necessity to adopt this artificial
