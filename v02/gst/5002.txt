{#apasPurat#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-n-ntI-t#}) The same as {#apasPura;#}
<div n="lb">{#anapasPurat#} ‘not injured, unhurt’; also as an epithet of a
<div n="lb">cow (according to {%Sāyaṇa%} on {%Ṛgv.%} 4. 42. 10., viz. {#anavahiM-#}
<div n="lb">{#sita#}). {%Mahidhara,%} however, explains the word {#apasPurat#}
<div n="lb">in the corresponding verse of the {%Vājas.%} 7. 10. ‘going to
<div n="lb">another’ i. e. running away, and {#anapasPurat#} ‘not going to
<div n="lb">another’ i. e. not running away. This latter sense being more
<div n="lb">congenial with the context, it is probably not unsafe to
<div n="lb">infer that the words {#apasPur#} and {#apasPura#} will also have to
<div n="lb">be taken in Mahīdhara's meaning of {#apasPurat,#} and {#anapa-#}
<div n="lb">{#sPur, anapasPura#} qq. vv. in Mahīdhara's meaning of {#anapa-#}
<div n="lb">{#sPurat#}.--E. {#sPur#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#Satf#}.
