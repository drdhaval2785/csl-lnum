{#apAkartos#}¦ Tatpur. (ved.) The same as {#apAkartum#} of the
<div n="lb">classical dialect, i. e. to drive away, to remove. E. The
<div n="lb">genitive of an obsolete noun {#apAkartu,#} the accus. of which
<div n="lb">is alone used, as in all similar cases, in the sense of our
<div n="lb">infinitive in the classical dialect; the native etym. expresses
<div n="lb">this thus: {#kf#} with {#A#} and {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#tosun,#} to indicate
<div n="lb">that the udātta accent is on {#apa#} i. e. on the first syllable.
