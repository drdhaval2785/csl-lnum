{#aByastamita#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) One towards whom
<div n="lb">the sun has set (scil. while he is asleep), asleep at sunset;
<div n="lb">e. g. {%Gotama:%} {#sUryAByudito brahmacArI tizWedaharaBuYjano'Bya-#}
<div n="lb">{#stamitaSca rAtriM japansAvitrIm#} (where the ellipsis ‘when
<div n="lb">asleep’ follows from the word {#svapna#} in the preceeding pas-
<div n="lb">sage: {#retaskandane Baye roge svapne'gnInDanaBEkzacaraRAni sapta-#}
<div n="lb">{#rAtraM kftvAjyahomaH sABisanDervA retasyAByAm#}).--This is the
<div n="lb">reading acc. to both Calc. edd. of {%Kullūka%} to {%Manu%} 2. 220;
<div n="lb">the Calc. ed. of {%Gotama'%}s {%Sanh.%} (made by {%Bhavanīcharana-%}
<div n="lb">{%vandya,%} as he says, {#bahuprayatnataH#}) has, however, {#sUryAByudite#}
<div n="lb">{#…(a)Byastamite ca…,#} when it would be necessary to
<div n="lb">take {#sU°#} as equivalent to {#sUryAByudaya#} and {#aBya°#} as expressing
<div n="lb">the sense of {#aByastamaya,#} both words being then locatives
<div n="lb">of a neuter {#°tam#}. But {%Kullūka'%}s reading seems better as
<div n="lb">being countenanced by analogous expressions in {%Manu%} 2. 221.
<div n="lb">Comp. {#aBinirmukta#} and {#aByudita#}. E. {#aBi#} and {#astamita#} (not
<div n="lb">{#aByastam#} and {#ita,#} for {#aBi#} refers to the person or act con-
<div n="lb">cerned by the sunset; similarly in ved. passages which
<div n="lb">contain the combination {#aByastamagAt#} or {#aByastamiyAt,#} the
<div n="lb">rad. {#gA#} or {#i#} are combined first with {#astam#} and then with
<div n="lb">{#aBi,#} not with {#aByastam#}); see also the preceding.
