{#anudAtta#}¦ Tatpur. (In Grammar.) 1. m. f. n. ({#-ttaH-ttA-ttam#})
<div n="lb">Not elevated, not being pronounced with the accent called
<div n="lb">{#udAtta#} (q. v.) or {#svarita#} (q. v.) (as the syllable of a word).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-ttaH#}) The not elevated accent, the accent (see
<div n="lb">{#svara#} and {#vAhyaprayatna#}) which is neither {#udAtta#} (q. v.) nor
<div n="lb">{#svarita#} (q. v.) and which by the depression of the voice, it
<div n="lb">requires, prepares, as it were, for the greater effort in the
<div n="lb">pronunciation of the syllables accented with the {#udAtta#} or
<div n="lb">{#svarita#}. This depression being the greatest when the syl-
<div n="lb">lable having the {#anudAtta#} accent, is immediately followed
<div n="lb">by a syllable accented with the {#udAtta#} or {#svarita,#} the {#anu-#}
<div n="lb">{#dAtta#} is called in this case {#anudAttatara#} ‘a very anudātta’.
<div n="lb">The mode of marking the {#anudAtta,#} is restricted, as is also
<div n="lb">the case with the other two accents, to the vaidik Sanhitās
<div n="lb">(Sanhitā-Pāṭhas) and Brāhmaṇas, and varies according to
<div n="lb">the different Vedas. In the Sanhitā, Pada and the Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb">of the Ṛgveda, in the Sanhitā and Pada of the Yajur- and
<div n="lb">Sanhitā of the Atharvaveda the Anudātta is marked with a
<div n="lb">horizontal line under the syllable so accented ({%thus becoming%}
<div n="lb">{%comparable also in graphic value to the sign of the Virāma, the%}
<div n="lb">{%horizontal line representing as it were the repose in accentua-%}
<div n="lb">{%tion%}); in the Brāhmaṇas of the White Yajurveda, it is not
<div n="lb">marked at all; and in the Sanhitā of the Sāmaveda the anu-
<div n="lb">dātta syllable when anudāttatara before an udātta, or before
<div n="lb">a svarita syllable bearing the figures {#2#} or {#3,#} is marked with
<div n="lb">the figure {#3#} over it, except when it is preceded in the be-
<div n="lb">ginning of a verse by other anudātta syllables, in which
<div n="lb">case only the first anudātta syllable bears the figure {#3,#}
<div n="lb">while the following anudātta syllables are left unmarked.
<div n="lb">If the anudāttatara is followed by a svarita syllable bearing
<div n="lb">the sign {#2ra,#} the syllable so accented is marked with {#3ka#}.
<div n="lb">In the Pada-text of the Sāmaveda the sign {#3#} denotes the
<div n="lb">anudāttatara before an udātta, if the latter occupies the
<div n="lb">second syllable from the beginning, or the syllable before
<div n="lb">an anudāttatara, if the latter is followed by a svarita, or
<div n="lb">lastly the anudātta accentuation of a syllable so marked and
<div n="lb">of all the syllables following it until an udātta or svarita
<div n="lb">syllable comes; the sign {#3ka#} or {#ka#} denotes the anudāttatara
<div n="lb">immediately followed by a svarita. Compare also the terms
<div n="lb">{#nIca, nihata, nyasta, nyastatara, niyata, niGAta, nyAsa, niyama#}
<div n="lb">and the radd. {#han#} with {#ni#} and {#yam#} with {#ni#}.--In the native
[Page090-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">lists of radicals, the Dhātupāthas, certain radicals have the
<div n="lb">anudātta accent as an {#it#} (q. v.) or {#anubanDa#} (q. v.) connected
<div n="lb">with them i. e. as a technical sign for certain rules they are
<div n="lb">subject to with respect to derivation &c. See also {#anu-#}
