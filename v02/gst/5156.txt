{#apAsarat#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-n-ntI-t#}) Going away; e. g.
<div n="lb">with the intention of defrauding, absconding: {#miTyAvadanpa-#}
<div n="lb">{#rImARaM SulkasTAnAdapAsaran . dApyastvazwaguRaM yaSca savyAjakraya-#}
<div n="lb">{#vikrayI,#} (in which verse of {%Yājnav.,%} 2. 262., the Calc. 8<sup>vo</sup> ed.
<div n="lb">of the {%Vyavahāra%} section of the {%Mitākṣara%} has omitted to
<div n="lb">correct the misprint {#apAsarat#} although it is corrected in
<div n="lb">the 4<sup>to</sup> edition; the {%Vivādachint.%} (p. 81, 1. 18), however, reads
<div n="lb">in this verse {#apAkraman#} instead of {#apAsaran,#} which word
<div n="lb">would correspond in its strangeness with the quotation of
<div n="lb">the same work (p. 81, 1. 21) from {%Viṣṇu:%} {#SulkasTAnamanA-#}
<div n="lb">{#kraman;#} but as the Calc. edition of {%Viṣṇu'%}s {%Sanhitā%} (fol. 3 {%a,%}
<div n="lb">1. 6) reads {#SulkasTAnamapakrAman,#} it is more likely that {#apA-#}
<div n="lb">{#kraman;#} and {#anAkraman#} are blunders of the editor than ar-
<div n="lb">chaisms of Yājnavalkya and Viṣṇu. The E. I. H. Mss. of
<div n="lb">the {%Mit.%} read {#apAsaran#}). E. {#sf#} with {#apa,#} the final vowel
<div n="lb">of the prefix being lengthened, or perhaps {#sf#} with {#A#} and
<div n="lb">{#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#Satf#}.
