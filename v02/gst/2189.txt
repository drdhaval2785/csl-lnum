{#anagnizvAtta#}¦ Tatpur. m. pl. ({#-ttAH#}) The name of a particular
<div n="lb">class of Pitṛs or Manes. This word is explained by a
<div n="lb">commentator of the Yajurveda: ‘not tasted by ({#svAtta#}) i. e.
<div n="lb">not burnt by fire, not having received the obsequies in con-
<div n="lb">formity with the religious rites’ and it appears therefore as
<div n="lb">a synonyme of {#anagnidagDa,#} as well as the converse of {#agni-#}
<div n="lb">{#zvAtta#} which, according to the same commentator, would
<div n="lb">be a synonyme of {#agnidagDa#}. Anagniṣvātta does not occur
<div n="lb">in the list of the Pitṛs which are given in the law books
<div n="lb">and in the Purāṇas, while {#agnidagDa#} and {#agnizvAtta#} (qq. vv.)
<div n="lb">are named there as distinct classes and explained in a
<div n="lb">different manner. The etymology given, which identifies
<div n="lb">{#svAtta#} and {#svAdita,#} seems moreover objectionable. E. {#a#}
<div n="lb">and {#agnizvAtta#}.
