<div n="lb">dvatī, the daughter of Rukmin; his wife is Uṣā, the
<div n="lb">daughter of Vāna, or, according to others, Subhadrā, the
<div n="lb">granddaughter of Rukmin, and his son Vajra.--The

<div n="lb">translation being founded on the word {#cara,#} given as one
<div n="lb">of the meanings of {#anirudDa,#} but without any further in-
<div n="lb">dication as to the gender. From the place, however, {#cara#}
<div n="lb">occupies in the explanation of some of the native dictio-
<div n="lb">naries, the meaning ‘spy’ is likely to be preferable to the
<div n="lb">meaning ‘moveable’.)
