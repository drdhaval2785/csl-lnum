<div n="lb">to be found together, the injunctions of the latter not be-
<div n="lb">ing applicable to those of the former. A ceremonial, for
<div n="lb">instance, taught in an anārabhyādhīta, would not be con-
<div n="lb">sidered as the essential part of another ceremonial, treated
<div n="lb">in passages, called ārabhyādhīta, which may precede or
<div n="lb">follow it, nor share in the general rules concerning these;
<div n="lb">and it is, therefore, always the object of special rules which
<div n="lb">define its position amongst the other parts of the ritual and
<div n="lb">its applicability. E. {#a#} neg. and {#AraByADIta#}.
