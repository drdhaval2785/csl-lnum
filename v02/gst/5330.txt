{#aptu#}¦ m. ({#-ptuH#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Soma. <sup>2</sup> A sacrificial animal. <sup>3</sup> Body.
<div n="lb"><sup>4</sup> A desired object, or object of desire (perhaps more cor-
<div n="lb">rectly: attainment, scil. of a desired object). <sup>5</sup> Possessing,
<div n="lb">comprising. [The two first meanings are two various inter-
<div n="lb">pretations of the word in {%Vājas.%} 5. 35. or {%Śatap.%} III. 6. 3. 8.:
<div n="lb">{#juzARo apturAjyasya vetu#} (quoted also by the {%Kāśikā%} on {%Pāṇ.%}
<div n="lb">VI. 1. 118.), viz. {%Śayaṇa:%} {#aptuH sUkzmarUpaH somaH,#} or {%Mahīdh.:%}
<div n="lb">{#aptuScAtra somaH . Apnoti pItaH saYCarIram#} i. e. ‘Soma, be-
<div n="lb">cause it comes into the body’; and {%Nṛsinha%} in the {%Swara-%}
<div n="lb">{%mañjarī:%} {#apturyajYiyaH paSuH#} (probably as connected with
<div n="lb">{#aptas#}); the third meaning is that given by {%-Bhaṭṭojid.%} on
<div n="lb">the {%Uṇ. Sūtra%} 1. 74. (perhaps because body is pervaded by
<div n="lb">Soma); the fourth meaning results from {%Bhaṭṭoj.'%}s {%Prauḍham.%}
<div n="lb">but belongs apparently to the word only in {#aptoryAma#} q. v.
<div n="lb">where it would have also the fifth meaning, according to a
<div n="lb">passage from the Śatap. quoted s. v. {#aptoryAma;#} in either
<div n="lb">of the last two meanings {#aptoH#} represents probably the
<div n="lb">{%abl.%} of the abstract noun in {#-tu#} which in the Vedas often
<div n="lb">assumes the function of our infinitive, expressed in the
<div n="lb">classical idiom by the accus. {#-tum, aptos#} being thus equal
<div n="lb">in value to the classical {#Aptum#}.] E. {#Ap#} with shortened
<div n="lb">{#A#} (accord. to the native etym., but more correctly {#ap,#}
<div n="lb">comp. the etym. of {#apta#}), uṇ. aff. {#tu#}.
