{#aBivyAdAna#}¦ Bahuvr. n. ({#-nam#}) (In vaidik Grammar.) A sup-
<div n="lb">pressed sound; viz. such a long vowel {#A,#} separated from
<div n="lb">a preceding {#A#} by a hiatus, as becomes {%wrongly%} absorbed
<div n="lb">by the protracting beyond the legitimate measure of such a
<div n="lb">preceding {#A;#} as if in the pronunciation of {#tA ApaH, avasA#}
<div n="lb">{#A, yA ApaH, tA A#} (in verses of the Ṛgveda), the
<div n="lb">speaker commits the fault of allowing the final {#A#} of {#tA,#}
<div n="lb">{#avasA, yA#} to absorb, by unduly protracting it, the be-
<div n="lb">ginning {#A#} of {#ApaH#} and {#A#}. [In the {%Ṛk-Prātiś.-Sūtra%}
<div n="lb">{#aBivyAdAnaM ca vivfttipUrve kaRWye tA Apo'vasA eti#}
<div n="lb">{#dIrGe#} it would seem more natural to look upon {#aBivyAdAna#}
<div n="lb">as a Tatpur. and render it ‘absorption’; but as {#vyAdAna#}
<div n="lb">means ‘enouncing, pronouncing’ and as a negative value
<div n="lb">of {#aBi#} is but seldom admissible in a {%Tatpur.,%} it appears
<div n="lb">better to adopt {%Uvaṭa'%}s comment which represents the
<div n="lb">word as a {%Bahuvr.%} and supplies {#akzara,#} viz.: {#AdAnamAramBaH .#}
<div n="lb">{#viviDaM vipulaM viSAlaM vAdAnamaTavAdAnameva vyAdAnam . kena-#}
<div n="lb">{#cidaBivyAptamaBiBUtaM vA vyAdAnaM tasya tadidamaBivyAdAnaM Bava-#}
<div n="lb">{#tyakzaram;#} and since the condition of {%this%} defect of pronun-
<div n="lb">ciation is the meeting of {%two%} {#A,#} there seems equally no
<div n="lb">choice left but to adopt the elliptical interpretation of this
<div n="lb">comm., as regards {#vivfttipUrve kaRWye dIrGe,#} which words he
<div n="lb">renders as neuters in the dual accus., for in giving them
<div n="lb">the apparently more natural value of a locat. sing. the rule
<div n="lb">would not necessarily imply the meeting of {%two%} long vowels
<div n="lb">{#A#}.] E. {#aBi#} and {#vyAdAna,#} scil. {#akzara#}.
