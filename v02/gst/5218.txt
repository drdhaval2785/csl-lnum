{#aputra#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-traH#}) One who is not a son. E. {#a#}
<div n="lb">neg. and {#putra#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. f. ({#-traH-trA#}) Sonless; one who has either
<div n="lb">had no son or lost his (her) son or sons ({#aputro'jAtaputro mfta-#}
<div n="lb">{#putro vA#}) and is legally held to adopt one ({%Atri:%} {#aputreREva#}
<div n="lb">{#kartavyaH putrapratiniDiH sadA . piRqodakakriyAhetoryasmAttasmA-#}
<div n="lb">{#tprayatnataH#}). {%Manu%} uses the term also impliedly of a man
<div n="lb">who has no son by a woman of the three first classes,
<div n="lb">although he may have a son by a Śūdrā woman, as re-
<div n="lb">sults from this verse: {#yadyapi syAttu satputro yadyaputro'pi vA#}
<div n="lb">{#Bavet . nADikaM daSamAddadyAcCUdrAputrAya DarmataH#} (and {%Vṛ-%}
<div n="lb">{%haspati%} employs in a similar manner the term {#anapatya,#} viz.
<div n="lb">{#anapatyasya SuSrUzurguRavAYCUdrayonijaH . laBetAjIvanaM SezaM sapi-#}
<div n="lb">{#RqAH samavApnuyuH#}); when {%Jīmūtavāhana%} moreover observes
<div n="lb">that the son of a Śūdrā in this verse applies to the legiti-
<div n="lb">mate son, the Pāraśava (q. v.) being the son of a Brāhmana
<div n="lb">by a Śūdrā not wedded to him ({#yaccAha manuH . yaM brAhmaRastu#}
<div n="lb">{#SUdrAyAM#} &c. {%Manu%} 9. 178. {#. tadapariRItaSUdrAsutABiprAyam;#}
<div n="lb">contrary to {%Kullūka%} who defines him as {#pariRItAyAmeva#}
<div n="lb">{#SUdrAyAM brAhmaRaH kAmAdyaM putraM janayet#} &c.).--A wife who
<div n="lb">has no son must be approached for the sake of getting one
<div n="lb">by her brother-in-law or by one of her relatives of the
<div n="lb">Sapiṇḍa class.--Although {%Likhita%} places a man who has
<div n="lb">no son in the same category with an impious man, a usurer
[Page196-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">and a Śūdra, when he inflicts a fast of three days on any
<div n="lb">one who eats the food of such a person ({#BuktvA vArDuzika-#}
<div n="lb">{#syAnnamavratasyAsutasya ca . SUdrasya ca taTA BuktvA trirAtraM syAda-#}
<div n="lb">{#Bojanam#}), the present edition of {%Pāṇini%} gives {#aputra#} in a
<div n="lb">{%Gaṇa%} (to VIII. 1. 67.) as a {%honorific%} term when it is the first
<div n="lb">part of a {%Karmadh.%} (the latter part of such a compound
<div n="lb">being anudātta); but on the other hand, as {#aputra#} is one of
<div n="lb">the thirty-four nativities from the knowledge of which
<div n="lb">{%Śākyamuni%} derives a special name (comp. {#catustriMSajjAta-#}
<div n="lb">{#kajYa#}), it would seem that the word in this sense belongs
<div n="lb">rather to the Buddhistic than to the Brāhmanic literature;
<div n="lb">compare e. g. the Pāli word aputtakaseṭṭhī, in {%Fansböll'%}s
<div n="lb">{%Dhammapadam%} p. 415. The {%Kāśikā%} does not mention {#aputra#}
<div n="lb">in the {%Gaṇa%} alluded to. E. {#a#} priv. and {#putra#}.
