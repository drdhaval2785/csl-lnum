{#aByavahArya#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-ryaH-ryA-ryam#}) Fit to be taken
<div n="lb">as food (solid or liquid); e. g. {%Vārtt.%} 1. to {%Pāṇ.%} VII. 3. 69.:
<div n="lb">{#BojyamaByavahAryamiti vaktavyam,#} with which words {%Kātyāyana%}
<div n="lb">criticizes {%Pāṇini%} for having either restricted the sense of
<div n="lb">{#Bojya#} to that of {#Bakzya#} (‘fit to serve as solid food’) or used
<div n="lb">{#Bakzya#} in the general acceptation of {#aByavahArya#}. {%Patanjali,%} it
[Page311-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">is true, defends {%Pāṇini%} (as he frequently sides with {%Pāṇini%}
<div n="lb">against the hypercriticisms of {%Kātyāyana%}) also on this oc-
<div n="lb">casion by alleging {#abBakza#} and {#vAyuBakza#} in evidence that {#Bakz#}
<div n="lb">(and, impliedly, that {#Bakzya#}) are used in a general sense;
<div n="lb">but on another occasion when he shows that there are
<div n="lb">words the bearing of which in the classical language can
<div n="lb">merely be established from the context in which they occur
<div n="lb">in the vaidik literature, and not be made out otherwise (see
<div n="lb">{#ekapada#}), he gives these very instances as a proof of his
<div n="lb">latter assertion, and admitting therefore that they belong to
<div n="lb">this exceptional category, corroborates thus involuntarily
<div n="lb">the view of {%Kātyāy.%} that {#Bakz#} cannot be applied to the word
<div n="lb">{#ap#} in a {%general sense,%} and much less to any other word
<div n="lb">having the sense of a liquid substance ({%Patanj. Introd.:%}
<div n="lb">{#aTavA santyekapadAnyapyavaDAraRAni tadyaTA . abBakzo vAyuBakza#}

<div n="lb">applied to {#ap,#} in the vaidik language, and as it seems
<div n="lb">strange that {%Pāṇini%} should have erred in the use of so
<div n="lb">common words as {#Bojya#} or {#Bakzya,#} it is possible also to ob-
<div n="lb">tain another result from this discussion of {%Patanjali,%} which
<div n="lb">would reconcile the observations he makes in his Introd.,
<div n="lb">with those he has appended to the quoted Sūtra, a result
<div n="lb">supported by many {%Sūtras%} of {%Pāṇini,%} viz. that {%Kātyāyana,%}
<div n="lb">far from being a contemporary of {%Pāṇini,%} as is stated in
<div n="lb">one of the ghost stories of the {%Kathāsaritsāgara,%} has lived,
<div n="lb">on the contrary, at another period, and that many {%Vārttikas%}
<div n="lb">of his must not be looked upon {%by us%} as impugning the ac-
<div n="lb">curacy of {%Pāṇini'%}s rules at the time when this grammarian
<div n="lb">wrote, but as commenting upon, extending and restricting
<div n="lb">the validity of these rules at a probably much later period
<div n="lb">of the Sanskṛt literature. See my Preface to the {%Mānava-%}
