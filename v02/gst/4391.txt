<div n="lb">Hemachandra {#‘akzasya paScAdanvakzam’#}. The second meaning
<div n="lb">would arise according to Vijnān. from rendering the word
<div n="lb">‘{#yAvaddarSanam,#} as far as a glance’. But it is more probable
<div n="lb">to consider {#anvakza#} as a deriv. from {#ac#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#ksa#}.
