{#anvADeya#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-yam#}) (In Law.) An item of a married
<div n="lb">woman's property; see {#strIDana#}. It is defined by {%Kātyāyana%}
<div n="lb">as property ‘which is received by a woman, after marriage,
<div n="lb">from the family of her husband or from her own relatives’
<div n="lb">(i. e. from her maternal uncle &c., according to Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb">or from the relatives of her parents, as the author of
<div n="lb">the Dāyabhāga interprets the latter word). [{#kAtyAyanaH .#}

<div n="lb">{#tfkulAt#}.--The reading in the printed edd. of the second

<div n="lb">fore require {#pitf#} to be taken in the sense of {#‘pitaraH#} parents’
<div n="lb">not in that of ‘father’; but the given reading seems pre-
<div n="lb">ferable as it occurs in several Mss. (E. I. H.) of this work,
<div n="lb">in Kullūka on Manu 9. 195 (with the v. 1. {#banDukule taTA#}), in two
<div n="lb">passages of the Dāyabhāga (pp. 116 and 149) with the com-
<div n="lb">ment quoted, and in the Dāyakramas. p. 17, where the comm.
<div n="lb">is: {#banDukulAdityatra banDupadena mAtApitrorupalakzaRam#}. In the
<div n="lb">Vivādachintāmaṇi p. 139 the latter half of the verse reads
<div n="lb">thus: {#anvADeyaM tu tatproktaM yallabDaM svakulAttaTA#}.] {%Bhṛgu%} defines
<div n="lb">this property as ‘whatever is received with pleasure by a
<div n="lb">woman, after the marriage ceremony, from her husband and
<div n="lb">her parents’ [{#UrDvaM labDaM tu yatkiMcitsaMskArAtprItitaH striyA .#}

<div n="lb">this passage supply after ‘her husband’: ‘and from those re-
<div n="lb">lated to her through her husband, i. e. father-in-law &c.’ and
<div n="lb">after ‘her parents’: ‘and from those related to her through
<div n="lb">her parents, i. e. grandparents &c.’, so as to effectuate a con-
<div n="lb">cordance between Kātyāyana and Bhṛgu. [Dāyabh. {#mAtA-#}
