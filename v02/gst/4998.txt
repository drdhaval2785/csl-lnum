{#apaspfc#}¦ (?) Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-k-k-k#}) (ved.) (Perhaps.) Yield-
<div n="lb">ing, giving; in the {%Ātharvav.%} 13. 1. 27: {#vi mimIzvava payasva-#}
<div n="lb">{#tIM GftAcIM devAnAM DenuranapaspfgezA#} ‘make her to have milk
<div n="lb">and to become possessed of butter for the gods: this cow
<div n="lb">does not yield any’. E. {#spfc (= pfc)#} with {#apa,#} or {#pfc#}
<div n="lb">with {#apa,#} āgāma {#suw,#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#}. [This interpretation
<div n="lb">is hypothetical, in want of a comm. to the Atharv. The
<div n="lb">same meaning might result in deriving {#apaspfk#} from {#apaspfS#}
<div n="lb">‘sprinkling, shedding’, the radicals {#pfc#} and {#spfS#} being
<div n="lb">connected in origin; but the former seems more natural.]
