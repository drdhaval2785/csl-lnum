1. {%Devarāja%}¦ (No. 5, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>Fleet fills up the lacuna<sup>30</sup> and takes Devarāja to be the
<div n="lb"/>name of an officer of Candragupta II.<sup>31</sup> But D.C. Sircar
<div n="lb"/>takes it as another name of Candragupta II.<sup>32</sup> The view
<div n="lb"/>of Sircar is more plausible and has been generally accepted by
<div n="lb"/>scholars.<sup>33</sup> It may, however, be noted that in Vākāṭaka grants
<div n="lb"/>Devagupta is mentioned as another name of a Candragupta II.<sup>34</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally the name means ‘a king of gods’ which is also
<div n="lb"/>another name of Indra.
