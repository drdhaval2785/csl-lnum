5. {%Matṛviṣṇu:%}¦ (No. 18, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>He was the installer of the stone pillar at Eraṇ, a mahārāja,
<div n="lb"/>grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu. We also find his name in
<div n="lb"/>the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa
<div n="lb"/>(A.D. 500-515).<sup>20</sup> Mātṛ stands for one of the seven Mātṛ-
<div n="lb"/>kās<sup>21</sup> and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The
<div n="lb"/>name is formed by the similar process of the combination of
<div n="lb"/>the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a
<div n="lb"/>short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant
<div n="lb"/>to the context.
