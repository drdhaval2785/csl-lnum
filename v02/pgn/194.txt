1. {%Rājyanāga%}¦ (No. 43, L. 10):
<div n="lb"/>{%Rājya%} means ‘kingly, princely or royal’; it also means ‘king-
<div n="lb"/>dom, country or realm’.<sup>31</sup> {%Nāga%} means serpent. So the whole
<div n="lb"/>literally means ‘a royal nāga’. Nāga is prefixed as well as suffixed
<div n="lb"/>to names. It shows a trend towards serpent worship. The
<div n="lb"/>use of {%Rājya%} as the first part of the name is also not without
<div n="lb"/>parallels.<sup>32</sup>
