7. {%Palāśinī<sup>40</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>This river Palāśinī issues from the mountain Raivataka. On
<div n="lb"/>account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing
<div n="lb"/>the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Palāśinī
<div n="lb"/>is described as emanating from the mountain Ūrjayat (i. e. the
<div n="lb"/>same as Raivataka).<sup>41</sup> We find another Palāśinī, (mod. Parās),
<div n="lb"/>a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.<sup>42</sup> It seems that the
<div n="lb"/>river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that
<div n="lb"/>grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have
<div n="lb"/>given it the name of Palāśinī.<sup>43</sup>
