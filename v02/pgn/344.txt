1. {%Gayā%}¦ (No. 21, L. 7):
<div n="P"/>A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya
<div n="lb"/>was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta.<sup>75</sup> Gayā is at present headquarters of the
<div n="lb"/>Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the
<div n="lb"/>modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the
<div n="lb"/>ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.<sup>76</sup> Much has been
<div n="lb"/>written on Gayā,<sup>77</sup> all of which is not possible to discuss
<div n="lb"/>here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā
<div n="lb"/>and the importance of Gayā.
<div n="P"/>In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a com-
<div n="lb"/>poser of hymns.<sup>78</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>79</sup> Gaya appears to be a
[Page-215+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who
<div n="lb"/>later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.<sup>80</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the Vāyu Purāṇa,<sup>81</sup> the city was named Gaya after an Asura,
<div n="lb"/>Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but
<div n="lb"/>granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred.
<div n="lb"/>According to R.L. Mitra,<sup>82</sup> this story is an allegorical repre-
<div n="lb"/>sentation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which
<div n="lb"/>was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in ex-
<div n="lb"/>plaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’<sup>83</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in the Nirukta<sup>84</sup> holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed
<div n="lb"/>on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata
<div n="lb"/>(III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by
<div n="lb"/>Gaya<sup>85</sup> references to which<sup>86</sup> are also found in the Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa,<sup>87</sup> Bhāgavata Purāṇa<sup>88</sup> Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,<sup>89</sup> Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa,<sup>90</sup> Viṣṇu Purāṇa,<sup>91</sup> Vāmana Purāṇa,<sup>92</sup> etc. Aśvaghoṣa's
<div n="lb"/>Buddhacarita<sup>93</sup> (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's
<div n="lb"/>visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’,
<div n="lb"/>who was later conceived as a great giant.<sup>94</sup>
<div n="P"/>We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing
<div n="lb"/>in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have
<div n="lb"/>only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get
<div n="lb"/>numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.<sup>95</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>these records are of not much use for the history of the town,
<div n="lb"/>they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>it was under the Pālas.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city played no major role in polities at any period of
<div n="lb"/>history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of
<div n="lb"/>Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.<sup>97</sup> Gayā which was the
<div n="lb"/>headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between
<div n="lb"/>the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a
<div n="lb"/>thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.<sup>98</sup>
<div n="P"/>The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata,<sup>99</sup> Rāmāyaṇa<sup>100</sup> and Purāṇas.<sup>101</sup> The Gayā has a
<div n="lb"/>special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha cere-
<div n="lb"/>mony.<sup>102</sup>
