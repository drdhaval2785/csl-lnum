3. {%Maṇṭarāja%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>King of Kurūḷa, one of the rulers of Dakṣṇāpatha defeated
<div n="lb"/>by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>In this name the first part is Maṇṭa and the second is Rāja.
<div n="lb"/>The meaning of the first part is not clear. It is clearly not a
[Page-044+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit word. As Woolner has pointed out words with cereb-
<div n="lb"/>rals are often non-Āryan or influenced by non-Āryan elements.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Another possibility is that these names show dialectal elements.
<div n="lb"/>Even now-a-days we give names like Maṇṭu, Baṇṭu, etc., to
<div n="lb"/>little children. There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got
<div n="lb"/>changed to ‘maṇṭa’ through a process of Prakritization, or
<div n="lb"/>we may derive it from an artificial root ‘maṇṭ’ to act as
<div n="lb"/>intermediator.<sup>36</sup>
