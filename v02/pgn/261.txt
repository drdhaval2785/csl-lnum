2. {%Kurama(ā)ravyabhaṭṭa%}¦ (No. 39, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned as a teacher of Chandoga ({%Veda%}), with the
<div n="lb"/>{%gotras%} Aśva and Vājin. {%Kuramā%} means bad (or misused) wealth
<div n="lb"/>and {%‘ravya’%} means ‘famous’; bhaṭṭa is a surname added to the
<div n="lb"/>names of scholarly brāhmaṇas. So the whole expression may
<div n="lb"/>mean ‘a teacher who is known for the ill use of his wealth’.
<div n="lb"/>Though such queer names are actually in practice it is not un-
<div n="lb"/>likely that in the present case it is the nick-name which has
<div n="lb"/>been mentioned.
