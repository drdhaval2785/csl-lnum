1. {%Ghaṭotkacagupta:%}¦ (No. 45, L. 1; No. 30, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkacagupta of No. 30 is identical with that of No. 45.
<div n="P"/>A distinction must be made between Ghaṭotkacagupta and
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca, the latter being the grandfather of Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>Unfortunately the word expressing the exact relationship bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween Kumāragupta (the ruling emperor) and Ghaṭotkacagupta
<div n="lb"/>(the provincial governor) is lost in the missing portion of the
<div n="lb"/>inscription. He was probably a son or younger brother of
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta I<sup>107</sup> and may have been one of the claimants for
<div n="lb"/>the throne after the death of Kumāragupta I. Altekar consi-
<div n="lb"/>ders him to be a brother of Kumāragupta.<sup>108</sup>
