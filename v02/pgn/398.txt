<div n="lb"/>In lines 18-19 we get the reading ‘Guṇekāgrahāragrāma while
<div n="lb"/>in line 21 the reading is Guṇikāgrahāragrāma. The two names
<div n="lb"/>are identical and are the same as modern Gunaighar, 18 miles
<div n="lb"/>to the north-west of Comilla, Tippera district — Bengal, in East
<div n="lb"/>Pakistan<sup>418</sup> (now Bangla Desh).
<div n="P"/>Sen considers it to have been a village-name ending with
<div n="lb"/>the term agrahāra and suggests that from the standpoint of
<div n="lb"/>administration this division was more important and better
<div n="lb"/>developed than an ordinary grāma. The expression grāmāgra-
<div n="lb"/>hāra<sup>419</sup> or agrahāragrāma refers to ‘a process of unification
<div n="lb"/>which some of the more fortunate villages underwent through
<div n="lb"/>pressure of administrative and economic necessities.<sup>420</sup>
<div n="P"/>Agrahāra (Prakrit aggāhāra) was a village,<sup>421</sup> or consisted of
<div n="lb"/>fields which were given to brāhmaṇas.<sup>422</sup> The agrahāras en-
<div n="lb"/>joyed exemption from several taxes and had other administra-
<div n="lb"/>tive immunities.
