2. {%Devakī%}¦ (No. 13, L. 13):
<div n="lb"/>The reference comes in the passage which describes how
<div n="lb"/>Skandagupta returned victorious to his mother just as Lord
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa went to Devakī after killing his enemy. <sup>5</sup> Sewell suggests
<div n="lb"/>that the name of Skandagupta's mother was Devakī and he
<div n="lb"/>has been followed by some other scholars. According to D.C.
<div n="lb"/>Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle
<div n="lb"/>of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his
<div n="lb"/>rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his
<div n="lb"/>father, had to experience difficulties for sometime. <sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Devakī is a patronymic formed by adding {%‘ī’%} suffix to
<div n="lb"/>Devaka, literally meaning ‘divine, celestial’, who was her
<div n="lb"/>father.<sup>7</sup> She was the wife of Vasudeva and the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa.<sup>8</sup>
