2. {%Davāka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states subdued by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. According to Fleet it was the ancient name of
<div n="lb"/>Dacca.<sup>533</sup> V.A. Smith takes it as corresponding to Bogra,
<div n="lb"/>Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts.<sup>531</sup> But as these districts were
<div n="lb"/>not actually incorporated in the Gupta dominions, D.R.
<div n="lb"/>Bhandarkar suggests that Ḍavāka corresponds to the hill-tract of
<div n="lb"/>Chittagong and Tippera.<sup>535</sup> K. L. Barua identifieds it with Kopili
<div n="lb"/>valley in Assam.<sup>536</sup> Generally Ḍavāka is identified with modern
<div n="lb"/>Daboka in Nowgong district, Assam.<sup>537</sup> It thus corresponds to
<div n="lb"/>the valley of the Kapili and the Yamuna rivers in Nawgong
<div n="lb"/>district where we still find a place called Doboka.<sup>538</sup>
