2. {%Vainyagupta:%}¦ (No. 51, L. 5; No. 52, L. 1):
[Page-028+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pṛthu’.<sup>109</sup> Hiranand
<div n="lb"/>Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of
<div n="lb"/>wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn {%Vainya%} was another
<div n="lb"/>name of {%Vajra%} whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Bālāditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary
<div n="lb"/>where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with
<div n="lb"/>Indra; {%Vajra%} is the thunderbolt and {%Vainya%} is a patronymic
<div n="lb"/>from Vena who is Indra.<sup>110</sup> But the suggested identification is
<div n="lb"/>extremely far-fetched. {%Vajra%} cannot by any stretch of imagina-
<div n="lb"/>tion be described as a synonym of {%Vainya.%} Moreover, it is diffi-
<div n="lb"/>cult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the
<div n="lb"/>king by such a name in preference of the real name.
<div n="P"/>In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a {%paramabhāgavata%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%mahārājādhirāja,%} but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee
<div n="lb"/>of Lord Śiva ({%bhagavān mahādevapādānudhyāta%}) and a {%mahārāja%}
<div n="lb"/>only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to
<div n="lb"/>disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of
<div n="lb"/>the argument that the Guptas were Vaiṣṇavas while Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta professed to be a Śaiva.<sup>111</sup> We find both the epithets
<div n="lb"/>{%‘paramabhāgavata’%} and {%‘mahādevapādānudhyāta’%} for him in our
<div n="lb"/>records.
<div n="P"/>It is interesting that even his Pādadāsa and Uparika are
<div n="lb"/>styled as mahārājas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Mahārāja, there-
<div n="lb"/>fore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant
<div n="lb"/>prince.<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles
<div n="lb"/>in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial
<div n="lb"/>Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called {%paramabhāgavata.%}
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta
<div n="lb"/>dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems
<div n="lb"/>to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and
<div n="lb"/>Bihar<sup>113</sup> almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not
<div n="lb"/>know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with
<div n="lb"/>Budhagupta and Bhānugupta of the Eraṇ Inscription of A.D.
<div n="lb"/>510.<sup>114</sup> Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before
<div n="lb"/>Bhānugupta (A.D. 510).<sup>115</sup>
<div n="P"/>The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable
<div n="lb"/>decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The
[Page-029+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharmāditya, Gopa-
<div n="lb"/>candra and Samācāradeva in Central and South-West Bengal
<div n="lb"/>in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to
<div n="lb"/>the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the
<div n="lb"/>bhukti (province) of Puṇḍravardhana (North Bengal).<sup>116</sup>
