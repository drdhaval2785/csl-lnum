1. {%Prabhākara%}¦ (No. 32, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>He is described as a king (bhūmipati) and a destroyer of the
<div n="lb"/>enemies of the Gupta dynasty. He was the overlord of Datta-
<div n="lb"/>bhaṭa. He is not known from any other source. The name of his
<div n="lb"/>capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the con-
<div n="lb"/>temporary local chief of Daśapura and a feudatory ally of the
<div n="lb"/>Guptas in their struggle against the Hūṇas.<sup>9</sup> Dattabhaṭa does
<div n="lb"/>not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is
<div n="lb"/>possible that Prabhākara was a self-made man who did not
<div n="lb"/>have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have
<div n="lb"/>been appointed as a ruler of Daśapura by the paramount
<div n="lb"/>power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.<sup>10</sup> That
<div n="lb"/>Prabhākara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also
<div n="lb"/>appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known
<div n="lb"/>members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.<sup>11</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>name violates the laws of Gṛhyasūtras which forbid the direct
<div n="lb"/>imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings.
