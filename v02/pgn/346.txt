3. {%Koṭivarṣa%}¦ (No. 34, L. 3; No. 35, L. 3; No. 36, L. 3; No. 37, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti.
<div n="lb"/>This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was small-
<div n="lb"/>er than that of a bhukti. The viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa occurs frequ-
<div n="lb"/>ently in the epigraphic records of the Pālas and Senas.<sup>107</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur
<div n="lb"/>district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also
<div n="lb"/>the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.<sup>108</sup> Its head-quarters was
<div n="lb"/>Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).<sup>109</sup> Yādavaprakāśa identifies
<div n="lb"/>Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.<sup>110</sup> The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a
<div n="lb"/>city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Lāṭa country.<sup>112</sup> The name is known to the Jain
<div n="lb"/>Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.<sup>113</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hemacandra<sup>114</sup> says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa,
<div n="lb"/>Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama<sup>115</sup> agrees
<div n="lb"/>with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions
<div n="lb"/>Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by
<div n="lb"/>Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the exten-
<div n="lb"/>sive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been
<div n="lb"/>the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythi-
<div n="lb"/>cal king Bāṇa.<sup>116</sup> Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihi-
<div n="lb"/>kota in the A-In-i-Akbarī) was a mahal under the Sarkar of
<div n="lb"/>Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).<sup>117</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division
<div n="lb"/>of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.<sup>118</sup> From the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, Kiṃpuruṣa-
<div n="lb"/>Varṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.<sup>119</sup> Varṣam in Pāṇini<sup>120</sup> means the
<div n="lb"/>rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tains. So originally the divisions might have been made accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important
<div n="lb"/>for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area through-
<div n="lb"/>out the year. Later on the semantic development of the word
<div n="lb"/>came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regard-
<div n="lb"/>ed to be important and hence they had often been used to
[Page-217+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>denote the year.<sup>121</sup>
