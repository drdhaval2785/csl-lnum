 {%Grāma:%}¦
<div n="P"/>It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.<sup>383</sup> It seems
<div n="lb"/>that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabi-
<div n="lb"/>tants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was
<div n="lb"/>transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a
<div n="lb"/>village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently
<div n="lb"/>from the Ṛgveda<sup>384</sup> onwards, appears to have been in the sense
<div n="lb"/>of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which
<div n="lb"/>were scattered over the country, some close together, some far
<div n="lb"/>apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>385</sup> In the early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya)
<div n="lb"/>in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the
<div n="lb"/>forest.<sup>386</sup> The villages were probably open, though perhaps a
<div n="lb"/>fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.<sup>387</sup> Presumably they
<div n="lb"/>consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details
<div n="lb"/>are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahā-
<div n="lb"/>grāmāḥ) were known.<sup>388</sup> The grāma may, however, perhaps
<div n="lb"/>be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several fami-
<div n="lb"/>lies, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
<div n="lb"/>(viś), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>389</sup> The head of the
<div n="lb"/>village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The
<div n="lb"/>king's share in a village is referred to as early as the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or
<div n="lb"/>city.<sup>391</sup> Kheṭa was the half of a city and the village was the
[Page-240+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>half of a kheṭa.<sup>392</sup> Cities other than the capital are called
<div n="lb"/>Karvaṭa, a little less is Nigama and lesser is grāma and still
<div n="lb"/>lesser is a house.<sup>393</sup>
<div n="P"/>Grāma is changed into gaon,<sup>394</sup> as Suvarṇagrāma, Sonār-
<div n="lb"/>gaon; Kalahagrāma, Kahalgaon.
<div n="P"/>Following are the place-name with this suffix. We have also
<div n="lb"/>included here some place-names which are villages though they
<div n="lb"/>have not been termed as such with this suffix.
