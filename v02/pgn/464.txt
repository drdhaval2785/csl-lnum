1. {%Āryāvartta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 12):
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many
<div n="lb"/>kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta,
<div n="lb"/>Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin
<div n="lb"/>and Balavarman.<sup>677</sup> We also find references to Āryāvarta in
<div n="lb"/>other epigraphic records.<sup>678</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Āryāvarta<sup>679</sup> means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or
<div n="lb"/>excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant.
<div n="P"/>It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive
<div n="lb"/>the word Ārya from the root §{%Ar,%} to plough, and suggest that
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the
<div n="lb"/>pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.<sup>680</sup>
<div n="P"/>“If {%Ārya%} were purely a racial term. a more probable deri-
<div n="lb"/>vation would be {%Ar,%} meaning strength or valour, from §ar
<div n="lb"/>to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares,
<div n="lb"/>areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying,
<div n="lb"/>like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and
<div n="lb"/>then moral force and elevation”.<sup>681</sup> “Intrinsically, in its most
<div n="lb"/>fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or
<div n="lb"/>overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all
<div n="lb"/>outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human
<div n="lb"/>advance.”<sup>682</sup> Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations
<div n="lb"/>of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country
<div n="lb"/>to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sans-
<div n="lb"/>krit Āryāvarta.<sup>683</sup>
<div n="P"/>In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word
<div n="lb"/>Ārya and explain it to mean {%śiṣṭa.%} Patañjali also in his Mahā-
[Page-264+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>bhāṣya first explains the meaning of {%śiṣṭa%} in order to draw
<div n="lb"/>attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He
<div n="lb"/>remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then
<div n="lb"/>mentions its boundaries.<sup>684</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and ci-
<div n="lb"/>vilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be
<div n="lb"/>treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>and Yamunā.<sup>685</sup> In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>686</sup> special honour
<div n="lb"/>is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the
<div n="lb"/>hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.<sup>687</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Patañjali,<sup>688</sup> Āryāvarta was bounded on the
<div n="lb"/>north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the
<div n="lb"/>west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal
<div n="lb"/>hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.<sup>689</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and
<div n="lb"/>denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions
<div n="lb"/>were the basis of social order.<sup>690</sup>
<div n="P"/>What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as
<div n="lb"/>Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of
<div n="lb"/>Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Ārya-
<div n="lb"/>nism.<sup>691</sup> Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in
<div n="lb"/>the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and
<div n="lb"/>Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.<sup>692</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of
<div n="lb"/>standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time
<div n="lb"/>of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the
<div n="lb"/>Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the
<div n="lb"/>norm.<sup>693</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was
<div n="lb"/>popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the
<div n="lb"/>Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and
<div n="lb"/>south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.<sup>694</sup> This is
<div n="lb"/>supported by the Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara.<sup>695</sup> Rājaśek-
<div n="lb"/>hara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between
<div n="lb"/>Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.<sup>696</sup> In Inscription No. 1, L. 29
<div n="lb"/>Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern
<div n="lb"/>region’.<sup>697</sup> The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by
[Page-265+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi<sup>698</sup> and the Rājataraṅ-
<div n="lb"/>giṇī.<sup>699</sup>
