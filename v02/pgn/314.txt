1. {%Ābhīra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may
<div n="lb"/>also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which
<div n="lb"/>may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the north-
<div n="lb"/>western Deccan.<sup>21</sup> D.C. Sircar<sup>22</sup> describes Ābhīra in singular as
<div n="lb"/>a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be
<div n="lb"/>traced in the present Ahīras,<sup>23</sup> who in tribal groups, abound
<div n="lb"/>largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions
<div n="lb"/>of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people,
<div n="lb"/>mostly cowherds and agriculturists.<sup>24</sup> This tribe<sup>25</sup> is thought to
<div n="lb"/>have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa Govinda<sup>26</sup> in his pastoral aspect.
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>27</sup> places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan
<div n="lb"/>‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’.
<div n="P"/>In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in
<div n="lb"/>the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar,
<div n="lb"/>as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of
<div n="lb"/>Ptolemy.<sup>28</sup> The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra
<div n="lb"/>generals served in the armies of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western
<div n="lb"/>India in the second century A.D. as is known from their
<div n="lb"/>inscriptions.<sup>29</sup> They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya
<div n="lb"/>of Patañjali<sup>30</sup> in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of
<div n="lb"/>Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout
<div n="lb"/>the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in
<div n="lb"/>northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.<sup>31</sup> Vātsyāyana<sup>32</sup> refers to
<div n="lb"/>the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>33</sup>
[Page-126+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>34</sup> refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’
<div n="lb"/>or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>35</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani
<div n="lb"/>(Saturn).
<div n="P"/>The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṃvat 918, records that the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours,
<div n="lb"/>because of their violent demeanour.<sup>36</sup> The Ābhīra robbers are
<div n="lb"/>also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.<sup>37</sup> Epigraphic evidence
<div n="lb"/>indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th
<div n="lb"/>Century in Khandesh.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,<sup>39</sup> it is stated that
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī,
<div n="lb"/>either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṃśa in the Kāvya<sup>40</sup> on
<div n="lb"/>the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics
<div n="lb"/>passed into Apabhraṃśa as a result of the activities of the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.<sup>41</sup> We know from the Amarakośa<sup>42</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of
<div n="lb"/>a cowherd’.
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa<sup>43</sup> mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṃkhya,
<div n="lb"/>Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that
<div n="lb"/>the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīrapallī.<sup>44</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get
<div n="lb"/>the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.<sup>45</sup>
<div n="lb"/>These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt
<div n="lb"/>to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early
<div n="lb"/>date.<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattacharya<sup>47</sup> describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd
<div n="lb"/>caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in
<div n="lb"/>India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>foreigners in the Purāṇas.<sup>48</sup> Their kings were regarded as
<div n="lb"/>vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).<sup>49</sup> In the Mahābhārata the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras are called Mleccha.<sup>50</sup> According to Manu<sup>51</sup> they were
<div n="lb"/>the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the
<div n="lb"/>Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava
<div n="lb"/>kṣatriyas.<sup>52</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>53</sup> places the Ābhīras in the
[Page-127+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Southern quarter of India.
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>54</sup> considers them to be an admixture possibly of
<div n="lb"/>white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a
<div n="lb"/>a very dark colour and concludes that they were western
<div n="lb"/>Ānavas.<sup>55</sup>
