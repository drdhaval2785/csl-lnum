3. {%Uttara Kuru%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>A person named Śaṃkara is described in the inscription as
<div n="lb"/>born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which
<div n="lb"/>resembles (in beatitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.<sup>710</sup>
[Page-266+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern.
<div n="lb"/>Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed
<div n="lb"/>to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Himālaya
<div n="lb"/>mountains, and is described as a country of everlasting hap-
<div n="lb"/>piness.<sup>711</sup> We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the
<div n="lb"/>section on tribes. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>712</sup> mentions it as a country
<div n="lb"/>situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had
<div n="lb"/>only a mythical or legendary existence.
