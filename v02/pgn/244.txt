1. {%Ādityabandhu%}¦ (No. 52, L. 20):
<div n="lb"/>The first part is Āditya meaning ‘the deity Sun,; {%bandhu%} means
<div n="lb"/>‘a relation or friend’. So the whole means ‘a friend of god Sun’.
<div n="lb"/>We have many examples of names with {%bandhu%} as the second
<div n="lb"/>part, e.g. Dīnabandhu, Viśvabandhu, Vedabandhu, etc. We
<div n="lb"/>have also names with Āditya as their first part such as Āditya-
<div n="lb"/>nātha and Ādityanārāyaṇa.
