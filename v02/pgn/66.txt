2. {%Hariṣeṇa%}¦ (No. 1, L. 32):
<div n="lb"/>He is given several titles indicating offices held of a {%Khādya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṭapākika,<sup>58</sup>%} a {%Sāndhivigrahika,%} a {%Kumārāmātya%} and a {%Mahāda-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṇḍanāyaka%} of Samudragupta. He is also the composer of this
<div n="lb"/>inscription which has been termed as a {%kāvya.<sup>59</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Hari is Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa and {%sena%} is to be obtained from
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit senā. The name can be explained in two ways.
<div n="lb"/>That Hari is his personal name and ṣeṇa or sena his surname.
<div n="lb"/>We may also explain it is, ‘one with Hari as his army’. The
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata informs us that there was only big army on the side
<div n="lb"/>of the Kauarvas and there was only Hari, i.e., Lord Kṛṣṇa on
<div n="lb"/>the side of the Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas could get Hari on
<div n="lb"/>their side by foregoing the Yādava army to the Kauravas.
