<div n="lb"/>Nagara means a town, a city.<sup>335</sup> we find the term being
<div n="lb"/>used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).<sup>336</sup> The word Nāgaraka (or
<div n="lb"/>Nāgarika)<sup>337</sup> also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for
<div n="lb"/>‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted
<div n="lb"/>for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times
<div n="lb"/>nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living
<div n="lb"/>in city or village’.
<div n="P"/>In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the
<div n="lb"/>derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it
<div n="lb"/>appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11,
<div n="lb"/>18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish
<div n="lb"/>Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but
<div n="lb"/>is excluded from the Janapada.<sup>339</sup> Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra
<div n="lb"/>uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.<sup>340</sup> It is significant that
<div n="lb"/>the word Nagara is of late occurrence.<sup>341</sup> It is likely
<div n="lb"/>that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have
<div n="lb"/>developed much. In the Epic,<sup>342</sup> there are references to
<div n="lb"/>Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined
<div n="lb"/>to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Saṃhitās
<div n="lb"/>and Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="P"/>The word Nagara is changed into:<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Nar as Kuśīnagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar
<div n="P"/>(b) Ner as Jīrṇanagara, Jooner.
<div n="P"/>In modern times the suffix nagara is sometimes used to
<div n="lb"/>denote an inhabitation or Mohalla e. g. Tilak Nagar, Subhash
<div n="lb"/>Nagar, Patel Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Lajapat Nagar.
<div n="P"/>We do not find any place-name with the suffix ‘nagara’ in
<div n="lb"/>our records but with a little change in the same sense with the
<div n="lb"/>suffix nagarī, which is given below:
