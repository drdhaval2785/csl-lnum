(9) {%Piṣṭapura%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>It has been mentioned as one of the southern regions which
<div n="lb"/>were first captured and then liberated by Samudragupta.<sup>320</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Piṣṭapura is the same
<div n="lb"/>as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king
<div n="lb"/>Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also
<div n="lb"/>refers to Piṣṭapura.<sup>321</sup> Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the
<div n="lb"/>Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.<sup>322</sup> It was the
<div n="lb"/>capital of Kaliṅga.<sup>323</sup> ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued
<div n="lb"/>a grant<sup>324</sup> from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant
<div n="lb"/>records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled
<div n="lb"/>over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.<sup>325</sup> In our
<div n="lb"/>inscription Devarāṣṭra<sup>326</sup> has been treated separately. It seems
<div n="lb"/>that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavar-
<div n="lb"/>man they were amalgamated.
<div n="P"/>Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbour-
<div n="lb"/>ing regions.<sup>327</sup> Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga.<sup>328</sup> Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his
<div n="lb"/>capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and
<div n="lb"/>placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been
<div n="lb"/>another name given to him on account of the extension of
<div n="lb"/>his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.<sup>329</sup> It is interesting
<div n="lb"/>to note that Kālidāsa<sup>330</sup> refers to Raghu defeating a king
<div n="lb"/>named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign.
<div n="lb"/>It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri.
<div n="lb"/>After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in
<div n="lb"/>the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.<sup>331</sup>
<div n="P"/>At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kunti-
<div n="lb"/>mādhava.<sup>332</sup> We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī,
<div n="lb"/>a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions
<div n="lb"/>of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa
<div n="lb"/>during the Gupta period.<sup>333</sup> This must be a local form of some
<div n="lb"/>popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.<sup>334</sup>
