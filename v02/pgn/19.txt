2. {%Dattadevī%}¦ (No. 4, L. 10; No. 10, L. 5; No. 12, L. 20;
<div n="lb"/>No. 13, L. 4; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 49, L. 3;
<div n="lb"/>No. 50, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>She is mentioned as the wife of Samudragupta and the mother
<div n="lb"/>of Candragupta II. {%Datta%} means ‘given’ or protected.<sup>119</sup> We
<div n="lb"/>also find {%‘Datta’%} as the name-ending suffix for male names in
<div n="lb"/>literature.
<div n="P"/>3 (a) {%Dhruvadevī%} (No. 53, L. 5; No. 12, L. 21; No. 13, L. 5;
<div n="lb"/>No. 49, L. 4; No. 50, L. 4; No. 47, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>She was the mother of Kumāragupta I and the wife of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta II. Literally {%‘Dhruva’%} means unchangeable or constant.
<div n="lb"/>It is also the name of the polar star (personified as son of
<div n="lb"/>Uttāna-pāda and grandson of Manu).<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>3 (b). {%Dhruvasvāminī%} (No. 42, LL. 3-4):
<div n="lb"/>We come to know of Dhruvasvāminī only in No. 42. Lines 1-3
<div n="lb"/>mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevī elsewhere
<div n="lb"/>appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two
<div n="lb"/>queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the
<div n="lb"/>two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that
<div n="lb"/>Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.
