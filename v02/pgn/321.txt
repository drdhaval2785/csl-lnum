8. {%Kotas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 14):
<div n="lb"/>The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the
<div n="lb"/>Kotas.<sup>162</sup> Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription
<div n="lb"/>with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.<sup>163</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But it is now generally believed<sup>164</sup> that ‘the episode of the
<div n="lb"/>Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early
<div n="lb"/>Gupta History’.
<div n="P"/>The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found
<div n="lb"/>in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the
<div n="lb"/>Upper Gangetic valley’.<sup>165</sup> Scholars differ in their views
<div n="lb"/>about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja
<div n="lb"/>while others with Pāṭaliputra.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of
<div n="lb"/>both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.<sup>167</sup> It must, however, be
<div n="lb"/>noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,<sup>168</sup> so the location
<div n="lb"/>of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received
<div n="lb"/>Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra
<div n="lb"/>({%Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā%}). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Hariṣeṇa
<div n="lb"/>has referred to Kānyakubja and not Pāṭaliputra’<sup>169</sup> is incorrect.
<div n="lb"/>It is only later that Kānyakubja gains the honour of being
<div n="lb"/>called Kusumapura when the glory of Pāṭaliputra had started
<div n="lb"/>declining.<sup>170</sup>
<div n="P"/>In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja
<div n="lb"/>along with the Nāga kings Acyuta and Nāgasena and with the
<div n="lb"/>support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas
<div n="lb"/>lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.
