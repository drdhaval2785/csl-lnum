 {%Eraṇḍapalla%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region
<div n="lb"/>conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet
<div n="lb"/>identifies Eraṇḍapalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh
<div n="lb"/>district of the Bombay Presidency.<sup>450</sup> K.N. Dikshit and Y.R.
<div n="lb"/>Gupte agreed with this view.<sup>451</sup> But according to Dubreuil and
<div n="lb"/>K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near
<div n="lb"/>Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.<sup>452</sup> G. Ramdas opposes
<div n="lb"/>Fleet's identification on the ground that Eraṇḍapallī mentioned
<div n="lb"/>immediately after the kingdom of Svāmidatta cannot be so far
<div n="lb"/>away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity
<div n="lb"/>of Kaliṅga and Piṣṭapura kingdom.<sup>453</sup> Eraṇḍapallī is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kaliṅga.<sup>454</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Banerjee counts Damana of Eraṇḍapalla among the three
<div n="lb"/>chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>through their country.<sup>455</sup>
<div n="P"/>G. Ramdas<sup>456</sup> regards Dubreuil's identification also to
<div n="lb"/>be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kaliṅga which was clearly
<div n="lb"/>the country ruled by Svāmidatta. Eraṇḍapallī will have, there-
<div n="lb"/>fore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda
[Page-246+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village Eṇḍapalli
<div n="lb"/>in Elore Tāluka.<sup>457</sup> But if we suppose that Svāmidatta was
<div n="lb"/>the king of Koṭṭūra alone and not of the whole of Kaliṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Eraṇḍapallī may well be identified with Chicacole.<sup>458</sup>
<div n="P"/>Palla is the corrupt form of Pallī which means an inhabitation
<div n="lb"/>and Eraṇḍa is the castor-oil-plant<sup>459</sup> It seems that the region
<div n="lb"/>abounded in eraṇḍa plants.
