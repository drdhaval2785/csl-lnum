2. {%Raivataka%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as Ūrajayat see
<div n="lb"/>Ūrjayat):
<div n="lb"/>Raivataka is also mentioned in the Ādi-Parvan of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata,<sup>84</sup> the Vividhatīrthakalpa,<sup>85</sup> the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>86</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamūda,<sup>87</sup> and the Jaunpur In-
<div n="lb"/>scription of Iśānavarman.<sup>88</sup> Its modern name Girnar was a
<div n="lb"/>switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city
<div n="lb"/>on or at the foot of a hill’.<sup>89</sup> Raivataka derives its name
<div n="lb"/>from king Revatā, the father of Revatī, (the wife of Baladeva,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's elder brother).<sup>90</sup> Revata is supposed to have come
<div n="lb"/>there from Dwārakā and lived on the hill. There is still a
<div n="lb"/>tank called Revatī-kuṇḍa near Dāmodarakuṇḍa in the gorge
<div n="lb"/>of the hill.<sup>91</sup> The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha in the Śiśu-
<div n="lb"/>pālavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the
<div n="lb"/>description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses
<div n="lb"/>1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by
<div n="lb"/>one at the mountain Raivataka.
