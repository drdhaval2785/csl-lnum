 {%Bhukti%}¦ (from §bhuj)
<div n="P"/>Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.<sup>43</sup> Bhukti
<div n="lb"/>denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern
<div n="lb"/>Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern
<div n="lb"/>India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as
<div n="lb"/>large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.<sup>44</sup> Thus
[Page-212+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti
<div n="lb"/>of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,<sup>45</sup> whereas
<div n="lb"/>under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the
<div n="lb"/>districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti
<div n="lb"/>included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.<sup>46</sup> Śrāvastibhukti
<div n="lb"/>under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern
<div n="lb"/>U.P.<sup>47</sup> The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have
<div n="lb"/>been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.<sup>48</sup> Bhukti
<div n="lb"/>is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.<sup>49</sup> The unit bhukti
<div n="lb"/>which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period
<div n="lb"/>as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently
<div n="lb"/>found in the early medieval period.<sup>50</sup> The mention of a
<div n="lb"/>Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Jīvitagupta II.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find only one place name with the suffix {%bhukti%} which
<div n="lb"/>is detailed below:
<div n="P"/>{%Puṇḍravardhana%} (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34,
<div n="lb"/>L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43,
<div n="lb"/>L. 14):
<div n="P"/>This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging
<div n="lb"/>from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443
<div n="lb"/>to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this
<div n="lb"/>period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kula-
<div n="lb"/>putra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached
<div n="lb"/>the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva
<div n="lb"/>was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍra-
<div n="lb"/>vardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed
<div n="lb"/>that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document
<div n="lb"/>in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free
<div n="lb"/>waste lands. His prayer was granted.
<div n="P"/>General Cunningham<sup>52</sup> identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the
<div n="lb"/>extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of
<div n="lb"/>the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line
<div n="lb"/>between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.<sup>53</sup> According
<div n="lb"/>to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the
<div n="lb"/>districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and
<div n="lb"/>Tirhut.<sup>54</sup> It seems to have been the biggest administrative
<div n="lb"/>division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several
<div n="lb"/>viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four<sup>55</sup> are mentioned
[Page-213+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North
<div n="lb"/>Bengal.
<div n="P"/>Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of
<div n="lb"/>the Puṇḍras.<sup>56</sup> The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in
<div n="lb"/>the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>57</sup> The earliest literary reference to
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the
<div n="lb"/>Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of
<div n="lb"/>India.<sup>58</sup> The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā,<sup>59</sup> as situated in the east.<sup>60</sup> The Kāvyamīṃāṃsā also
<div n="lb"/>mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍra-
<div n="lb"/>vardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs
<div n="lb"/>first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use
<div n="lb"/>till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved
<div n="lb"/>by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the
<div n="lb"/>12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital
<div n="lb"/>to Gauḍa in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th
<div n="lb"/>or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Puṇḍravardhana was
<div n="lb"/>occupied by the Muhammedans.<sup>62</sup>
