 {%Maṇḍala%}¦
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions
<div n="lb"/>of many dynasties of the early medieval period. Originally it
<div n="lb"/>denoted in the Arthaśāstra and other legal texts,<sup>154</sup> a diploma-
<div n="lb"/>tic circle of twelve neighbouring kings, some friendly and
<div n="lb"/>others unfriendly, in relation to a king desirous of conquest.
<div n="lb"/>The term could also be used for the territory under the posse-
<div n="lb"/>ssion of a feudatory. But in the Gupta period maṇḍala is used
<div n="lb"/>for some kind of administrative division though in early medie-
<div n="lb"/>val period its use was in feudalistic association.<sup>155</sup> In Cālukyan
<div n="lb"/>records, the governor of a maṇḍala was usually called a Maṇḍ-
<div n="lb"/>aleśvara or Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara.<sup>156</sup> In the records of the Impe-
<div n="lb"/>rial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vīthī.<sup>157</sup> Literally
<div n="lb"/>meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, coun-
<div n="lb"/>try in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bouring state.<sup>158</sup>
