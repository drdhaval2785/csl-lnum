1. {%Avamukta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="P"/>The Inscription No. 1 refers to Avamukta as one of the
<div n="lb"/>countries in Dakṣiṇāpatha subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler
<div n="lb"/>was Nīlarāja.<sup>529</sup>. Avamukta has not been identified with cer-
<div n="lb"/>tainty. Some scholars on the basis of the similarity of names
<div n="lb"/>identify it with Avimukta another name of Kāśī.<sup>530</sup> But the
<div n="lb"/>suggestion cannot be accepted. Avamukta of the inscription
<div n="lb"/>was a country in the South while Avimukta or Kāśī is an eas-
<div n="lb"/>tern country. It may be considered to be situated in the Goda-
<div n="lb"/>vari district.<sup>531</sup> According to D.B. Diskalkar it must lay on
<div n="lb"/>the Eastern Ghāṭs which lie to the west of Kāñcī or Conjee-
<div n="lb"/>varam.<sup>532</sup>
