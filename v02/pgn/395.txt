(5) {%Doṅgā-grāma%}¦ (No. 34, L. 11; No. 36. L. 6):
<div n="lb"/>In No. 34 we get a reference to ‘Doṅgā’, but in No. 36, the
<div n="lb"/>name appears as Doṅgā-grāma.
[Page-241+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Doṅgā-grāma is said to have been situated in Himavac-
<div n="lb"/>Chikhara<sup>403</sup> identified with Barāhachatra (Varāhakṣetra) in
<div n="lb"/>Nepal.<sup>404</sup> But scholars<sup>405</sup> are not right in co-relating Doṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>grāma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it.
<div n="lb"/>There is a long gap between the references to Himavac-
<div n="lb"/>Chikhara and Doṅgā-grāma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is
<div n="lb"/>associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incar-
<div n="lb"/>nation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya)
<div n="lb"/>these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma
<div n="lb"/>is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla
<div n="lb"/>for the construction of the two temples having the names of the
<div n="lb"/>two deities.<sup>406</sup> The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at
<div n="lb"/>Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘Himavac-
<div n="lb"/>Chikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin
<div n="lb"/>and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between
<div n="lb"/>the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma
<div n="lb"/>the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word
<div n="lb"/>‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper
<div n="lb"/>Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where
<div n="lb"/>a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a
<div n="lb"/>land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord
<div n="lb"/>Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the
<div n="lb"/>temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any
<div n="lb"/>confusion or distinction.<sup>407</sup> Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem
<div n="lb"/>to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village
<div n="lb"/>is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to
<div n="lb"/>the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.<sup>408</sup> But the
<div n="lb"/>village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear
<div n="lb"/>from the word Doṅgā itself.<sup>409</sup> The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local
<div n="lb"/>forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in
<div n="lb"/>No. 37 also attests to it.<sup>410</sup> The village may have consisted of a
<div n="lb"/>few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where
<div n="lb"/>the temples were situated was away from habitation.
<div n="P"/>Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district
<div n="lb"/>included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal,<sup>411</sup> which was rejected by Sircar,<sup>412</sup> seems to be
<div n="lb"/>correct.
