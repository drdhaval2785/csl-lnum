8. {%Vasumitra%}¦ (No. 36, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>The first part of the name is {%vasu%} (wealth) and the second is
<div n="lb"/>{%mitra%} the whole literally meaning ‘a friend of wealth’. Another
<div n="lb"/>possibility is that the name vasu stands for a group of deities
<div n="lb"/>and mitra means the sun and vasumitra thereby yielding the
<div n="lb"/>sense “a sun among deities”
