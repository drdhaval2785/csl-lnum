<div n="lb"/>In L. 8 Surāṣṭra is used in plural<sup>25</sup> while in L. 9 it is an adjective
<div n="lb"/>of {%avani%} (land).<sup>26</sup> In this inscription great importance has been
[Page-211+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>attached to Surāṣṭra. After his conquests, Skandagupta
<div n="lb"/>deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be
<div n="lb"/>entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Surāṣṭras.<sup>27</sup>
<div n="lb"/>At last he was satisfied by appointing Parṇadatta as a governor
<div n="lb"/>over this western<sup>28</sup> region.
<div n="P"/>Surāṣṭra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its
<div n="lb"/>Prakrit name Soraṭh.<sup>29</sup> Literally the name means a good
<div n="lb"/>country. It was so named probably on account of the natural
<div n="lb"/>fertility of the land, Soraṭh is well known for rich crops of all
<div n="lb"/>kinds, and splendid cattle.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Surāṣṭra<sup>31</sup> is mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription
<div n="lb"/>of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Puṣyagupta,
<div n="lb"/>under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tuṣāspa under
<div n="lb"/>Aśoka.<sup>32</sup> The Purāṇas<sup>33</sup> and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<sup>34</sup> mention it
<div n="lb"/>a country in the west while the Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>35</sup> mentions it
<div n="lb"/>as a country in the South. It may be due to the different
<div n="lb"/>geographical units made by the authors of the Kāvyamīmāṃsā
<div n="lb"/>and the Bṛhatsaṃhitā.
<div n="P"/>Under Gupta emperors Bāmanasthalī (modern Banthali) was
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Surāṣṭra, before Valabhī became its capital.<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The name Surāṣṭra also occurs in the Mahābhārata, the
<div n="lb"/>Jātakas<sup>37</sup>, and several times in the Rāmāyaṇa.<sup>38</sup> It is also
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.<sup>39</sup> In Kauṭilya's Arthaśās-
<div n="lb"/>tra, Surāṣṭras are mentioned as one of the corporations of
<div n="lb"/>warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.<sup>40</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the Arthaśāstra the elephants of Surāṣṭra were inferior to those
<div n="lb"/>belonging to Aṅga and Kaliṅga.<sup>41</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the medieval period,<sup>42</sup> in three directions, Bhavanagar,
<div n="lb"/>Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits
<div n="lb"/>of Surāṣṭra.
