4. {%Himaśarmman%}¦ (No. 43, L. 9):
<div n="lb"/>Hima<sup>39</sup> means snow or winter. G. Bühler<sup>40</sup> takes the mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing of {%hima%} as ‘the moon’. So we can say that the name is
<div n="lb"/>based on the deity moon. The word Śarman signifies only
<div n="lb"/>a surname. It has got no meaning as the part of the name.
<div n="lb"/>Or we may say that the name is based on the winter
<div n="lb"/>season.<sup>41</sup>
