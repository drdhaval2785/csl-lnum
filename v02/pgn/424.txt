 {%Kṣetra%}¦
<div n="P"/>Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its
<div n="lb"/>use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix
<div n="lb"/>as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in com-
<div n="lb"/>position it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it.
<div n="lb"/>For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddha-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of this word<sup>481</sup> in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the
<div n="lb"/>existence of separate fields<sup>482</sup> carefully measured off,<sup>483</sup> though
<div n="lb"/>in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating culti-
<div n="lb"/>vated land generally.<sup>484</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>485</sup> and later, the
<div n="lb"/>sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more
<div n="lb"/>general use is also found.<sup>486</sup> The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,<sup>487</sup> ‘Lord
<div n="lb"/>of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presid-
<div n="lb"/>ing over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each
<div n="lb"/>dwelling.<sup>488</sup>

<div n="P"/>Kṣetra is changed into:<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra
<div n="P"/>(b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra.
<div n="P"/>In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for
<div n="lb"/>agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.<sup>490</sup>
<div n="P"/>Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which
<div n="lb"/>means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.<sup>491</sup> ‘Kheṭa’
<div n="lb"/>meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).<sup>492</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a
<div n="lb"/>city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.<sup>493</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants
<div n="lb"/>and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).<sup>494</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lele<sup>495</sup> considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form
<div n="lb"/>of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa
<div n="lb"/>was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral
<div n="lb"/>camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka
<div n="lb"/>came to include agricultural village.<sup>496</sup>
<div n="P"/>Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscri-
<div n="lb"/>ptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the
<div n="lb"/>names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part
<div n="lb"/>of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do
<div n="lb"/>not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of
<div n="lb"/>the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubt-
<div n="lb"/>ful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being
<div n="lb"/>blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur
<div n="lb"/>in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Guṇikāgra-
<div n="lb"/>hāra,<sup>497</sup> is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the
<div n="lb"/>town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S.
<div n="lb"/>Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.<sup>498</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence
<div n="lb"/>some of the names are full of tribal vocabulary.<sup>499</sup>
