10. {%Kumāragupta II:%}¦ (No. 48, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta II was the immediate successor of Pūrugupta
<div n="lb"/>in the light of the data given in two dated inscriptions, viz. the
<div n="lb"/>Sarnath Buddha Stone Image inscriptions of Kumāragupta and
<div n="lb"/>Budhagupta. The first (No. 48) mentions A.D. 473 as the date of
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta who must, therefore, be taken as Kumāragupta II
<div n="lb"/>and the second (No. 54) mentions A.D. 476 as the date of
<div n="lb"/>Budhagupta. No. 48 records the date, Gupta year 154<sup>91</sup> when
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta was protecting the earth.<sup>92</sup> The renovation of the
<div n="lb"/>Sun temple mentioned in No 17, LL. 20-21 seems to have taken
<div n="lb"/>place in his reign.<sup>93</sup> It seems that Mookerji has by mistake,
<div n="lb"/>connected the reference<sup>94</sup> meant for Kumāragupta I with
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta II.<sup>95</sup> The temple was originally constructed in the
<div n="lb"/>reign of Kumāragupta I in M.S. 493 = A.D. 436 (L. 19).
