5. {%Hūṇa%}¦ (No. 13, L. 15):
<div n="lb"/>They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription
<div n="lb"/>of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 — 467) is
<div n="lb"/>stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By
<div n="lb"/>whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when
<div n="lb"/>he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirl-
<div n="lb"/>pool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.<sup>107</sup> The defeat
<div n="lb"/>inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly
<div n="lb"/>half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their
<div n="lb"/>depredations.<sup>108</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a
<div n="lb"/>Central Asian tribe.
<div n="P"/>Uigur<sup>109</sup> transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient
<div n="lb"/>Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’,
<div n="lb"/>the other {%‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’.%} The first part ({%xun%} — ) of the last
<div n="lb"/>form is not in doubt and neither is the {%u%} of the last part, the
<div n="lb"/>only question is about the change of the initial {%i%} of ancient
<div n="lb"/>Chinese into {%y%} in Uigur before {%u%} and in Sandhi, and about
<div n="lb"/>the pronunciation of the final consonant.<sup>110</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close
<div n="lb"/>to the {%Hunu%} as to the Sanskrit {%Hūṇa%} is very similar to the
[Page-132+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Chinese “transcription” {%Xunu%} or {%Xūnu,%} and Avesta {%Hunu,%}
<div n="lb"/>except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel {%‘u’%}
<div n="lb"/>the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that
<div n="lb"/>language. “The Purāṇas have a form {%Urṇa%} which together with
<div n="lb"/>Epic Skr. {%Hūṇa%} suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, {%Xūrnu%}”.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here the Tibetan {%Hor,%} which corresponds
<div n="lb"/>with the first syllable of the reconstructed form {%Hūr-ṇa.%} The
<div n="lb"/>difference of vowels may indicate a back diphthong or back
<div n="lb"/>vowel between {%o%} and {%u,%} as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since
<div n="lb"/>the Greeks wrote {%u (y)%} for Indic {%u.%}<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form,
<div n="lb"/>we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were
<div n="lb"/>applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns,
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have
<div n="lb"/>been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosi-
<div n="lb"/>birians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have
<div n="lb"/>been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that
<div n="lb"/>there must have been several subject people and subject armies
<div n="lb"/>in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and
<div n="lb"/>mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.<sup>113</sup> Otto
<div n="lb"/>Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the
<div n="lb"/>basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology,
<div n="lb"/>and archaeology<sup>114</sup> and has pointed out that the greater part
<div n="lb"/>of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol<sup>115</sup> Later
<div n="lb"/>Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the
<div n="lb"/>{%Hsiung%}-nu and {%Huns%} were Turks.<sup>116</sup>
<div n="P"/>Louis Bazin<sup>117</sup> and Von Gabain<sup>118</sup> also reached the conclu-
<div n="lb"/>sion that in language of the {%Hsiung-nu%} there was a high percent-
<div n="lb"/>age of Turkish words.<sup>119</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the second century B.C. the {%Hiung-nu (Huns)%} started a
<div n="lb"/>movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying
<div n="lb"/>the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence
<div n="lb"/>of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central
<div n="lb"/>Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half
<div n="lb"/>of the fourth century A.D., a branch of them, the White Huns,
<div n="lb"/>or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time
<div n="lb"/>when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of
<div n="lb"/>Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had
<div n="lb"/>begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their
[Page-133+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the
<div n="lb"/>Guptas into pieces’.<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia.
<div n="lb"/>Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a
<div n="lb"/>vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.<sup>121</sup> We know
<div n="lb"/>of a {%Hūṇa-deśa%} placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to
<div n="lb"/>the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of
<div n="lb"/>heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab
<div n="lb"/>region practically suggesting the same area.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king
<div n="lb"/>of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their
<div n="lb"/>king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.<sup>123</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription<sup>124</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.<sup>125</sup> These
<div n="lb"/>two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is
<div n="lb"/>another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab)
<div n="lb"/>referring to {%Rājādhirāja Mahārāja%} Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla),
<div n="lb"/>whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Eraṇ Inscription,<sup>126</sup> but others regard the two as quite
<div n="lb"/>different.<sup>127</sup> Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any
<div n="lb"/>reference to the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain
<div n="lb"/>work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).<sup>128</sup> Here
<div n="lb"/>Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrab-
<div n="lb"/>hāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a
<div n="lb"/>scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>taraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas
<div n="lb"/>or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal<sup>130</sup> and Fleet<sup>131</sup> held that
<div n="lb"/>Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow<sup>132</sup> holds that Tora-
<div n="lb"/>māṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed,
<div n="lb"/>and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a
<div n="lb"/>new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.<sup>133</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian
<div n="lb"/>literature. D.C. Sircar<sup>134</sup> opines that the Indian names {%Hūṇa,%}
[Page-134+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>{%Hārahūṇa%} or {%Hārahūra,%} supposed to be associated with the
<div n="lb"/>Chinese name {%Hiung-nu%} and ‘the White Hun’ of the European
<div n="lb"/>writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be
<div n="lb"/>roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the
<div n="lb"/>Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘{%ajayad-gupta%} (or Japto or
<div n="lb"/>Jarto) {%Hūṇān%}’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to
<div n="lb"/>express an event which occurred within the life-time of the
<div n="lb"/>author.<sup>135</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman<sup>136</sup> a reference
<div n="lb"/>is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named.
<div n="lb"/>The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed coun-
<div n="lb"/>tries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas
<div n="lb"/>could subdue.<sup>137</sup>
<div n="P"/>The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier
<div n="lb"/>bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was
<div n="lb"/>pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm
<div n="lb"/>of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.<sup>138</sup>
<div n="P"/>With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place
<div n="lb"/>not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the
<div n="lb"/>early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.<sup>139</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was
<div n="lb"/>probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily over-
<div n="lb"/>whelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirak-
<div n="lb"/>ula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend
<div n="lb"/>his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was
<div n="lb"/>forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihira-
<div n="lb"/>kula but finally triumphed over his rival.<sup>140</sup>
<div n="P"/>The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed
<div n="lb"/>the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to
<div n="lb"/>be even a disturbing element in Indian History.<sup>141</sup> The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras,
<div n="lb"/>Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.<sup>142</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating
<div n="lb"/>the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus<sup>143</sup>, the (pale)
<div n="lb"/>faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands
<div n="lb"/>(who died in the battle).<sup>144</sup>
<div n="P"/>Varāhamihira<sup>145</sup> mentions them under the jurisdiction of
<div n="lb"/>Ketu and places them in the North.<sup>146</sup> Dr. Upendra Thakur<sup>147</sup>
[Page-135+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost
<div n="lb"/>lost their original name of {%Hiong-nou%} or {%Huns.%} Later the powerful
<div n="lb"/>Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they
<div n="lb"/>were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards
<div n="lb"/>they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the
<div n="lb"/>powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the {%Hiong-nou%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%Huns%} received different names in different periods beginning
<div n="lb"/>with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In
<div n="lb"/>spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts
<div n="lb"/>of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their
<div n="lb"/>exact origin and ethnic affinities.
<div n="P"/>We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their
<div n="lb"/>merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols
<div n="lb"/>but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa
<div n="lb"/>(a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in
<div n="lb"/>the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-Malwa-
<div n="lb"/>Gujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced
<div n="lb"/>by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and
<div n="lb"/>also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings
<div n="lb"/>of Bengal<sup>148</sup>
