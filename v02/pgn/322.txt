9. {%Kurus%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and
<div n="lb"/>the Southern.<sup>171</sup> We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.<sup>172</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of
<div n="lb"/>the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.<sup>173</sup> In the earliest literature the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But
[Page-137+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus)<sup>174</sup> and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.<sup>175</sup> The Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>176</sup> refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his
<div n="lb"/>son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>177</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Oldenberg<sup>178</sup> seems to be right in suggesting that the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes
<div n="lb"/>referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’
<div n="lb"/>who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is
<div n="lb"/>likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as
<div n="lb"/>enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru people.<sup>179</sup> Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas
<div n="lb"/>occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found.
<div n="lb"/>Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda<sup>180</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later
<div n="lb"/>Kurukshetra.<sup>181</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with Pāñcālas.<sup>182</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).<sup>183</sup>
<div n="lb"/>A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.<sup>184</sup> It appears from a
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the
<div n="lb"/>Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>185</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was
<div n="lb"/>developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it
<div n="lb"/>spread thence east, south and west. <sup>186</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic
<div n="lb"/>and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>187</sup> where they are located beyond the Himalayas
<div n="lb"/>(pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,<sup>188</sup> however, the
<div n="lb"/>country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya
<div n="lb"/>to be a land of the gods ({%deva-kṣetra%}), but Jānṃtapi
<div n="lb"/>Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly
<div n="lb"/>mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the
[Page-138+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kuruk-
<div n="lb"/>shetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir
<div n="lb"/>might naturally be found.<sup>189</sup> In Buddhist literature, Uttara-
<div n="lb"/>Kuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are
<div n="lb"/>some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory
<div n="lb"/>of a country that once had a historical existence.<sup>190</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical
<div n="lb"/>constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are
<div n="lb"/>told by Kauṭilya<sup>191</sup> that the Kurus were {%‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,%}
<div n="lb"/>or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank
<div n="lb"/>and rights.<sup>192</sup>
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>193</sup> shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably non-
<div n="lb"/>Āryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern
<div n="lb"/>Kurus were Muṇḍic.<sup>194</sup>
