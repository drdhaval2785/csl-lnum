8. {%Kurāla%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Dakṣiṇāpatha
<div n="lb"/>subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Maṇṭarāja. Fleet
<div n="lb"/>suggests that Kaurālaka is a mistake for Kairalaka, denoting
<div n="lb"/>the well known province Kerala in the South of India.<sup>613</sup>
<div n="lb"/>D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>614</sup> identifies this Kerala with the Sonpur
[Page-259+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>territory in C.P. round about Yayātinagara where the author
<div n="lb"/>of the Pavanadūta locates the Keralas. Barnett identified it
<div n="lb"/>with modern village Korāḍa in South India.<sup>615</sup> Kurāḷa is
<div n="lb"/>taken by Kielhorn<sup>616</sup> to be the same as Kunāla mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin II<sup>617</sup> and identified with
<div n="lb"/>the Kolleru lake between the Godavari and the Krishna.<sup>618</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>619</sup> objects to this view on the ground
<div n="lb"/>that the Kolleru lake must have been included in the kingdom
<div n="lb"/>of Veṅgī mentioned later on<sup>620</sup> in the same list in the inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion. G. Ramdas<sup>621</sup> seems to be right when he observes that
<div n="lb"/>Kurāḷa must be the plain country of the Ganjam district to
<div n="lb"/>the north-east of the Mahendra hill now chiefly occupied by
<div n="lb"/>the Oriyas.
