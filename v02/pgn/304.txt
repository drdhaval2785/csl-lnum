<div n="lb"/>son of Bāhu. He is said to have been called Sa-gara, as born
<div n="lb"/>together with a poison administered to his mother by the co-
<div n="lb"/>wives of her husband. He was father of Asamañjasa by Keśinī
<div n="lb"/>and of sixty thousand sons by Sumati; the latter were turned
<div n="lb"/>into a heap of ashes by the sage Kapila, and their funeral
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies could only be performed by the waters of Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>to be brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying their
<div n="lb"/>remains; this was finally accomplished by Bhagīratha.<sup>73</sup>
