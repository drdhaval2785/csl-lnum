6. {%Vaivya<sup>152</sup>%}¦ (No. 40, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>In this inscription the viṣaya of Vaivya is mentioned. The word
<div n="lb"/>Vaivya is inexplicable. We may, however, suggest that the term
<div n="lb"/>was possibly derived from Prakrit Vevva<sup>153</sup> which means ‘fear’
<div n="lb"/>and hence Vaivya would mean ‘fearful’ or ‘dreadful’.
