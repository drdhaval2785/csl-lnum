(3) {%Daśapura%}¦ (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silk-
<div n="lb"/>weavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to
<div n="lb"/>the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by
<div n="lb"/>the virtues of its kings.<sup>234</sup> The inscription refers itself to the
<div n="lb"/>reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Viśvavarman<sup>235</sup> was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of
<div n="lb"/>the inscription records that it was under the governorship of
<div n="lb"/>Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)<sup>236</sup>, that a lofty
<div n="lb"/>temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of
<div n="lb"/>silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.<sup>237</sup> Afterwards, under other
<div n="lb"/>kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was
<div n="lb"/>restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era
<div n="lb"/>(= A.D. 473).<sup>238</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western
<div n="lb"/>Malwa<sup>239</sup> formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura
<div n="lb"/>stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of
<div n="lb"/>the river Śiprā.<sup>240</sup> We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor
<div n="lb"/>Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D.
<div n="lb"/>490-500).<sup>241</sup> Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava
<div n="lb"/>or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.<sup>242</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā<sup>243</sup> and the Meghadūta<sup>244</sup> of Kālidāsa.
<div n="P"/>The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early
<div n="lb"/>Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,<sup>245</sup> and in one inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Vikram Saṃvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.<sup>246</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor.
<div n="lb"/>The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of
[Page-227+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the
<div n="lb"/>city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet
<div n="lb"/>points out that even now, the township includes some twelve
<div n="lb"/>to fifteen outlying hamlets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā,
<div n="lb"/>Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was
<div n="lb"/>originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such ham-
<div n="lb"/>lets (pura)’.<sup>247</sup> This view of Fleet is more appealing.
<div n="P"/>Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which
<div n="lb"/>it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also
<div n="lb"/>explained in two ways:
<div n="P"/>As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent
<div n="lb"/>Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referr-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which,
<div n="lb"/>even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do
<div n="lb"/>not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some
<div n="lb"/>paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.<sup>248</sup>
<div n="P"/>F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two
<div n="lb"/>names of Mad and Daśapura: the former<sup>249</sup> being the name of
<div n="lb"/>a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of
<div n="lb"/>Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined
<div n="lb"/>Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction
<div n="lb"/>of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.<sup>250</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations,
<div n="lb"/>but the second seems to be more reasonable.
