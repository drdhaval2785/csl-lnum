<div n="lb"/>right arm by the sages to save him from falling into hell
<div n="lb"/>and is considered the ninth incarnation of Hari. He was the
<div n="lb"/>first king who introduced agriculture. Due to scarcity of
<div n="lb"/>supply when people complained of hunger, he armed his
<div n="lb"/>arrow and the earth was milked. Hilly tracts were levelled
<div n="lb"/>and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were organised
<div n="lb"/>for the first time. Pṛthu has been panegyrised by the Gandhar-
