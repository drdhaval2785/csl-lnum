5. {%Narmadā%}¦ (No. 18, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Mahārāja
<div n="lb"/>Suraśmicandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over
<div n="lb"/>the area between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>23</sup> This is
<div n="lb"/>one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Nar-
<div n="lb"/>madā.<sup>24</sup> It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.<sup>25</sup> No ex-
<div n="lb"/>press reference to the Narmadā can be traced in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the
<div n="lb"/>reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>26</sup> We find from the Amarakośa<sup>27</sup> that Revā is
<div n="lb"/>another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the
<div n="lb"/>name of the chief was derived from his association with the
<div n="lb"/>river.<sup>28</sup> The Raghuvaṃśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital
<div n="lb"/>of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).<sup>29</sup> It has
<div n="lb"/>been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the
[Page-295+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas.<sup>30</sup> The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra
<div n="lb"/>addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from
<div n="lb"/>serpents.<sup>31</sup> The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and
<div n="lb"/>falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā
<div n="lb"/>with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.<sup>32</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan
<div n="lb"/>range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from
<div n="lb"/>the Vindhya itself.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man
<div n="lb"/>who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the
<div n="lb"/>Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.<sup>34</sup> Several rivers
<div n="lb"/>such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī<sup>35</sup> are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as falling into the Narmadā.
