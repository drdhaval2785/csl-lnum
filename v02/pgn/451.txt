7. {%Koṭṭūra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned as one of the Southern kingdoms conquered by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. Its ruler was Svāmidatta. It has been identified
<div n="lb"/>by N. Dubreuil with Kothoor in Ganjam.<sup>608</sup> Banerjee counts
<div n="lb"/>Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga
<div n="lb"/>who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Fleet Koṭṭūr (from Koṭṭapura) being a very
<div n="lb"/>common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Koṭṭūra
<div n="lb"/>of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly
<div n="lb"/>Koṭṭūr in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the
<div n="lb"/>passes in the Anaimalai Hills.<sup>610</sup> R. Sathianathaier proposes
<div n="lb"/>to identify Koṭṭūra with Koṭṭūra near Tuni (E. Godavari dis-
<div n="lb"/>trict) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through
<div n="lb"/>Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam<sup>611</sup> There is another
<div n="lb"/>Koṭṭūra in the Vizagapatam district.<sup>612</sup> But the generally
<div n="lb"/>accepted view is to identify it with Kothoor in Ganjam.
