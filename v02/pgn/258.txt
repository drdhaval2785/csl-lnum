7. {%Sthāya (na) pāla%}¦ (No. 33, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>A merchant who also acts as a scribe. D.C. Sircar takes the
<div n="lb"/>reading ‘Sthāyapāla’.<sup>99</sup> He also suggests the possibility of a
<div n="lb"/>second reading {%‘sthānapāla’%} which means ‘watchman or police-
<div n="lb"/>man’.<sup>100</sup> This reading seems to be correct; Sthāyapāla
<div n="lb"/>yields no sensible meaning.
