20. {%Śaka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion
<div n="lb"/>with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should
[Page-162+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet<sup>477</sup>
<div n="lb"/>we may better split the expression into two distinct names,
<div n="lb"/>the Śakas and Muruṇḍas.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.)
<div n="lb"/>must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the {%Satrapal%}
<div n="lb"/>family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka
<div n="lb"/>ruler was Rudrasiṃha II and his successor Rudrasiṃha III,
<div n="lb"/>whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>II.<sup>478</sup> Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and
<div n="lb"/>about Sāñcī.<sup>479</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally
<div n="lb"/>living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called
<div n="lb"/>Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that
<div n="lb"/>place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of
<div n="lb"/>Iran, and then the Greeks in India.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only
<div n="lb"/>a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas
<div n="lb"/>reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice
<div n="lb"/>of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit.
<div n="lb"/>The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80
<div n="lb"/>B.C.)<sup>481</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas
<div n="lb"/>were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invad-
<div n="lb"/>ing Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under
<div n="lb"/>the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recover-
<div n="lb"/>ed their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more
<div n="lb"/>is heard of the Kṣaharātas.<sup>482</sup>
<div n="P"/>Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but
<div n="lb"/>generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of
<div n="lb"/>Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled
<div n="lb"/>roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the height of their power govern-
<div n="lb"/>ing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of
<div n="lb"/>this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant inscription in correct Sanskrit,<sup>483</sup> a long panegyric which
<div n="lb"/>records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great
<div n="lb"/>artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excava-
<div n="lb"/>ted under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka.
<div n="lb"/>This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records
[Page-163+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 150.<sup>484</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the
<div n="lb"/>West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which
<div n="lb"/>was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at
<div n="lb"/>that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power
<div n="lb"/>to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription
<div n="lb"/>claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka
<div n="lb"/>lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with
<div n="lb"/>them’.<sup>485</sup> It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered
<div n="lb"/>to his successor,<sup>486</sup> and Candragupta II had to conquer the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas once again.
<div n="P"/>There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and
<div n="lb"/>forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonour-
<div n="lb"/>able peace.<sup>487</sup> Most authorities reject the story, and deny the
<div n="lb"/>historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper
<div n="lb"/>coins bearing his name<sup>488</sup> strengthens the suggestion that
<div n="lb"/>the tradition has a basis of fact.<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who
<div n="lb"/>finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388<sup>490</sup> So he is
<div n="lb"/>rightly remembered as {%‘Śakāri’%} ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.<sup>491</sup>
<div n="P"/>The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and
<div n="lb"/>seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during
<div n="lb"/>the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins
<div n="lb"/>as wearing trousers.<sup>492</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus
<div n="lb"/>defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.<sup>493</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of
<div n="lb"/>the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking
<div n="lb"/>spread. Strabo<sup>494</sup> speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the
<div n="lb"/>Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style
<div n="lb"/>passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.<sup>495</sup> We
<div n="lb"/>know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.<sup>496</sup> Prob-
<div n="lb"/>ably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in
<div n="lb"/>the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to
<div n="lb"/>pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink-
[Page-164+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian
<div n="lb"/>influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced
<div n="lb"/>drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.<sup>497</sup> But all
<div n="lb"/>this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a
<div n="lb"/>period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been
<div n="lb"/>great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for
<div n="lb"/>the drinking before Śakas.
<div n="P"/>We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is
<div n="lb"/>very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is
<div n="lb"/>known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact
<div n="lb"/>have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in
<div n="lb"/>the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled
<div n="lb"/>Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era
<div n="lb"/>spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East
<div n="lb"/>Asia.<sup>498</sup> Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps
<div n="lb"/>the era may have earned its present name.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came to be included in the category of the mart-
<div n="lb"/>ial classes of ancient India. Manu<sup>499</sup> refers to the warlike
<div n="lb"/>people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pah-
<div n="lb"/>lava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their
<div n="lb"/>neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more
<div n="lb"/>into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and
<div n="lb"/>performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.<sup>500</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in
<div n="lb"/>the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by
<div n="lb"/>the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra's army.<sup>501</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>502</sup> traces the Śaka invasion on the basis
<div n="lb"/>of literary and linguistic considerations.
<div n="P"/>The name of the capital of the {%Madras,%} Śākala, and that of
<div n="lb"/>the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are
<div n="lb"/>based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion.
<div n="lb"/>Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha
<div n="lb"/>belonged, enshrines a reminiscence of the word Śaka.
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the place-names ending in {%kanthā%} existing in the
[Page-165+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala
<div n="lb"/>region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long
<div n="lb"/>before the time of Pāṇini,<sup>503</sup> who is known to have flourished
<div n="lb"/>one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great.
<div n="lb"/>{%Kanthā%} is a Śaka word for city<sup>504</sup> and is akin to kadhāvara or
<div n="lb"/>kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, {%Kand%} of Persian, {%Kanthā%}
<div n="lb"/>of Khotanese, {%Kandh%} of Sogdian, {%Kandai%} of Pushto, {%Kanda%}
<div n="lb"/>or {%Koent%} of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant
<div n="lb"/>that the land beyond the Oxus, the {%Urheimat%} of the Śakas,
<div n="lb"/>abounds in {%Kanthā%}-ending place names, such as Samarkand,
<div n="lb"/>Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand.
<div n="P"/>The reference to the stepped-well, called {%Śakandhu%} after
<div n="lb"/>the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known
<div n="lb"/>as {%Karkandhu%} after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana<sup>505</sup>
<div n="lb"/>also leads to the same conclusion.
<div n="P"/>At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the
<div n="lb"/>north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka inva-
<div n="lb"/>sion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern
<div n="lb"/>extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign
<div n="lb"/>of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled
<div n="lb"/>them.<sup>506</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constitut-
<div n="lb"/>ed along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing
<div n="lb"/>of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of
<div n="lb"/>the battle. <sup>507</sup> Caraka in his medical treatise<sup>508</sup> refers to them
<div n="lb"/>in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava,
<div n="lb"/>Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.<sup>509</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas in modern times.<sup>510</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal
<div n="lb"/>to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian
<div n="lb"/>people.<sup>511</sup> The depth of their influence on Indian society is
<div n="lb"/>manifest from the word {%thakura,%} which implies the ideas of
<div n="lb"/>nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab
<div n="lb"/>and is derived from the word {%thagora, taugara%} or {%tukhara.%}<sup>512</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The name {%Tukhāra%} itself survives in the name of the {%Tokhi%}
<div n="lb"/>caste found in the North-West.<sup>513</sup> Another caste called Khosla
[Page-166+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta
<div n="lb"/>chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous
<div n="lb"/>to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa
<div n="lb"/>emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated
<div n="lb"/>this word with Turki {%güjlü%} meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow
<div n="lb"/>has compared it with Turki {%guzel,%} meaning ‘beautiful’, but
<div n="lb"/>Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of
<div n="lb"/>the Śakas.<sup>514</sup> So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this
<div n="lb"/>tribe.<sup>515</sup> Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab,
<div n="lb"/>there are caste-groups of {%Soi%} and {%Sikka,%} which are reminiscent
<div n="lb"/>of the Śakas.
