5. {%Kāśī%}¦ (No. 28, L. 6):
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the in-
<div n="lb"/>scription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples
<div n="lb"/>of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin,
<div n="lb"/>belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.<sup>578</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their
<div n="lb"/>major seat at Kāśī.
<div n="P"/>The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’.
<div n="lb"/>The Skandapurāṇa<sup>579</sup> says that the city of Kāśī became famous
<div n="lb"/>by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or
<div n="lb"/>because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines
<div n="lb"/>forth here.<sup>580</sup> B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read
<div n="lb"/>sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it
<div n="lb"/>with a certain kind of grass.<sup>581</sup> It has been known for centuries
<div n="lb"/>under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras),
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśma-
<div n="lb"/>śāna.<sup>582</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs
<div n="lb"/>in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.<sup>583</sup> Vārāṇasī
<div n="lb"/>was the capital of the people of Kāśī.<sup>584</sup> Thus it seems that
<div n="lb"/>geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the
<div n="lb"/>latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times
<div n="lb"/>the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended
<div n="lb"/>the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small
<div n="lb"/>place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference
<div n="lb"/>to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti,
<div n="lb"/>and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī
<div n="lb"/>viṣaya.<sup>585</sup> Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient
<div n="lb"/>city of the Kāśī.<sup>586</sup> The Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup>587</sup> also mentions
[Page-257+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City.
<div n="P"/>The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the
<div n="lb"/>north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The
<div n="lb"/>Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.<sup>588</sup> At the time of
<div n="lb"/>Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Kośala.<sup>589</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important
<div n="lb"/>Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in
<div n="lb"/>the time of Aśoka.<sup>590</sup> During the period of Gupta rule it was
<div n="lb"/>on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the
<div n="lb"/>mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.<sup>591</sup> The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>include the region in the Gupta empire.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in
<div n="lb"/>his Mahābhāṣya<sup>593</sup> mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.<sup>594</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kāśī has been a place of much importance for Hindu pil-
<div n="lb"/>grimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length
<div n="lb"/>in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never
<div n="lb"/>leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here
<div n="lb"/>is believed to get emancipation.<sup>595</sup>
