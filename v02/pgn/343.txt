 {%Viṣaya%}¦
<div n="lb"/>According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, king-
<div n="lb"/>dom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural
<div n="lb"/>it meant lands or possessions.<sup>63</sup> In the Aṣṭādhyāyī<sup>64</sup> it denotes
<div n="lb"/>regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba,
<div n="lb"/>the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava
<div n="lb"/>people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The
<div n="lb"/>names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic
<div n="lb"/>distribution of population over particular areas for the time
<div n="lb"/>being without reference to the form of government’.<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe<sup>66</sup> is significant.
<div n="lb"/>Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and
<div n="lb"/>Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samu-
<div n="lb"/>dāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being
<div n="lb"/>identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments
<div n="lb"/>give the impression that even such geographical units as were
[Page-214+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>not a janapada were called Viṣaya.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would
<div n="lb"/>not have treated the former under a separate heading.<sup>68</sup> A
<div n="lb"/>Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a
<div n="lb"/>Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the
<div n="lb"/>Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the
<div n="lb"/>Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,<sup>69</sup> it is landed property, the share
<div n="lb"/>of estate which was the source of livelihood.
<div n="P"/>In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada
<div n="lb"/>and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for
<div n="lb"/>example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Jana-
<div n="lb"/>padas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka
<div n="lb"/>denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya
<div n="lb"/>tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ,
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were
<div n="lb"/>only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka,
<div n="lb"/>Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the
<div n="lb"/>modern administration.<sup>71</sup> Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the
<div n="lb"/>viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division
<div n="lb"/>in many cases.<sup>72</sup> The district administration was well organised
<div n="lb"/>in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the
<div n="lb"/>seals of the district administration.<sup>73</sup> Sealings of the district
<div n="lb"/>administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at
<div n="lb"/>Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore
<div n="lb"/>the impress of their official seals.<sup>74</sup>
<div n="P"/>We have the following place-names ending in Viṣaya:
