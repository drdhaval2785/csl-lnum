1. {%Kuladāsa%}¦ (No. 43, L. 10):
[Page-072+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>{%Kula%} means ‘race, family, community’.<sup>6</sup> {%Dāsa%} means servant.
<div n="lb"/>So the whole will literally mean ‘a servant of the community or
<div n="lb"/>family’. Dharmaśāstras prescribe {%‘dāsa’%} to be used by śūdras at
<div n="lb"/>the end of their names but we do not find any strict adherence
<div n="lb"/>to this rule by the society. {%Dāsa-%} ending names show devotion.
<div n="lb"/>We have such names as ‘Kulabhūṣaṇa’ based on the word
<div n="lb"/>{%‘kula’.%}
