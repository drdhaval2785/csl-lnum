12. {%Samataṭa%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>It is one of the frontier kingdoms which offered their sub-
<div n="lb"/>mission to Samudragupta.<sup>645</sup> Sen<sup>646</sup> remarks that Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta reduced the king of Samataṭa to the rank of a subordi-
<div n="lb"/>nate prince who had to part with most of his powers and was
<div n="lb"/>‘allowed to rule over a much reduced dominion as a vassal of
<div n="lb"/>the emperor’. Retaining only the control of its internal ad-
<div n="lb"/>ministration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify
[Page-261+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>his imperious commands.<sup>647</sup> Samataṭa is the only territory in
<div n="lb"/>Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.<sup>648</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this
<div n="lb"/>inscription.<sup>649</sup> Literally the name means ‘the shore country’
<div n="lb"/>or ‘Level country’.<sup>650</sup> ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted
<div n="lb"/>a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.<sup>651</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa
<div n="lb"/>southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li-
<div n="lb"/>1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him,
<div n="lb"/>this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and
<div n="lb"/>was more than 3,000 li in circuit.<sup>652</sup> From Samataṭa, the
<div n="lb"/>pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and
<div n="lb"/>reached Tanmolihti,<sup>653</sup> or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in
<div n="lb"/>the Midnāpur district.<sup>654</sup> Samataṭa, therefore, must have been
<div n="lb"/>the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding
<div n="lb"/>to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna
<div n="lb"/>districts.<sup>655</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known from the Baghaura Inscription<sup>656</sup> that the
<div n="lb"/>Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>kalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the
<div n="lb"/>Lohitya.<sup>657</sup> The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with
<div n="lb"/>Samataṭa.<sup>658</sup>
<div n="P"/>Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa com-
<div n="lb"/>prised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.<sup>659</sup> Its
<div n="lb"/>capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12
<div n="lb"/>miles west of Comilla district.<sup>660</sup> After the rule of the Guptas,
<div n="lb"/>Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman
<div n="lb"/>and Sena dynasties.<sup>661</sup>
