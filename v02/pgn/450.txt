6. {%Kosala%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal
<div n="lb"/>sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms
<div n="lb"/>whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified
<div n="lb"/>with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur,
<div n="lb"/>Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.<sup>596</sup> Its old capital
<div n="lb"/>was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.<sup>597</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is the same as Mahā-kosala<sup>598</sup> which forms the largest unit among
<div n="lb"/>the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.<sup>599</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light
<div n="lb"/>on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between
<div n="lb"/>the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period
<div n="lb"/>several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the
<div n="lb"/>early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas
<div n="lb"/>and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by
<div n="lb"/>Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built
[Page-258+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>by the ruling chiefs<sup>600</sup> in different parts of Mahākosala.
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as
<div n="lb"/>having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.<sup>601</sup>
<div n="P"/>N.L. Dey<sup>602</sup> identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of
<div n="lb"/>Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near
<div n="lb"/>Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests
<div n="lb"/>an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is
<div n="lb"/>an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative
<div n="lb"/>prefix’<sup>603</sup> in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also,
<div n="lb"/>like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa
<div n="lb"/>Tosala.<sup>604</sup> Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name
<div n="lb"/>of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa
<div n="lb"/>kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.<sup>605</sup> But it is clear
<div n="lb"/>from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate
<div n="lb"/>entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.<sup>606</sup> The Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mīmāṃṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.<sup>607</sup>
