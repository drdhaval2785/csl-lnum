 {%Rāṣṭra<sup>1</sup>%}¦ (from §rāj):
<div n="P"/>It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and later Saṃhitās,<sup>3</sup> it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’.
<div n="lb"/>It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)<sup>4</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>refers to a country.<sup>5</sup> It was the name of a Commissioner's
<div n="lb"/>division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.<sup>6</sup> In South India, under the
<div n="lb"/>Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only
<div n="lb"/>a district, if not a tehsil.<sup>7</sup> The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra<sup>8</sup> says
<div n="lb"/>that ‘all the rāṣṭra including {%nagara%} is called {%deśa%} or {%maṇḍala%}
<div n="lb"/>while nagara is excluded in janapada’.
<div n="P"/>It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds: —
<div n="P"/>(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages,
<div n="lb"/>but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty
<div n="lb"/>four villages make a big rāṣṭra.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and
<div n="lb"/>eighty four villages.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>(iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and
<div n="lb"/>forty eight villages.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>It further discusses that seven cities should be established
<div n="lb"/>in each rāṣṭra.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā
<div n="P"/>(b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ
<div n="P"/>It also changes into raṭṭa,
<div n="P"/>Cf. Nāgiraṭṭa. Walde also derives it
<div n="lb"/>from §rāj-(n. sg. rāṭ)

<div n="P"/>In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries,
<div n="lb"/>we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different
<div n="lb"/>territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms
<div n="lb"/>flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small
<div n="lb"/>kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Vākāṭakas and
<div n="lb"/>Gāhaḍavālas we usually find reference to only one territorial
<div n="lb"/>division, the district variously called {%viṣaya%} or {%rāṣṭra.<sup>15</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Following are the names with this ending:
