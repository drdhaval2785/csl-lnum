3. {%Sumeru%}¦ (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15):
<div n="lb"/>In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the
<div n="lb"/>breasts of the earth (the other being Kailāśa) and the Gupta
[Page-299+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>king Kumāragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In
<div n="lb"/>No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhūdhara. Its other names
<div n="lb"/>are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcanagiri.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal,
<div n="lb"/>where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.<sup>93</sup>
<div n="lb"/>According to the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>94</sup> the Sumeru Parvata is
<div n="lb"/>bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrāśvavarṣa.<sup>95</sup> It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Kālikāpurāṇa.<sup>97</sup> According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw
<div n="lb"/>the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu
<div n="lb"/>river flows from this mountain.<sup>98</sup> We also find the mention of
<div n="lb"/>the Meru in the Śiśupālavadha of Māgha. It was on account
<div n="lb"/>of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for
<div n="lb"/>praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.<sup>99</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with
<div n="lb"/>four Mahādvīpas as its four petals and mount Meru as its
<div n="lb"/>pericarp.<sup>100</sup>
