11. {%Pratyanta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in Inscription No. 1 that the kings of frontier
<div n="lb"/>(or border) states ‘Samataṭa, Ḍavāka, Kāmarūpa, Nepāla and
<div n="lb"/>Kartṛpura’ gratified the imperious commands of Samudrgupta,
<div n="lb"/>by giving all (kinds of) taxes and obeying (his) orders and
<div n="lb"/>coming to perform obeisance.<sup>639</sup> We also find a reference to
<div n="lb"/>Pratyanta in the Girnar Rock Edict No. 2. of Aśoka.<sup>640</sup>
<div n="P"/>Law<sup>641</sup> contrasts between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. He
<div n="lb"/>takes Pratyanta to mean the Mleccha country and quotes the
<div n="lb"/>Amarakośa, Divyāvadāna, Abhidhānacintāmaṇi and Smṛti-
<div n="lb"/>candrikā.<sup>642</sup> But in the inscription<sup>643</sup> the contrast is between
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣināpatha and Āryāvarta while the word Āṭavikarāja
<div n="lb"/>breaks the link between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>all the border states mentioned in the inscription could not
<div n="lb"/>have been Mleccha and inhabited by Kirātas.<sup>644</sup> The word
<div n="lb"/>Pratyanta and its substitutes in the Aśokan edicts also refer to
<div n="lb"/>the frontier states.
