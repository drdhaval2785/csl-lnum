1. {%Devarāṣṭra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 20):
<div n="P"/>It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings
<div n="lb"/>ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>Dey<sup>16</sup> identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra).
<div n="lb"/>Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas
<div n="lb"/>slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with
<div n="lb"/>modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.<sup>17</sup> According to R.D.
<div n="lb"/>Banerjee<sup>18</sup> Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga. B.C. Law<sup>19</sup> identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of
<div n="lb"/>the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Ray-
<div n="lb"/>chaudhuri,<sup>20</sup> S.B. Chaudhuri,<sup>21</sup> Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.<sup>22</sup> This
<div n="lb"/>view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the
<div n="lb"/>eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious
<div n="lb"/>difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas.
<div n="lb"/>Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent
<div n="lb"/>that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tām-
<div n="lb"/>ralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
<div n="P"/>L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called
<div n="lb"/>Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>Nāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this
<div n="lb"/>maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>Nāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The
<div n="lb"/>word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a
<div n="lb"/>country of the Nāgas’.
