9. {%Rūpaśarmman%}¦ (No. 43, LL. 7-8):
<div n="lb"/>{%Rūpa%} means ‘form, figure, beauty’. Here it may mean beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful. We have similar names, e.g., Rūpalal, Sunderlal, Rūpa-
<div n="lb"/>chand, etc., in modern times. The first part of the name is
<div n="lb"/>based on a virtue, i.e. ‘beauty’. It would mean ‘one who is
<div n="lb"/>beautiful’.
