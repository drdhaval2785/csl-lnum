19. {%Saiṃhalaka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>Inhabitants of Siṃhala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along
<div n="lb"/>with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas,
<div n="lb"/>and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of
<div n="lb"/>Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)<sup>434</sup> who paid homage
<div n="lb"/>to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing
<div n="lb"/>presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial
<div n="lb"/>Gupta Garuḍa seal ({%Garutmadaṅka%}) by which they would be
<div n="lb"/>left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment ({%bhukti%}) and
<div n="lb"/>administration ({%śāsana%}) of their respective territories.<sup>435</sup> If
<div n="lb"/>literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people
<div n="lb"/>mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta.
[Page-159+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states
<div n="lb"/>were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṃhala
<div n="lb"/>(Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great
<div n="lb"/>doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justi-
<div n="lb"/>fied in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense
<div n="lb"/>without corroborative evidence.<sup>436</sup> But the question arises that
<div n="lb"/>was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his
<div n="lb"/>Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?<sup>437</sup>
<div n="P"/>So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an
<div n="lb"/>independent evidence of its political relation with Samuda-
<div n="lb"/>gupta.
<div n="P"/>We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62)
<div n="lb"/>of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa ({%chi-mi-kia-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%po-mo%} = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of Samudragupta ({%San-meou-to-lo-kin-to%}).<sup>438</sup> He,
<div n="lb"/>according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to
<div n="lb"/>visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience
<div n="lb"/>for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty
<div n="lb"/>for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to
<div n="lb"/>found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission,
<div n="lb"/>and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north
<div n="lb"/>of the Bodhi tree.<sup>439</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magni-
<div n="lb"/>ficant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the
<div n="lb"/>pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grand-
<div n="lb"/>eur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its
<div n="lb"/>foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in
<div n="lb"/>tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It
<div n="lb"/>is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich
<div n="lb"/>presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's
<div n="lb"/>prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application
<div n="lb"/>for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’,
<div n="lb"/>one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into
<div n="lb"/>which Siṃhala is included”.<sup>440</sup>
<div n="P"/>Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhami-
<div n="lb"/>hira<sup>441</sup> mentions both of them separately as situated in the
<div n="lb"/>South.
<div n="P"/>Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars
<div n="lb"/>with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,<sup>442</sup> with Maldives,<sup>443</sup> with the
[Page-160+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay
<div n="lb"/>of Bengal,<sup>444</sup> and with an island off the south-east Coast of Cey-
<div n="lb"/>lon.<sup>445</sup> All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>446</sup> who
<div n="lb"/>remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gra-
<div n="lb"/>tuitous.<sup>447</sup> He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while
<div n="lb"/>entreating Sītā to be his wife says: {%“Laṅkānāma samudrasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”%}<sup>448</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategi-
<div n="lb"/>cal position of Laṅkā: {%Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.%}<sup>449</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with {%‘Purīm Laṅkām’%}
<div n="lb"/>writes: {%“Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.%}<sup>450</sup>
<div n="lb"/>With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: {%sa%}
<div n="lb"/>{%setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.%}<sup>451</sup> In the Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa<sup>452</sup> and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references
<div n="lb"/>to Laṇkā.<sup>453</sup> All these passages point distinctly to the great sea
<div n="lb"/>on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā.
<div n="P"/>The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from
<div n="lb"/>Ceylon.<sup>454</sup> This is hardly convincing for the separate mention
<div n="lb"/>of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra
<div n="lb"/>and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material
<div n="lb"/>geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible
<div n="lb"/>terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic
<div n="lb"/>lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name.
<div n="lb"/>As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed
<div n="lb"/>off as a {%dvīpa,%} and the two names were used in the same
<div n="lb"/>geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus:
<div n="lb"/>{%“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.%}<sup>455</sup> Hiuen
<div n="lb"/>Tsang also mentions {%Seng-ka-lo%} (Ceylon) which included {%Leug-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ka%} (Laṅkā).<sup>456</sup> As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa
<div n="lb"/>and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion)
<div n="lb"/>was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.<sup>457</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.<sup>458</sup> We may assume further, as seems
<div n="lb"/>very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its
<div n="lb"/>literary name as well. Mention is made of {%Laṅkādvīpa%} even in
<div n="lb"/>medieval inscriptions.<sup>459</sup> The Madras museum plates of Jaṭila-
<div n="lb"/>varman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as {%Ilangai.%}<sup>460</sup> Epi-
<div n="lb"/>graphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name
[Page-161+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad
<div n="lb"/>plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.<sup>461</sup> In another
<div n="lb"/>inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the
<div n="lb"/>shore.<sup>462</sup> In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated
<div n="lb"/>as Siṅgala-deśam,<sup>463</sup> Sīlam<sup>464</sup> and Sihala.<sup>465</sup> All this evidence
<div n="lb"/>favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also
<div n="lb"/>used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably,
<div n="lb"/>correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for
<div n="lb"/>Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī,
<div n="lb"/>and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by {%Palaesi-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%mundus%} or {%Palaesimoundon%} which itself was transformed into
<div n="lb"/>{%Salike, Sereṇdiva%} derived from Pali {%Sihala%} or {%Sihala dīpa.%}<sup>466</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The name {%Palaesimoundon%} is very plausibly based on {%“pāre%}
<div n="lb"/>{%samudrasya”,%}<sup>467</sup> in the description given of Laṅkā as noted
<div n="lb"/>above. Ptolemy's Simoundon<sup>468</sup> also refers to that name. But
<div n="lb"/>in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called {%Salike%} which
<div n="lb"/>responds to {%Siele diba%} of {%Kosmas Indicopleustes%}<sup>469</sup> both of
<div n="lb"/>which have their sources in {%Sihalam%} “the Pāli form of Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other
<div n="lb"/>names such as {%Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,%}<sup>470</sup> the last one yielding
<div n="lb"/>to Ceylon. Marco Polo's {%Seilan%}<sup>471</sup> is a nearer approach to the
<div n="lb"/>modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have
<div n="lb"/>been derived from {%Sela%} or ‘precious stone’, hence the island
<div n="lb"/>was anciently called {%Ratnadvīpa.%}<sup>472</sup> An Arab historian called
<div n="lb"/>it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island
<div n="lb"/>also implies reference to gems. The name {%Sailān%} also occurs in
<div n="lb"/>the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.<sup>473</sup> Al-Beruni
<div n="lb"/>called it {%Singaldīb.%}<sup>474</sup> Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once
<div n="lb"/>abounding in lions.<sup>475</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here that there are references to another
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.<sup>476</sup> It was placed to the
<div n="lb"/>east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evi-
<div n="lb"/>dently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom of {%Siṃhapura%} mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.
