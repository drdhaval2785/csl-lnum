3. {%Āṭavika-rāja%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the
<div n="lb"/>kings of the forest countries his servants.<sup>76</sup> A mention
<div n="lb"/>of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper
<div n="lb"/>plate inscription of Saṃkshobha Gupta year 209.<sup>77</sup> These
<div n="lb"/>18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India
<div n="lb"/>including Ḍāhala or the Jabalpur region. <sup>78</sup> We find a refe-
<div n="lb"/>rence to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.<sup>79</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Vāyu and Matsya Purāṇas (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48)
<div n="lb"/>read Āṭavyas which is no doubt the correct reading. Āṭavī as
<div n="lb"/>a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.<sup>80</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal
<div n="lb"/>tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.<sup>81</sup> We find
[Page-129+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the
<div n="lb"/>Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice
<div n="lb"/>to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,<sup>82</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>needs must influence their future advance to civilization.
<div n="lb"/>Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of
<div n="lb"/>forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic
<div n="lb"/>List of Peoples.<sup>83</sup> Similar terms {%‘vana-rāṣṭra’%} ‘forest-countries’
<div n="lb"/>and {%vana-rājya%} ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>84</sup> But these countries lay in the north-east division
<div n="lb"/>of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at
<div n="lb"/>any rate, not the countries referred here.<sup>85</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva's {%digvijaya,%} Professor Franklin Edgerton changes
<div n="lb"/>{%Āṭavī%} to {%Antākhi,%} so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome
<div n="lb"/>and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately
<div n="lb"/>associated in history and consequently they are still associated
<div n="lb"/>in the minds of Western scholars, and hence {%Antākhi%} made
<div n="lb"/>more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks than {%Āṭavī.%} But it only represents his personal opi-
<div n="lb"/>nion.<sup>86</sup>
