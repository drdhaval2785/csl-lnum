7. {%Vargga, Vargga-grāmika%}¦ (No. 46, L. 12, L. 15):
<div n="lb"/>He was the middle son of Hari-śreṣṭhin. In L. 12 he is men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned only as Vargga and in L. 15 as Vargga-grāmika. While
<div n="lb"/>his father is called a {%śreṣṭhin%} he was not {%śreṣṭhin%} or banker by
<div n="lb"/>profession. The word {%grāmika%} affixed to Vargga's name suggests
<div n="lb"/>that he was the headman of a village which seems to be no
<div n="lb"/>other than Avaḍāra. Vargga literally means one who excludes
<div n="lb"/>or removes or averts’.<sup>7</sup>
