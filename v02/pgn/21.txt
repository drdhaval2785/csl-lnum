5. {%Candradevī<sup>121</sup>%}¦ (No. 47, L. 7; No. 53, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>The name of the mother of Budhagupta occurring at the be-
<div n="lb"/>ginning of the extant portion of line 7 is not clearly legible; it
[Page-031+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>consists of four letters, the first of which is either {%ca%} or {%va%} and
<div n="lb"/>the second is certainly {%n%} with some subscript mark or letter;
<div n="lb"/>the third and fourth letters clearly read {%devyām.%} It is, therefore,
<div n="lb"/>highly probable that her name was Candradevī, known from
<div n="lb"/>some seals to have been the name of the queen of Pūrugupta.
<div n="lb"/>Hiranand Shastri takes the relevant legend to be {%‘Śrīvainya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%devyām’%}<sup>122</sup> but regards the correct reading to be {%Candra%} in place
<div n="lb"/>of {%Vainya.%}<sup>123</sup>
<div n="P"/>No. 47 mentions Candradevī as the name of the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃhagupta.
<div n="P"/>In No. 53 Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Budha-
<div n="lb"/>gupta and wife of Pūrugupta.
<div n="P"/>The name Candradevī is based on the god Candra (Moon).
