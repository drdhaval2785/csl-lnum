8. {%Nakhaddārccarika-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>The expression means the field of Nakhaddārccarika. The word
<div n="lb"/>Nakhaddārccarika is a puzzle but it can be possibly explained
<div n="lb"/>as the worshipper of Nakṣatras, i. e. an astronomer.<sup>509</sup> Nakṣa-
<div n="lb"/>tra changes to nakkhatta<sup>510</sup> in Prakrit. Nakha and ṇakkha are
<div n="lb"/>identical,<sup>511</sup> tta in nakkhatta changes to dda in sandhi here. The
<div n="lb"/>word ‘arccarika’ means a ‘worshipper’.<sup>512</sup> Stars were regarded
<div n="lb"/>as deities to whom regular worship (bhakti) was shown. The
<div n="lb"/>names based on stars were unknown in Vedic literature but
<div n="lb"/>became popular in the time of Pāṇini and later.<sup>513</sup>
