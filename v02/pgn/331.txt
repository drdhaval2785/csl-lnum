18. {%Ṣāhi%}¦<sup>428</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>The Ṣāhis are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjec-
<div n="lb"/>tive of Ṣāhi as Goyal<sup>429</sup> has surmised and has identified it
<div n="lb"/>with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family.
<div n="P"/>Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas;
<div n="lb"/>so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must
<div n="lb"/>have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be
<div n="lb"/>identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṃśa in
<div n="lb"/>connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.<sup>430</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>431</sup> identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians.
<div n="lb"/>The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and
<div n="lb"/>is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis
<div n="lb"/>are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to
<div n="lb"/>the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as
<div n="lb"/>‘Shāh of Iran’.
<div n="P"/>Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some
<div n="lb"/>relation with Sanskrit root {%§śās%} to rule, which when formed a
<div n="lb"/>noun means ‘a ruler’. <sup>432</sup> The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted
<div n="lb"/>by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was
<div n="lb"/>also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni
<div n="lb"/>and Kalhaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The word {%Śāha%} or {%Sāhu,%} often used for banias in villages,
<div n="lb"/>is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit {%‘sādhu’.%}<sup>433</sup>
