12. {%Mālava%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11):
<div n="lb"/>We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with
<div n="lb"/>some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the
<div n="lb"/>Mālava-gaṇa<sup>292</sup> which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal
<div n="lb"/>constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some
<div n="lb"/>formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.<sup>293</sup> Fleet fixes
[Page-147+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>it up as 57-56 B.C.<sup>294</sup> Thomas<sup>295</sup> translates the expression as
<div n="lb"/>“the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of
<div n="lb"/>the Mālavas” and adds “It was to {%gaṇa-sthiti,%} not to {%gaṇa,%} that
<div n="lb"/>I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not intro-
<div n="lb"/>duce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is
<div n="lb"/>“the usage of the Mālava tribe.”<sup>296</sup> Thus the expression {%‘Māla-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vānām gaṇa’%} refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of
<div n="lb"/>the Mālava-vaṃśa which has been translated as ‘the race of
<div n="lb"/>the Mālavas,<sup>297</sup> but it would be better to translate it as “the
<div n="lb"/>dynasty of the Mālavas”.<sup>298</sup> It seems that this tribe had esta-
<div n="lb"/>blished independent rulership and so we find the word {%‘vaṃśa’%}
<div n="lb"/>used where the word {%‘gaṇa’%} could also be used<sup>299</sup>
<div n="P"/>Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were
<div n="lb"/>the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as {%‘dra’%} is changed
<div n="lb"/>into {%‘ll’.%} He identifies {%Malla%} with the Malloi of the Greeks
<div n="lb"/>and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>pati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their
<div n="lb"/>mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra
<div n="lb"/>and Mālava were identical.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but
<div n="lb"/>side by side as people of the North.<sup>301</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in
<div n="lb"/>Rajasthan and West Malwa<sup>302</sup> consisting of Mewar, Tonk and
<div n="lb"/>adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.<sup>303</sup> They settled in
<div n="lb"/>various localities in Western India after having migrated from
<div n="lb"/>the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower
<div n="lb"/>banks of Ravi.<sup>304</sup> Their original home was in Jhang District,
<div n="lb"/>Punjab. <sup>305</sup> Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa
<div n="lb"/>and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from
<div n="lb"/>them.<sup>306</sup> That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region
<div n="lb"/>(Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from
<div n="lb"/>right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the
<div n="lb"/>Punjab and the north-west from very early times.<sup>307</sup> The Sikhs
<div n="lb"/>of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are
<div n="lb"/>still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions
<div n="lb"/>were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.<sup>308</sup> Mālava
<div n="lb"/>and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is
[Page-148+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminu-
<div n="lb"/>tive suffix {%‘ka’.%}<sup>309</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mālava is the same as {%Malloi%} of the Greeks.<sup>310</sup> Pāṇini does
<div n="lb"/>not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of
<div n="lb"/>{%‘āyudhajīvī saṃghas’,%} or tribes living by the profession of arms,
<div n="lb"/>and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṃghas were the
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.<sup>311</sup> The Mālava tribe is actually men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Tri-
<div n="lb"/>garttas,<sup>313</sup> as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.<sup>314</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajas-
<div n="lb"/>than where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>315</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the
<div n="lb"/>legend. {%“Mālavānām jayaḥ”%} (victory of the Mālavas) in letters
<div n="lb"/>belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According
<div n="lb"/>to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their
<div n="lb"/>tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.<sup>316</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣava-
<div n="lb"/>dāta who subdued them.<sup>317</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Purāṇas<sup>318</sup> the Mālavas are associated with
<div n="lb"/>the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell
<div n="lb"/>along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupi-
<div n="lb"/>ed other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter
<div n="lb"/>points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas
<div n="lb"/>lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near pre-
<div n="lb"/>sent Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly
<div n="lb"/>śūdra in the Purāṇas.<sup>319</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western
<div n="lb"/>(pratīcya) and northern ({%udīcya%}) sections of the Mālavas.<sup>320</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. <sup>321</sup> Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>sūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than
<div n="lb"/>the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical
<div n="lb"/>with Ujjayinī-deśa, is {%apara-Mālava.%}<sup>322</sup> This has led some
<div n="lb"/>writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>maṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.<sup>323</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier
<div n="lb"/>authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā
<div n="lb"/>and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side
[Page-149+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>by side<sup>324</sup> Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and
<div n="lb"/>Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is
<div n="lb"/>proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon
<div n="lb"/>the Mandasor princes.<sup>325</sup> An inscription describes the subjuga-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory
<div n="lb"/>of Vikramāditya VI.<sup>326</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’
<div n="lb"/>generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman
<div n="lb"/>Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana.
<div n="lb"/>B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga
<div n="lb"/>and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.<sup>327</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District
<div n="lb"/>in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all
<div n="lb"/>over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated
<div n="lb"/>to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an
<div n="lb"/>independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience
<div n="lb"/>of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps
<div n="lb"/>from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted
<div n="lb"/>itself again.<sup>328</sup> In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to
<div n="lb"/>have migrated further to the east and covered the region from
<div n="lb"/>Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.<sup>329</sup> During the rule of the
<div n="lb"/>Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east;
<div n="lb"/>for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla),
<div n="lb"/>refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.<sup>330</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of
<div n="lb"/>Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found
<div n="lb"/>also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.<sup>331</sup>
