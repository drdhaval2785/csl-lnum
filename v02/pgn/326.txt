13. {%Mleccha%}¦ (No. 14, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>According to Sircar<sup>332</sup> Fleet conjectures the reading to be
<div n="lb"/>Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after {%‘ni’%} are not legible.
<div n="lb"/>So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any
<div n="lb"/>doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war
<div n="lb"/>with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas
<div n="lb"/>which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription.
<div n="lb"/>Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a
[Page-150+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that
<div n="lb"/>Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.<sup>333</sup> The fact
<div n="lb"/>that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling
<div n="lb"/>fortunes of the family supports the identification.
<div n="P"/>We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by
<div n="lb"/>the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play {%Mudrā-Rākṣasa%} written
<div n="lb"/>by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be
<div n="lb"/>protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue
<div n="lb"/>by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written
<div n="lb"/>after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha
<div n="lb"/>in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar<sup>334</sup> is of the view that Mleccha is the name
<div n="lb"/>applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have
<div n="lb"/>been any general term for a foreigner. But as the {%Dāsa, Dasyu,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Barbara,%} and {%Mleccha%} became more or less absorbed in Āryan
<div n="lb"/>civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms
<div n="lb"/>was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for
<div n="lb"/>any foreigner.<sup>335</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and
<div n="lb"/>western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost
<div n="lb"/>any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was
<div n="lb"/>after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.<sup>336</sup> When not
<div n="lb"/>used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is
<div n="lb"/>used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived
<div n="lb"/>from the root {%§mlich~mlech,%}<sup>337</sup> meaning to speak indistinctly
<div n="lb"/>(like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit).
<div n="lb"/>We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct
<div n="lb"/>speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (proto-
<div n="lb"/>Tibetan) {%mltśe%} “tongue”, Old Bodish {%ltśe,%} Kukish generally
<div n="lb"/>{%mlei,%} the combination of initial consonants ({%mltś%} — ) being
<div n="lb"/>simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages.
<div n="lb"/>Aspiration cannot occur after {%I%} in old Bodish; and the proto-
<div n="lb"/>Bodish form may have been {%mltse%} for all we know, so the {%‘cch’%}
<div n="lb"/>of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate
[Page-151+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages.
<div n="lb"/>Since {%‘mleche’%} would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit,
<div n="lb"/>{%mleccha%} would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to
<div n="lb"/>it”.<sup>339</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mleccha<sup>340</sup> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>341</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are for-
<div n="lb"/>bidden to use barbarian speech. The example<sup>342</sup> given of such
<div n="lb"/>speech is {%“he' layo”,%} explained by Sāyaṇa as {%“he' rayaḥ”,%} “ho,
<div n="lb"/>foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though
<div n="lb"/>not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speech.<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and
<div n="lb"/>Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.<sup>344</sup> The Jain Prajñāpanā
<div n="lb"/>records two divisions of the people of India — {%Milikkha%} and
<div n="lb"/>Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of
<div n="lb"/>which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya,
<div n="lb"/>Pārasa and Khasa.<sup>345</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>346</sup> states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the
<div n="lb"/>Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the
<div n="lb"/>Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes
<div n="lb"/>them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.<sup>347</sup>
<div n="lb"/>They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant
<div n="lb"/>about the Dharma (righteous conduct).<sup>348</sup> At another place,
<div n="lb"/>it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they
<div n="lb"/>follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy)
<div n="lb"/>yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and
<div n="lb"/>the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.<sup>349</sup> This makes it
<div n="lb"/>clear that the people not following the righteous conduct
<div n="lb"/>according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign,
<div n="lb"/>were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata<sup>350</sup> shows that
<div n="lb"/>the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas
<div n="lb"/>and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas
<div n="lb"/>as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and
<div n="lb"/>describes them as fierce and cruel.<sup>351</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the {%Manu-Smṛti%}<sup>352</sup> the king is advised to exclude at
<div n="lb"/>deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds,
<div n="lb"/>the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and
<div n="lb"/>deformed. At another place in the {%Manu-Smṛti%} where the girls
<div n="lb"/>bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called
[Page-152+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>after the {%Antyas%} or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake,
<div n="lb"/>or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage,
<div n="lb"/>Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word {%Antya%} as
<div n="lb"/>representing the Mlecchas.<sup>353</sup> From the Manu<sup>354</sup> it is clear
<div n="lb"/>that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans.
<div n="P"/>The {%Vāyu, Matsya%} and {%Brahmāṇḍa%} Purāṇas state that the
<div n="lb"/>seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.<sup>355</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the {%Varāha Purāṇa,%} a place named Lohārgala is stated to be
<div n="lb"/>ruled over by the Mleccha kings.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amara-kośa<sup>357</sup> describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and
<div n="lb"/>Pulindas as the {%Mlecchajātis.%} The Bṛhat-Saṃhitā<sup>358</sup> places
<div n="lb"/>them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places
<div n="lb"/>them under the jurisdiction of {%Maṅgala graha%}<sup>359</sup> and assigns
<div n="lb"/>them the region of {%Rāhu graha,%} inhabiting the mountain-tops,
<div n="lb"/>low-regions or the caves.<sup>360</sup> In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all
<div n="lb"/>places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as
<div n="lb"/>{%Mi-li-ku,%} i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.<sup>361</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Ārya-mañjūśrī-Mūla-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently
<div n="lb"/>appear as the companions of robbers.<sup>362</sup> In the Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>Sāgara,<sup>363</sup> the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are
<div n="lb"/>stated to have killed brāhmaṇas, interfered with sacrifices, and
<div n="lb"/>carried off the daughters of hermits.<sup>364</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī<sup>365</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoin-
<div n="lb"/>ing the Himalayas.
<div n="P"/>In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied
<div n="lb"/>indiscriminately to all foreigners.<sup>366</sup> The Mleccha army of the
<div n="lb"/>Gwalior Praśasti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.<sup>367</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to
<div n="lb"/>Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Siddhānta-Kaumudī<sup>369</sup> describes the {%Kṣudhunas%} as the
<div n="lb"/>Mlecchas. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra (a work of the 17th
<div n="lb"/>century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Mahām-
<div n="lb"/>leccha (verses 28, 30) and {%Mleccha-mārga%} (verse 31) where they
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned along with Pāñcāla, Kāmboja and Bāhlīka and
<div n="lb"/>the Khurāśan country is described as the {%Mleccha-mārga.%}<sup>370</sup>
