3. {%Candragupta I:%}¦ (No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 40, L. 3;
<div n="lb"/>No. 21, L. 5; No. 1, L. 28; No. 30, L. 1):
<div n="lb"/>While his two predecessors are each given the title of
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahārāja,%} Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahārājādhirāja,%} ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage
<div n="lb"/>from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory
<div n="lb"/>with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>I.<sup>53</sup> It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘Kaumudī-
<div n="lb"/>Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by
<div n="lb"/>the drama and the inscriptions.<sup>54</sup> Other details of the drama,
<div n="lb"/>however, do not support this identification. The drama
<div n="lb"/>condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste
<div n="lb"/>whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out
<div n="lb"/>to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but
<div n="lb"/>Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth
<div n="lb"/>act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī
<div n="lb"/>that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family
<div n="lb"/>uprooted.<sup>55</sup> Thus we know about the total annihilation of the
<div n="lb"/>dynasty after the death of Caṇḍasena which is not applicable
<div n="lb"/>to the dynasty of Caṇḍragupta which ruled for several genera-
<div n="lb"/>tions after him.<sup>56</sup> The name of the deity {%Candra%} ‘moon’ has
<div n="lb"/>been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer
<div n="lb"/>to his handsome physical features.
