3. {%Kāmarūpa%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were
<div n="lb"/>subordinate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him
[Page-254+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar<sup>539</sup> identifies it with
<div n="lb"/>Upper Assam. Kāmarūpa consisted of the Western districts of
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state
<div n="lb"/>and being the first to be approached from the western side
<div n="lb"/>came to denote the whole valley.<sup>540</sup> The area of Kāmarūpa
<div n="lb"/>was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have
<div n="lb"/>been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it
<div n="lb"/>must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.<sup>541</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Śaktisaṅgama describes<sup>542</sup> Kāmarūpa as extending from Kāle-
<div n="lb"/>śvara to the Śvetagiri and from Tripura to the Nīla-parvata
<div n="lb"/>(which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā
<div n="lb"/>hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>rūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together
<div n="lb"/>with Rangpur and Cochbihar.<sup>543</sup> The Purāṇas mention Prāg-
<div n="lb"/>jyotiṣa, identified with Kāmākhyā or Gauhati, as the capital of
<div n="lb"/>Kāmarūpa.<sup>544</sup> The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions
<div n="lb"/>Kāmarūpa as a Maṇḍala of the Prāgjyotiṣa-bhukti.<sup>545</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Abhidhāna, the Vaijayantī and the Trikāṇḍaśeṣa in-
<div n="lb"/>form us that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same coun-
<div n="lb"/>try.<sup>546</sup> In the Raghuvaṃśa,<sup>547</sup> the separate mention of Prāg-
<div n="lb"/>jyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But
<div n="lb"/>we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to
<div n="lb"/>the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses
<div n="lb"/>describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects
<div n="lb"/>by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses
<div n="lb"/>are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Prāgjyotiṣa
<div n="lb"/>and Kāmarūpa were the same.<sup>548</sup> The Buddhist Chronicle
<div n="lb"/>Ārya-mañjuśrī-mūlakalpa describes Kāmarūpa as a country of
<div n="lb"/>the east.<sup>549</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>550</sup> and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<sup>551</sup>
<div n="lb"/>also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that
<div n="lb"/>the tribes living on the frontiers of Kāmarūpa were akin to the
<div n="lb"/>Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese
<div n="lb"/>people.<sup>552</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the be-
<div n="lb"/>ginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese
<div n="lb"/>empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of the 19th century.<sup>553</sup>
