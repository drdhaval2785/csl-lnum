1. {%Bali%}¦ (No. 14, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>The reference to Bali comes in connection with the praise of
<div n="lb"/>Lord Viṣṇu.<sup>57</sup> Literally meaning ‘one who is powerful or
<div n="lb"/>vigorous’, Bali was the son of Virocana and the grandson of
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda and has been the king of the Asuras.<sup>58</sup> A famous
<div n="lb"/>legend about him runs thus — The demon Bali, by his austeri-
<div n="lb"/>ties acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused
<div n="lb"/>annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Viṣṇu then reincarnated
<div n="lb"/>himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as
<div n="lb"/>much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented
<div n="lb"/>to his request, and Viṣṇu with two strides covered the heavens
<div n="lb"/>and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then
<div n="lb"/>humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower
<div n="lb"/>regions below the earth.<sup>59</sup> We get a reference to this legend
<div n="lb"/>as early as in the Viṣṇusūkta of the Ṛgveda.<sup>60</sup>
