4. {%Duḍika%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>He was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of {%Caturvedins%}
<div n="lb"/>of the locality known as Padmā in the city of Indrapura. He
<div n="lb"/>has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa Devaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance
<div n="lb"/>of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun.
<div n="P"/>It is an abbreviated name with the ending {%“ika”%}<sup>12</sup> like
<div n="lb"/>Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika
<div n="lb"/>for Chandodatta.<sup>13</sup>
[Page-090+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’<sup>14</sup> cannot be
<div n="lb"/>derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found
<div n="lb"/>in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia
<div n="lb"/>suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>term Dardara,<sup>15</sup> meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having
<div n="lb"/>holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly
<div n="lb"/>region.
<div n="P"/>We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddara-
<div n="lb"/>pabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.<sup>16</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>{%Daddarapabbata%} may be identified with the mountainous tract
<div n="lb"/>of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south
<div n="lb"/>of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the
<div n="lb"/>Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls
<div n="lb"/>the river {%Dāradī Sindhuḥ.%}<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of this tract, the {%Daradas%} are mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up
<div n="lb"/>along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's {%āśrama.<sup>18</sup>%} The Daradas are the
<div n="lb"/>people, living above Peshawar.<sup>19</sup> But the basic weakness in the
<div n="lb"/>suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia<sup>20</sup> is, as he himself
<div n="lb"/>admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit
<div n="lb"/>dictionary.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are syno-
<div n="lb"/>nyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī,
<div n="lb"/>or a brāhmaṇa-woman.<sup>21</sup> These are deśya words and hence
<div n="lb"/>refer to local elements.
<div n="P"/>In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credu-
<div n="lb"/>lous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is
<div n="lb"/>not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish
<div n="lb"/>approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple
<div n="lb"/>person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped.
<div n="lb"/>Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and
<div n="lb"/>the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. {%‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’%}
<div n="lb"/>or {%‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’%} a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also
<div n="lb"/>used in satire.
[Page-091+ 37]
<div n="P"/>It is interesting to note that {%Ḍaḍḍa%} is also an English slang
<div n="lb"/>word meaning ‘a foolish person’.
