2. {%Bāhlīka%}¦<sup>570</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses,
<div n="lb"/>saffron and Ferula Asafoetida ({%hiṅgu%}).
<div n="P"/>The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>571</sup> The reading
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu of the passage<sup>572</sup> is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which
<div n="lb"/>is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of
<div n="lb"/>Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was border-
<div n="lb"/>ed on the Oxus.<sup>573</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>574</sup> places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of
<div n="lb"/>the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the
<div n="lb"/>Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>575</sup> We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī,
<div n="lb"/>queen of the Madras.<sup>576</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the
<div n="lb"/>{%Bhāllavins%} enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern
<div n="lb"/>sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and
<div n="lb"/>Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār
<div n="lb"/>and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, liv-
<div n="lb"/>ing in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan
<div n="lb"/>Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung
<div n="lb"/>Bāhlika tribes.<sup>577</sup> There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrat-
<div n="lb"/>ing from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.<sup>578</sup>
<div n="P"/>When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh-
[Page-171+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>ist faith,<sup>579</sup> but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by
<div n="lb"/>the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territor-
<div n="lb"/>ies passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the
<div n="lb"/>Muhammadan power.<sup>580</sup>
