{@Viṣāṇin@}¦ occurs once in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the name of a tribe in
<div n="lb"/>the list of the enemies of the {@Tṛtsus,@} not as Roth<sup>2</sup> thought, of
<div n="lb"/>their allies. The word seems to mean ‘having horns,’ but in what
<div n="lb"/>sense is unknown; perhaps their helmets were horn-shaped or
<div n="lb"/>ornamented with horns. They may, like their allies, the {@Alinas,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Bhalānas, Śivas,@} and {@Pakthas,@} be reckoned as belonging to the
<div n="lb"/>tribes of the north-west.
