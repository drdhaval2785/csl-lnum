<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> that in times of peace there was no king in some

<div n="lb"/>Rājan, and is not decisive for the sense ascribed to it by
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer. Of course this state of affairs is perfectly possible,
<div n="lb"/>and is exemplified later in Buddhist times.<sup>5</sup>
