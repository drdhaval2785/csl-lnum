{@Vidhavā@}¦ denotes ‘widow’ as the ‘desolate one,’ from the
<div n="lb"/>root {%vidh,%} ‘be bereft.’ The masculine {%vidhava%} is conjectured
[Page2-300+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>by Roth<sup>1</sup> in a difficult passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>received text presents the apparent false concord {%vidhantaṃ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vidhavām,%} in which he sees a metrical lengthening for {%vidhavam,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘the sacrificing widower.’ Ludwig in his version takes {%vidh-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%antam%} as equivalent to a feminine, while Delbrück<sup>3</sup> prefers
<div n="lb"/>‘the worshipper and the widow.’ Possibly ‘the widower and
<div n="lb"/>the widow’ may be meant; but we know nothing of the
<div n="lb"/>mythological allusion in question, the feat being one of those
<div n="lb"/>attributed to the Aśvins, and the natural reference to {@Ghoṣā@} as
<div n="lb"/>‘husbandless’ being rendered unlikely because their feat in
<div n="lb"/>regard to her has already been mentioned a few verses before in
<div n="lb"/>the same hymn.<sup>4</sup> The word Vidhavā is not of common
<div n="lb"/>occurrence.<sup>5</sup>
