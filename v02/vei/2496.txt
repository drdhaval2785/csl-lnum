{@Muni@}¦ occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> where it seems to
<div n="lb"/>denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus ({%deveṣita%}),
<div n="lb"/>the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This
<div n="lb"/>agrees with the fact that {@Aitaśa,@} the Muni, is in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> regarded by his son as deranged, a view not
<div n="lb"/>unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>‘Chatter of Aitaśa,’ was really his. The Rigveda<sup>4</sup> calls Indra
<div n="lb"/>the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> refers to a ‘divine
<div n="lb"/>Muni’ ({%deva muni%}), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant.
<div n="P"/>In the Upaniṣads<sup>6</sup> the Muni is of a more restrained type:
<div n="lb"/>he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute,
<div n="lb"/>by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith ({%śraddhā%}).
<div n="lb"/>It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute
<div n="lb"/>distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both
<div n="lb"/>cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal
<div n="lb"/>of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the
<div n="lb"/>Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor
<div n="lb"/>would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness
[Page2-168+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was
<div n="lb"/>an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not
<div n="lb"/>approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose
<div n="lb"/>views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni,
<div n="lb"/>which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the
<div n="lb"/>desire for children and {@Dakṣiṇās.@}<sup>7</sup>
