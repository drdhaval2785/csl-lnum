3. {@Kṛṣṇa Devakī-putra@}¦ is mentioned in the Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>1</sup> as a pupil of the mythical {@Ghora Āṅgirasa.@}
<div n="lb"/>Tradition,<sup>2</sup> and several modern writers like Grierson, Garbe,
<div n="lb"/>and von Schroeder, recognize in him the hero Kṛṣṇa, who later
<div n="lb"/>is deified. In their view he is a Kṣatriya teacher of morals, as
<div n="lb"/>opposed to Brahminism.<sup>3</sup> This is extremely doubtful. It
<div n="lb"/>appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as
<div n="lb"/>accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of
<div n="lb"/>Euhemerism. To identify this Kṛṣṇa with the preceding,
<div n="lb"/>as does the St. Petersburg Dictionary, seems to be quite
<div n="lb"/>groundless.
