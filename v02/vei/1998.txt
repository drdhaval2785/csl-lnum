{@Pratī-darśa Śvaikna@}¦ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>1</sup> as sacrificing with the Dākṣāyaṇa offering, and as
<div n="lb"/>teaching {@Suplan Sārñjaya,@} who thence became {@Sahadeva@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Sārñjaya.@} In a second passage<sup>2</sup> he is called Pratīdarśa
<div n="lb"/>Aibhāvata, and again brought into connexion with Suplan
<div n="lb"/>Sārñjaya. According to Eggeling,<sup>3</sup> he is to be deemed a king
<div n="lb"/>of the Śviknas; apparently, too, he was a descendant of
<div n="lb"/>Ibhāvant. A Pratīdarśa is also mentioned in the Jaiminīya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup>
