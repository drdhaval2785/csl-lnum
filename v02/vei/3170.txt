{@Śambara@}¦ is the name of an enemy of Indra in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned along with {@Śuṣṇa, Pipru,@} and {@Varcin,@} being
<div n="lb"/>in one passage called a {@Dāsa,@} son of Kulitara.<sup>2</sup> In another
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>3</sup> he is said to have deemed himself a godling ({%devaka%}).
<div n="lb"/>His forts, ninety,<sup>4</sup> ninety-nine,<sup>5</sup> or a hundred<sup>6</sup> in number, are
<div n="lb"/>alluded to, the word itself in the neuter plural once<sup>7</sup> meaning
<div n="lb"/>the ‘forts of Śambara.’ His great foe was {@Divodāsa Ati-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@thigva,@} who won victories over him by Indra's aid.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say with certainty whether Śambara was
<div n="lb"/>a real person or not. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> is strongly in favour of the
<div n="lb"/>theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divodāsa: he
<div n="lb"/>relies on the statistics<sup>10</sup> of the mention of the name to show
<div n="lb"/>that, where as he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of
<div n="lb"/>the time of Divodāsa, later texts, like those of the seventh
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of
<div n="lb"/>scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from
<div n="lb"/>this theory, Śambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy
<div n="lb"/>in India, living in the mountains.<sup>11</sup>
