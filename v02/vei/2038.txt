{@Pra-śāstṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the priests ({@Ṛtvij@}) at the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic sacrifice. In the lesser sacrifices he plays no part at all,
<div n="lb"/>but he appears in the animal ({%paśu%}) and Soma sacrifices, in the
<div n="lb"/>former as the only, in the latter as the main, assistant of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Hotṛ@} priest in the singing of the litanies. He is mentioned by
<div n="lb"/>name in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and often later.<sup>2</sup> He is also in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>3</sup> called {@Upavaktṛ,@} this name, like Praśāstṛ, being
<div n="lb"/>derived from the fact that one of his chief functions was to
<div n="lb"/>issue directions ({%praiṣa%}) to the other priests. Another name
<div n="lb"/>for him was Maitrāvaruṇa, because his litanies were mainly
<div n="lb"/>addressed to Mitra and Varuṇa, a connexion already visible in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> The ‘two divine Hotṛs’ of the Āprī litanies
<div n="lb"/>denote, according to Oldenberg,<sup>5</sup> the heavenly counterparts of
<div n="lb"/>the Hotṛ and the Praśāstṛ.
