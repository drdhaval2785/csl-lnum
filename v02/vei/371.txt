{@Upala-prakṣiṇī@}¦ occurs once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it desig-
<div n="lb"/>nates the occupation of a woman, as opposed to that of her
<div n="lb"/>son, who is a poet ({%kāru%}), and to that of his father, who is a
<div n="lb"/>physician ({%bhiṣaj%}). Yāska<sup>2</sup> renders the word by ‘maker of
<div n="lb"/>groats’ ({%saktu-kārikā%}), and Roth,<sup>3</sup> Grassmann,<sup>4</sup> Zimmer,<sup>5</sup> as well
<div n="lb"/>as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn.
<div n="lb"/>Pischel,<sup>6</sup> however, who points out that corn was not ground
<div n="lb"/>between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle ({%dṛṣad%}),
<div n="lb"/>considers that Upala-prakṣiṇī denotes a woman that assisted at
<div n="lb"/>the crushing of Soma ({%cf.%} {@Upara@}). Von Schroeder,<sup>7</sup> who more
<div n="lb"/>correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding
<div n="lb"/>{%upala%} as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then
<div n="lb"/>beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who
<div n="lb"/>fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’

<div n="lb"/>the compound as ‘filling the upper mill-
<div n="lb"/>stone,’ an interpretation which as it

<div n="lb"/>Von Schroeder does not accept the
<div n="lb"/>view that the mother of the singer is
<div n="lb"/>alluded to; but it seems impossible to
<div n="lb"/>draw any other conclusion from the
<div n="lb"/>language of the passage, and his own
<div n="lb"/>explanation of the word as refer-
<div n="lb"/>ring to a corn-mother is very im-
<div n="lb"/>probable; {%cf.%} Keith, {%Journal of the Royal%}
