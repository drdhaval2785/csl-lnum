{@Bhagī-ratha Aikṣvāka@}¦ (‘descendant of {@Ikṣvāku@}’) is the
<div n="lb"/>name of a king in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 6,
<div n="lb"/>1. 2). It is important to note that he is regarded as being on
<div n="lb"/>friendly terms with the {@Kuru-Pañcālas,@} which points to the
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvākus being allied to that people, and not belonging (as is
<div n="lb"/>the case in the Buddhist books) to the east of India.
