{@Pur@}¦ is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>later,<sup>2</sup> meaning ‘rampart,’ ‘fort,’ or ‘stronghold.’ Such fortifi-
<div n="lb"/>cations must have been occasionally of considerable size, as
<div n="lb"/>one is called ‘broad’ ({%pṛthvī%}) and ‘wide’ ({%urvī%}).<sup>3</sup> Elsewhere<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a fort ‘made of stone’ ({%aśmamayī%}) is mentioned. Sometimes
<div n="lb"/>strongholds ‘of iron’ ({%āyasī%}) are referred to,<sup>5</sup> but these are
<div n="lb"/>probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ ({%gomatī%}) is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned,<sup>6</sup> showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle.
<div n="lb"/>‘Autumnal’ ({%śāradī%}) forts are named, apparently as belonging
<div n="lb"/>to the {@Dāsas:@} this may refer to the forts in that season being
[Page1-539+ 89]
<div n="lb"/>occupied against Āryan attacks or against inundations caused
<div n="lb"/>by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ ({%śata-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhuji%}) are spoken of.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as
<div n="lb"/>permanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the
<div n="lb"/>mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge
<div n="lb"/>against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and
<div n="lb"/>a ditch ({%cf.%} {@Dehī@}). Pischel and Geldner,<sup>8</sup> however, think that
<div n="lb"/>there were towns with wooden walls and ditches (<lang n="greek">περίβολος</lang> and
<lang n="greek">τάφρος</lang>) like the Indian town of Pāṭaliputra known to Megas-
<div n="lb"/>thenes<sup>9</sup> and the Pāli texts.<sup>10</sup> This is possible, but hardly
<div n="lb"/>susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the
<div n="lb"/>word {@Nagara@} is of late occurrence. On the whole it is hardly
<div n="lb"/>likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed.
<div n="lb"/>In the Epic, according to Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> there are found the
<div n="lb"/>Nagara, ‘city’; {@Grāma,@} ‘village’; and Ghoṣa, ‘ranch.’ Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with
<div n="lb"/>modifications in its later period.
<div n="P"/>The siege of forts is mentioned in the Saṃhitās and Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas.<sup>12</sup> According to the Rigveda,<sup>13</sup> fire was used.

<div n="lb"/>the palisade was no more than a hedge
<div n="lb"/>of thorn or a row of stakes ({%cf.%} Rv.
<div n="lb"/>x. 101, 8), as suggested by Zimmer,
<div n="lb"/>{%Altindisches Leben,%} 143, 145; and {%cf.%}
<div n="lb"/>Rv. viii. 53, 5, as corrected by Roth,
<div n="lb"/>{%Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Gesellschaft,%} 48, 109.
<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 142-
<div n="lb"/>148, who compares the fact that neither
<div n="lb"/>the Germans (Tacitus, {%Germania,%} 16)
<div n="lb"/>nor the Slavs (Procopius, {%De bello Gotico,%}
<div n="lb"/>iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the
<div n="lb"/>ancient Indians, were scattered in
<div n="lb"/>villages, each consisting of the houses
<div n="lb"/>and steadings of the several families
<div n="lb"/>living in the village. The evidence
<div n="lb"/>seems pretty convincing. It is true
<div n="lb"/>that the Greeks, when we first find
<div n="lb"/>them, evidently knew castles and for-
<div n="lb"/>tresses of the mediæval type; but the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks were clearly an invading race,
<div n="lb"/>superimposed on an older and in
<div n="lb"/>civilization more advanced people (see,
<div n="lb"/>{%e.g.,%} Burrows, {%Discoveries in Crete%}). But
<div n="lb"/>the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have
<div n="lb"/>sometimes been built within the limits
<div n="lb"/>of the village. Whether, as he urges
<div n="lb"/>(144), the {%śāradī pur%} was a protection
<div n="lb"/>against the floods of autumn is un-
<div n="lb"/>certain. {%Cf.%} Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2;
<div n="lb"/>vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not
<div n="lb"/>legitimate to connect the mention of
<div n="lb"/>those forts with the fact that the Pūrus
<div n="lb"/>lived on either side of the Sindhu
<div n="lb"/>(Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's
<div n="lb"/>attack on the aborigines was directed
<div n="lb"/>against the forts in which they normally
<div n="lb"/>protected themselves on the rising of
<div n="lb"/>the river. No argument for the large
<div n="lb"/>size of cities can be drawn from the
<div n="lb"/>mention in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, v. 1,
<div n="lb"/>of {%ekādaśa-dvāra%} as an epithet of Pura
<div n="lb"/>({%cf.%} Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad, iii. 18;
<div n="lb"/>{%nava-dvāra pura,%} ‘the citadel of nine
<div n="lb"/>doors’), because it is used meta-
<div n="lb"/>phorically of the body, and the number
<div n="lb"/>of doors depends on the nature of the
<div n="lb"/>body (Keith, {%Aitareya Āraṇyaka,%} 185).
<div n="lb"/>The evidence of the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to
<div n="lb"/>point to only one gate in a city.
