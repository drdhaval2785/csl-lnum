{@Dur-gaha@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>his grandsons are lauded for their generosity, though Sāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>renders the word adjectivally.<sup>2</sup> In another passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> however, Sāyaṇa sees in the epithet Daurgaha a
<div n="lb"/>description of {@Purukutsa@} as Durgaha's son, who was either
<div n="lb"/>captured by the enemy or slain, and whose wife, {@Purukutsānī,@}
<div n="lb"/>then obtained a son, {@Trasadasyu,@} to restore the line; he also
<div n="lb"/>quotes a story, not found in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> to support this
<div n="lb"/>interpretation. On the other hand, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>seems to take Daurgaha as meaning a horse. Sieg<sup>6</sup> thinks
<div n="lb"/>that the same sense should be adopted in the Rigveda passage,
<div n="lb"/>which he interprets as referring to the sacrifice of a horse,
<div n="lb"/>Daurgaha, by King Purukutsa to gain a son; he also sees in
<div n="lb"/>Dadhikrāvan, with Pischel<sup>7</sup> and Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> a real horse, the
<div n="lb"/>charger of Trasadasyu. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa's inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretation of Daurgaha is, however, doubtful, and cannot be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as receiving support from the case of Dadhikrāvan,
<div n="lb"/>who was probably a divinity, and not a real horse at all.<sup>9</sup>
