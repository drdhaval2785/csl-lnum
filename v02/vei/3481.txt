{@Sabhā-cara@}¦ is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup> The St. Petersburg
[Page2-428+ 33]
<div n="lb"/>Dictionary thinks it is an adjective equivalent in sense to
<div n="lb"/>{%sabhā-ga,%}’ ‘going to the assembly.’ As he is dedicated to
<div n="lb"/>Dharma, ‘Justice,’ it is difficult not to see in him a member of
<div n="lb"/>the Sabhā as a law court, perhaps as one of those who sit
<div n="lb"/>to decide cases: there is nothing to show whether the whole
<div n="lb"/>assembly did so, or only a chosen body. The special use of
<div n="lb"/>Sabhācara suggests the latter alternative. See also {@Sabhāsad.@}
