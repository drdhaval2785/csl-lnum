{@Itihāsa,@}¦ as a kind of literature, is repeatedly mentioned
<div n="lb"/>along with {@Purāṇa@} in the later texts of the Vedic period.
<div n="lb"/>The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book
<div n="lb"/>of the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> Itihāsa then appears in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the Jaiminīya,<sup>3</sup> Bṛhadāraṇyaka,<sup>4</sup> and Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads.<sup>5</sup> In the latter it is expressly declared with Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>to make up the fifth Veda, while the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>makes the Itihāsa a Veda and the Purāṇa a Veda. The
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsa-veda and the Purāṇa-veda appear also in the Gopatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> while the Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> identifies the Itihāsa as well
<div n="lb"/>as the Purāṇa with the Veda. In one passage {@Anvākhyāna@}
<div n="lb"/>and Itihāsa are distinguished<sup>9</sup> as different classes of works, but
<div n="lb"/>the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former
<div n="lb"/>was supplementary. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>10</sup> mentions
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural.
<div n="P"/>There is nothing to show in the older literature what dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinction there was, if any, between Itihāsa and Purāṇa; and
<div n="lb"/>the late literature,<sup>11</sup> which has been elaborately examined by
<div n="lb"/>Sieg,<sup>12</sup> yields no consistent result. Geldner<sup>13</sup> has conjectured
<div n="lb"/>that there existed a single work, the Itihāsa-purāṇa, a collection
[Page1-077+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical;
<div n="lb"/>but though a work called Itihāsa, and another called Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>were probably known to Patañjali,<sup>14</sup> the inaccuracy of Geldner's
<div n="lb"/>view is proved by the fact that Yāska shows no sign of having
<div n="lb"/>known any such work. To him the Itihāsa may be a part of
<div n="lb"/>the Mantra literature itself,<sup>15</sup> Aitihāsikas being merely people
<div n="lb"/>who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others
<div n="lb"/>see myths.<sup>16</sup> The fact, however, that the use of the compound
<div n="lb"/>form is rare, and that Yāska regularly has Itihāsa,<sup>17</sup> not
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsa-purāṇa, is against the theory of there ever having been
<div n="lb"/>one work.
<div n="P"/>The relation of Itihāsa to {@Ākhyāna@} is also uncertain. Sieg<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>considers that the words Itihāsa and Purāṇa referred to the
<div n="lb"/>great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic
<div n="lb"/>legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a
<div n="lb"/>fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus,
<div n="lb"/>Anvākhyānas, {@Anuvyākhyānas,@} and {@Vyākhyānas@} could arise,
<div n="lb"/>and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle,
<div n="lb"/>while an Ākhyāna could also be a part of the Itihāsa-purāṇa.
<div n="lb"/>He also suggests that the word Ākhyāna has special reference
<div n="lb"/>to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg,<sup>19</sup> following Windisch,<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and followed by Geldner,<sup>21</sup> Sieg, and others, has found in the
<div n="lb"/>Ākhyāna form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as
<div n="lb"/>the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of
<div n="lb"/>the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form
<div n="lb"/>was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the
<div n="lb"/>emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and von Schroeder.<sup>23</sup> These scholars, in accordance with
<div n="lb"/>older suggestions of Max Müller<sup>24</sup> and Lévi,<sup>25</sup> see in the
[Page1-078+ 34]
<div n="lb"/>so-called Ākhyāna hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg
<div n="lb"/>finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though
<div n="lb"/>the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas.
<div n="lb"/>Elsewhere<sup>26</sup> it has been suggested that the hymns in question
<div n="lb"/>are merely literary dialogues.
