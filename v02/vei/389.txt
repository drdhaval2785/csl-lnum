{@Urvarā@}¦ is with {@Kṣetra@} the regular expression, from the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (<lang n="greek">ἄρουρα</lang>).
<div n="lb"/>Fertile ({%apnasvatī%}) fields<sup>2</sup> are spoken of as well as waste fields
<div n="lb"/>({%ārtanā%}).<sup>3</sup> Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is
<div n="lb"/>clearly referred to both in the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and in the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda,<sup>5</sup> while allusion is also made to the use of manure.<sup>6</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>fields ({%kṣetra%}) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the
<div n="lb"/>plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in
<div n="lb"/>a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> to her father's field ({%urvarā%}), which
<div n="lb"/>is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal
<div n="lb"/>possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning
<div n="lb"/>fields’ ({%urvarā-sā, urvarā-jit, kṣetra-sā%}),<sup>9</sup> while ‘lord of fields’
<div n="lb"/>used of a god<sup>10</sup> is presumably a transfer of a human epithet
<div n="lb"/>({%urvarā-pati%}). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same
[Page1-100+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>connexion as children,<sup>11</sup> and the conquest of fields ({%kṣetrāṇi%}
<div n="lb"/>{%saṃ-ji%}) is often referred to in the Saṃhitās.<sup>12</sup> Very probably, as
<div n="lb"/>suggested by Pischel,<sup>13</sup> the ploughland was bounded by grass
<div n="lb"/>land (perhaps denoted by {@Khila, Khilya@}) which in all likelihood
<div n="lb"/>would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere.
<div n="lb"/>There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort,<sup>14</sup> nor is
<div n="lb"/>there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property
<div n="lb"/>in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the things given as examples of wealth include
<div n="lb"/>fields and houses ({%āyatanāni%}). The Greek evidence<sup>16</sup> also
<div n="lb"/>points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the
<div n="lb"/>ownership is of course not determined by the expression
<div n="lb"/>‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head
<div n="lb"/>of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can
<div n="lb"/>only be conjectured (see {@Pitṛ@}). Very often a family may have
<div n="lb"/>lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules
<div n="lb"/>about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras.<sup>17</sup> In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> the giving of land as
<div n="lb"/>a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no
<div n="lb"/>doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to
<div n="lb"/>be given away or parted with.<sup>19</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Of course, the rules probably go back
<div n="lb"/>to the earlier period, but how far it is
<div n="lb"/>impossible to say. With the settlement
<div n="lb"/>of the country, however, inheritance of
<div n="lb"/>land and its partition must have become

<div n="lb"/>episode (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 4)
<div n="lb"/>of Manu's division of his property,
<div n="lb"/>from which Nābhānediṣṭha was ex-
<div n="lb"/>cluded, this exclusion is made good by
<div n="lb"/>the son's obtaining cattle ({%paśavaḥ%}). It
<div n="lb"/>is clear that cattle, not land, was the
<div n="lb"/>real foundation of wealth, just as in
<div n="lb"/>Ireland, Italy ({%cf. pecunia%}), Greece, etc.
<div n="lb"/>Cattle could be, and were, used indi-
<div n="lb"/>vidually, but land was not open to a
<div n="lb"/>man's free disposal; no doubt, at any
<div n="lb"/>rate, the consent of the family or the
<div n="lb"/>community might be required, but we
<div n="lb"/>are reduced to reliance on analogy in
<div n="lb"/>view of the silence of the texts. {%Cf.%}
