{@Dhvasra@}¦ is named with {@Puruṣanti@} in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>1</sup> as giving gifts to {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḍha.@} These two,
<div n="lb"/>being kings, could not<sup>2</sup> properly accept gifts which Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>alone could accept, but by becoming authors of a verse of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>3</sup> they qualified themselves to accept them. The verse
<div n="lb"/>mentions the names in the dual as {%Dhvasrayoḥ Puruṣantyoḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘from the two, Dhvasra and Puruṣanti.’<sup>4</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> the names occur in the dual as {%Dhvasre Puruṣantī,%}
<div n="lb"/>a reading which is confirmed by the Nidāna Sūtra.<sup>6</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>former is necessarily a feminine form, though Sāyaṇa, in his
<div n="lb"/>comment on the passage, explains it as really an irregular
<div n="lb"/>masculine. According to Roth,<sup>7</sup> the feminine is a corruption
<div n="lb"/>based on the dual form in the verse of the Rigveda mentioned
<div n="lb"/>above; but the names may be those of women,<sup>8</sup> as Benfey<sup>9</sup>
[Page1-408+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>inclines to believe. Weber<sup>10</sup> suggests that the two were
<div n="lb"/>demons, but this is, as Sieg<sup>11</sup> shows, quite unnecessary.
<div n="lb"/>Dhvasra is no doubt identical with {@Dhvasanti.@}

<div n="lb"/>and that the two, Taranta and Puru-
<div n="lb"/>mīḷha, as they appear in Rv. v. 61,
