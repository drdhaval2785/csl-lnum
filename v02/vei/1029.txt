{@Jartila,@}¦ ‘wild sesamum,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā (v. 4, 3, 2) as an unsuitable sacrificial offering. In
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 1, 1, 3) sesamum seeds are
<div n="lb"/>regarded as combining the qualities of cultivation (viz.,
<div n="lb"/>edibility) with those of wild growth (because they are produced
<div n="lb"/>on unploughed land).
