{@Muṣṭi-han,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Muṣṭi-hatyā,@}<sup>2</sup> in the Rigveda and the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda denote. respectively, the ‘hand to hand fighter’ — that is,
<div n="lb"/>the ordinary warrior as opposed to the charioteer, and the
[Page2-169+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>‘fight’ itself. So also in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> the charioteer
<div n="lb"/>({%rathin%}) is opposed to the foot-soldier ({%patti%}), and in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the chariots are opposed to the troops ({%grāma%}) of the
<div n="lb"/>infantry. The parallel of the Greek and other Āryan races
<div n="lb"/>shows that the Kṣatriyas were the fighters from chariots, while
<div n="lb"/>the ordinary host fought on foot.
