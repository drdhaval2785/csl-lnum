{@Paruṣṇī@}¦ is the name of a river which is mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Nadī-stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’),<sup>1</sup> and in the song of Sudās’
<div n="lb"/>victory over the ten kings,<sup>2</sup> which seems to have been made
<div n="lb"/>decisive by the rise of the river drowning the fugitives.<sup>3</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>these passages and one of the eighth book of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where it is called a ‘great stream’ ({%mahenadi%}), the name is
<div n="lb"/>certainly that of the river later called Ravi (Irāvatī), as recog-
<div n="lb"/>nized by Yāska.<sup>5</sup> Pischel<sup>6</sup> sees a reference to it in two other
<div n="lb"/>passages of the Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> where ‘wool’ ({%ūṛṇā%}) is connected
<div n="lb"/>with the word {%paruṣṇī,%} and the allusion to the river is accepted
<div n="lb"/>by Max Müller<sup>8</sup> and Oldenberg,<sup>9</sup> though they are not fully
<div n="lb"/>agreed as to the exact sense of the passages in question.
<div n="lb"/>Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’
<div n="lb"/>({%parus%}) of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood
<div n="lb"/>by the Nirukta,<sup>5</sup> or from its reeds, as Roth<sup>10</sup> suggests.

<div n="P"/>The mention of the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā in the hymn
<div n="lb"/>celebrating the victory of Sudās has given rise to the conjectures
<div n="lb"/>of Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> that the Yamunā in that hymn is merely another
<div n="lb"/>name for the Paruṣṇī, and of Geldner,<sup>12</sup> that the Paruṣṇī there
<div n="lb"/>is merely a tributary of the Yamunā (Jumna). But neither
<div n="lb"/>interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn
<div n="lb"/>is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two
<div n="lb"/>great victories of Sudās. There is a doubtful reference to the
<div n="lb"/>Paruṣṇī in the Atharvaveda.<sup>13</sup>

<F>3) It is impossible to decide precisely
<div n="lb"/>what part the river played in the battle.
<div n="lb"/>It is usually held that the enemies of
<div n="lb"/>Sudās tried to divert the stream, but
<div n="lb"/>failed, and were drowned in its current.
<div n="lb"/>So Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 11;
<div n="lb"/>Macdonell, {%Sanskrit Literature,%} 154;
<div n="lb"/>Geldner, {%Rigveda, Kommentar,%} 103, holds
<div n="lb"/>that Sudās was caught between two
<div n="lb"/>opposing armies, and had to escape
<div n="lb"/>over the Paruṣṇī, that his enemies
<div n="lb"/>tried to divert it to render him more
<div n="lb"/>accessible to their attack, but failed,
<div n="lb"/>and were overwhelmed in the river.
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%} 52 {%et seq.,%}
<div n="lb"/>may be right in rejecting {%in toto%} the
<div n="lb"/>theory of the attempted diversion of
<div n="lb"/>the waters, though in the {%Journal of the%}
<div n="lb"/>{%American Oriental Society,%} 15, 261 {%et seq.,%}
<div n="lb"/>he accepted the traditional view.</F>
