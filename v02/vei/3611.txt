{@Su-bandhu@}¦ in the hymns of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> is taken by Sāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>to be a proper name; but this is not certain, Roth<sup>2</sup> seeing in
<div n="lb"/>the passages only an ordinary noun meaning ‘a good friend.’
<div n="lb"/>The later tradition<sup>3</sup> explains that Subandhu and his brothers,
<div n="lb"/>called {@Gaupāyanas,@} were priests of {@Asamāti,@} who cast them off
<div n="lb"/>and took two others, {@Kirāta@} and {@Ākuli.@} By these two in
<div n="lb"/>pigeon form Subandhu was caused to swoon, but was revived
<div n="lb"/>by his three brothers, who recited certain hymns.<sup>4</sup>
