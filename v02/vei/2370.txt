{@Maru,@}¦ in the plural, is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as the {%utkara%} (‘mound of earth thrown up’ from the excavation
<div n="lb"/>of the altar<sup>2</sup> ) of {@Kurukṣetra.@} This seems to mean that the
<div n="lb"/>Maru deserts (the later Maru-sthala)<sup>3</sup> were so called because
<div n="lb"/>they stood to the ‘altar,’ Kurukṣetra, in the same relation as
<div n="lb"/>the waste earth of the {%utkara%} to the altar at the sacrifice.
