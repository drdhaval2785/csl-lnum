{@Puro-hita@}¦ (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a
<div n="lb"/>priest in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> The office of Purohita is
<div n="lb"/>called Purohiti<sup>3</sup> and {@Purodhā.@} It is clear that the primary
<div n="lb"/>function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a
<div n="lb"/>king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position
<div n="lb"/>is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Vedic literature.<sup>4</sup> Examples of Purohitas in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda are {@Viśvāmitra@}<sup>5</sup> or {@Vasiṣṭha@}<sup>6</sup> in the service of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Bharata@} king; {@Sudās,@} of the {@Tṛtsu@} family; the Purohita of
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuruśravaṇa;@}<sup>7</sup> and {@Devāpi,@} the Purohita of {@Śantanu.@}<sup>8</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Purohita was in all religious matters the {%alter ego%} of the king.
<div n="lb"/>In the ritual<sup>9</sup> it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the
<div n="lb"/>king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers;<sup>10</sup> he procures
[Page2-006+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>the fall of rain for the crops;<sup>11</sup> he is the flaming fire that
<div n="lb"/>guards the kingdom.<sup>12</sup> Divodāsa in trouble is rescued by
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja;<sup>13</sup> and King {@Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka@}
<div n="lb"/>reproaches his Purohita, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} when his car runs over
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin boy and kills him.<sup>14</sup> The close relation of king and
<div n="lb"/>Purohita is illustrated by the case of {@Kutsa Aurava,@} who slew
<div n="lb"/>his Purohita, {@Upagu Sauśravasa,@} for disloyalty in serving
<div n="lb"/>Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile.<sup>15</sup> Other disputes between
<div n="lb"/>kings and priests who officiated for them are those of {@Janam-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ejaya@} and the {@Kaśyapas,@} and of {@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyā-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@parṇas;@}<sup>16</sup> and between {@Asamāti@} and the {@Gaupāyanas.@}<sup>17</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for
<div n="lb"/>example, {@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} was the Purohita of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kurus@} and the {@Sṛṅjayas@} at the same time,<sup>18</sup> and {@Jala Jātū-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@karṇya@} was the Purohita of the kings of {@Kāśi, Videha,@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Kosala.@}<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was
<div n="lb"/>hereditary in a family, though it probably was so.<sup>20</sup> At any
<div n="lb"/>rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with
<div n="lb"/>King {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} and with his son {@Upamaśravas,@}<sup>21</sup> that a
<div n="lb"/>king would keep on the Purohita of his father.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>22</sup> thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>as shown by the case of King Viśvantara, who sacrificed with-
<div n="lb"/>out the help of the Śyāparṇas,<sup>23</sup> and that a Purohita need not
<div n="lb"/>be a priest, as shown by the case of Devāpi and Śantanu.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that
[Page2-007+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Viśvantara sacrificed without priests, while Devāpi is not
<div n="lb"/>regarded as a king until the Nirukta,<sup>25</sup> and there is no
<div n="lb"/>reason to suppose that Yāska's view expressed in that work
<div n="lb"/>is correct.
<div n="P"/>According to Geldner,<sup>26</sup> the Purohita from the beginning
<div n="lb"/>acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being
<div n="lb"/>there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of
<div n="lb"/>this view, he cites the fact that Vasiṣṭha is mentioned both as
<div n="lb"/>Purohita<sup>27</sup> and as Brahman:<sup>28</sup> at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa@} he
<div n="lb"/>served as Brahman,<sup>29</sup> but he was the Purohita of Sudās;<sup>30</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati is called the Purohita<sup>31</sup> and the Brahman<sup>32</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mans at the sacrifice.<sup>33</sup> It is thus clear that the Brahman was
<div n="lb"/>often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the
<div n="lb"/>case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the
<div n="lb"/>later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice.<sup>34</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the
<div n="lb"/>earlier ritual; Oldenberg<sup>35</sup> seems to be right in holding that
<div n="lb"/>the Purohita was originally the Hotṛ priest, the singer {%par%}
<div n="lb"/>{%excellence,%} when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices with the {@Ṛtvijs.@} So Devāpi seems clearly to have
[Page2-008+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>been a Hotṛ;<sup>36</sup> Agni is at once Purohita<sup>37</sup> and Hotṛ;<sup>38</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also
<div n="lb"/>called the ‘two Purohitas.’<sup>39</sup> Later, no doubt, when the
<div n="lb"/>priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with
<div n="lb"/>his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required
<div n="lb"/>magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priest-
<div n="lb"/>hood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical
<div n="lb"/>times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may
<div n="lb"/>safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public
<div n="lb"/>affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's
<div n="lb"/>conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the
<div n="lb"/>Purohita represents, as Roth<sup>41</sup> and Zimmer<sup>42</sup> thought, the
<div n="lb"/>source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already
<div n="lb"/>in existence in the Rigveda (see {@Varṇa@}).

<F>4) Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 144,
<div n="lb"/>thinks that several Purohitas were
<div n="lb"/>possible, quoting Sāyaṇa, on Rv. x. 57, 1,
<div n="lb"/>who gives the tale of the Gaupāyanas
<div n="lb"/>and King Asamāti from the Śāṭyāya-
<div n="lb"/>naka, and comparing the case of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra as Purohitas,
<div n="lb"/>probably contemporaneously, of Sudās.
<div n="lb"/>But that the two were contemporaneous
<div n="lb"/>is most unlikely, especially if we adopt
<div n="lb"/>the very probable view of Hopkins
<div n="lb"/>({%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
<div n="lb"/>15, 260 {%et seq.%}) that Viśvāmitra was
<div n="lb"/>with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when
<div n="lb"/>they unsuccessfully attacked Sudās.
<div n="lb"/>The other narrative has, as Oldenberg,
<div n="lb"/>{%Religion des Veda,%} 375, n. 3, observes,
<div n="lb"/>a markedly fictitious character; while
<div n="lb"/>every other passage that mentions a
<div n="lb"/>Purohita speaks of him in the singular,
<div n="lb"/>and as there was only one Brahman
<div n="lb"/>priest at the sacrifice, so the Purohita
<div n="lb"/>acted as Brahman.</F>
