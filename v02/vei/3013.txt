{@Vīta-havya@}¦ is the name of a prince who is mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> along with {@Bharadvāja,@} and as a contemporary of
<div n="lb"/>{@Sudās,@}<sup>2</sup> though in both passages it is possible to understand the
[Page2-317+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>word as a mere adjective. In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> Vītahavya
<div n="lb"/>appears as connected with {@Jamadagni@} and {@Asita,@} but it is clear
<div n="lb"/>that the legend there has no value. It is possible, though not
<div n="lb"/>certain, that he was a king of the {@Sṛṇjayas.@}<sup>4</sup> In the Yajurveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> a Vītahavya {@Śrāyasa@} appears as a king: he may be
<div n="lb"/>identical with the Vītahavya of the Rigveda, or belong to the
<div n="lb"/>same line. {%Cf.%} {@Vaitahavya.@}
