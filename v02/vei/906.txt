{@Go-mṛga,@}¦ a species of ox, now called Gayal ({%Bos gavaeus%}), is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup> In the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> it is declared to be neither a wild nor a
<div n="lb"/>tame animal; this presumably means that it was semi-
<div n="lb"/>domesticated, or perhaps that it was both tamed and found
<div n="lb"/>wild. With the name of this animal may be compared the
<div n="lb"/>Mṛga Mahiṣa, which is clearly mentioned as wild in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> See also {@Gayava.@}
