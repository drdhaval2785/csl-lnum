{@Vetasu@}¦ is a name occurring in the singular in two passages
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and once in the plural.<sup>2</sup> It seems that he was
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Indra, but there is no reason to assume that he
<div n="lb"/>was a demon. Zimmer<sup>3</sup> thinks that the Vetasus were probably
<div n="lb"/>the tribe of which {@Daśadyu@} was a member, and that they
<div n="lb"/>defeated the {@Tugras.@} The passages are too obscure to render
<div n="lb"/>any version probable.
