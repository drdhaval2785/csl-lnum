{@Ghoṣā@}¦ is mentioned as a protégée of the Aśvins in two
<div n="lb"/>passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> probably as the recipient of a husband,
<div n="lb"/>who is perhaps referred to in another passage<sup>2</sup> as Arjuna,
<div n="lb"/>though this is not likely. Sāyaṇa finds a reference there to
<div n="lb"/>a skin disease, which is considered in the later tradition of the
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaddevatā<sup>3</sup> to have been the cause of her remaining unwed,
<div n="lb"/>but this view is not tenable. According to Sāyaṇa, her son,
<div n="lb"/>Suhastya, is alluded to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda;<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg,<sup>5</sup> however, here sees a reference to Ghoṣā herself,
<div n="lb"/>while Pischel<sup>6</sup> thinks that the form ({%ghoṣe%}) is not a noun at all,
<div n="lb"/>but verbal.
