{@Uśīnara@}¦ — In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā<sup>1</sup> the Kuru-Pañcālas are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as dwelling together in the ‘Middle Country’ with
<div n="lb"/>the Vaśas and the Uśīnaras. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> also
<div n="lb"/>the Uśīnaras are associated with the Kuru-Pañcālas and Vaśas,
<div n="lb"/>but in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the Uśīnaras and Vaśas are re-
<div n="lb"/>garded as northerners. In the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the people is alluded to
<div n="lb"/>in one passage by reference to their queen, Uśīnarāṇī. Zimmer<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west,
<div n="lb"/>but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based
<div n="lb"/>merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>ascribes one hymn<sup>6</sup> to Śibi Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were
<div n="lb"/>known to Alexander's followers as <lang n="greek">Σίβοι</lang>,<sup>7</sup> living between the
<div n="lb"/>Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way
<div n="lb"/>conclusive, as the Śibis, at any rate in Epic times,<sup>8</sup> occupied
<div n="lb"/>the land to the north of Kurukṣetra, and there is no reason
<div n="lb"/>whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Uśīnaras were
<div n="lb"/>farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’
