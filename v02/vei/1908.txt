{@Pūr-pati,@}¦ ‘lord of the fort,’ occurring only once in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is of somewhat doubtful interpretation. The term-
[Page2-014+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>may denote a regular office,<sup>2</sup> similar to that of the {@Grāmaṇī:@}
<div n="lb"/>the {@Pur@} would then be a permanently occupied settlement.
<div n="lb"/>The expression may, however, merely mean the chief over a
<div n="lb"/>fort when it was actually occupied against hostile attack. The
<div n="lb"/>rarity of the word seems to favour the latter sense.
