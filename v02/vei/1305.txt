{@Dāsa,@}¦ like {@Dasyu,@} sometimes denotes enemies of a demoniac
<div n="lb"/>character in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but in many passages<sup>2</sup> the word
<div n="lb"/>refers to human foes of the Āryans. The Dāsas are described
<div n="lb"/>as having forts ({%puraḥ%}),<sup>3</sup> and their clans ({%viśaḥ%}) are mentioned.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’
<div n="lb"/>({%śaradīḥ%}),<sup>5</sup> may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the
<div n="lb"/>epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn
<div n="lb"/>season. The Dāsa colour ({@Varṇa@})<sup>6</sup> is probably an allusion to
<div n="lb"/>the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned.<sup>7</sup> The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called {%anās,%} ‘nose-
<div n="lb"/>less’(?),<sup>8</sup> and {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} ‘of hostile speech,’<sup>9</sup> and are probably
<div n="lb"/>meant by the phallus-worshippers ({%śiśna-devāḥ,%} ‘whose deity
<div n="lb"/>is a phallus’) of the Rigveda.<sup>10</sup> It is significant that constant
[Page1-357+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva
<div n="lb"/>and Dāsa or Dasyu.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the
<div n="lb"/>word Dāsa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>12</sup> Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt,
<div n="lb"/>the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle
<div n="lb"/>they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would
<div n="lb"/>sometimes also become concubines; thus {@Kavaṣa@} was taunted
<div n="lb"/>with being the son of a female slave ({%dāsyāḥ putraḥ%}) in the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ludwig<sup>15</sup> considers that in some passages<sup>16</sup> Dāsa is applied,
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>17</sup> and Meyer<sup>18</sup> think that Dāsa<sup>19</sup> originally meant
<div n="lb"/>‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of
<div n="lb"/>the Dahae<sup>20</sup> of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a desig-
<div n="lb"/>nation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt<sup>21</sup>
<div n="lb"/>argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together,<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying
[Page1-358+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer
<div n="lb"/>of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and
<div n="lb"/>especially those in which Divodāsa — ‘the heavenly Dāsa’ — plays
<div n="lb"/>an important part,<sup>23</sup> to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this
<div n="lb"/>by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as
<div n="lb"/>quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which
<div n="lb"/>Sudās, the Bharatas, Vasiṣṭha, and Viśvāmitra appear. The
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the
<div n="lb"/>seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely
<div n="lb"/>doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa
<div n="lb"/>should have been a Dāsa, and yet have fought against other
<div n="lb"/>Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Sudās
<div n="lb"/>appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems
<div n="lb"/>unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river {@Sarasvati,@}
<div n="lb"/>which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’
<div n="P"/>The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable,<sup>24</sup> but in
<div n="lb"/>civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever
<div n="lb"/>equal to the invaders.<sup>25</sup> Leading Dāsas were {@Ilībiśa, Cumuri@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Dhuni, Pipru, Varcin, Śambara.@} For names of aboriginal
<div n="lb"/>tribes, see {@Kirāta, Kīkaṭa, Caṇḍāla, Parṇaka, Śiṃyu.@}
