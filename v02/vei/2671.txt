{@Rāja-pitṛ@}¦ is one of the titles given to the king in the rite of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Rājasūya@} (‘royal consecration’) according to the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa (viii. 12, 5; 17, 5). It probably designates the king
<div n="lb"/>as ‘father of a king,’ and indicates the hereditary character of
<div n="lb"/>the monarchy. Possibly the later plan<sup>1</sup> of associating the
<div n="lb"/>king's son in the monarchy prevailed in earlier times also.

<div n="lb"/>a king as father’ is also possible.</F>
