{@Sūrya-nakṣatra@}¦ is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> in a
<div n="lb"/>passage where Sāyaṇa takes it as denoting a {@Nakṣatra,@} which
<div n="lb"/>gives out rays of light like the sun. But the real sense (as the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇva text helps to show) is that the sacrificer may take the
<div n="lb"/>sun for his Nakṣatra — {%i.e.,%} he may neglect the Nakṣatras
<div n="lb"/>altogether and rely on the sun.
