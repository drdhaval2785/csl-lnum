{@Yudhyāmadhi@}¦ is apparently the name of a king who was
<div n="lb"/>defeated by {@Sudās.@} The mention of him occurring only in the
<div n="lb"/>verses added at the end of the hymn celebrating the victory of
<div n="lb"/>Sudās over the ten kings<sup>1</sup> can claim little authenticity as a
<div n="lb"/>notice of Sudās.
