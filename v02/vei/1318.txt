{@Dīrgha-tamas@}¦ (‘long darkness’) {@Māmateya@} (‘son of Mamatā’)
<div n="lb"/>{@Aucathya@} (‘son of Ucatha’) is mentioned as a singer in one
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and is referred to in several passages<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>by his metronymic, Māmateya, alone. He is said, both in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,<sup>3</sup> to have attained
<div n="lb"/>the tenth decade of life. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> he
<div n="lb"/>appears as the priest of {@Bharata.@} The Bṛhaddevatā<sup>5</sup> contains
<div n="lb"/>a preposterous legend made up of fragments of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>according to which Dīrghatamas was born blind, but recovered
<div n="lb"/>his sight; in old age he was thrown into a river by his servants,
<div n="lb"/>one of whom, {@Traitana,@} attacked him, but killed himself
<div n="lb"/>instead. Carried down by the stream, he was cast up in the
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga country, where he married Uśij, a slave girl, and begot
<div n="lb"/>{@Kakṣīvant.@} The two legends here combined are not even con-
<div n="lb"/>sistent, for the second ignores Dīrghatamas' recovery of sight.
<div n="lb"/>To attach any historical importance to them, as does Pargiter,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>would seem to be unwise.
