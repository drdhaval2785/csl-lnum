{@Grāma.@}¦ — The primitive sense of this word, which occurs
<div n="lb"/>frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, appears to have been
<div n="lb"/>‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which
<div n="lb"/>were scattered over the country, some close together,<sup>2</sup> some far
<div n="lb"/>apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>3</sup> The village is regularly
<div n="lb"/>contrasted with the forest ({%araṇya%}), and its animals and plants
<div n="lb"/>with those that lived or grew wild in the woods.<sup>4</sup> The villages
<div n="lb"/>contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as
<div n="lb"/>men.<sup>5</sup> Grain was also stored in them.<sup>6</sup> In the evening the
<div n="lb"/>cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.<sup>7</sup> The villages
<div n="lb"/>were probably open, though perhaps a fort ({@Pur@}) might on
[Page1-245+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>occasion be built inside.<sup>8</sup> Presumably they consisted of
<div n="lb"/>detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic literature. Large villages ({%mahāgrāmāḥ%}) were known.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with
<div n="lb"/>precision. In several passages<sup>10</sup> the word occurs with what
<div n="lb"/>appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This
<div n="lb"/>sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote
<div n="lb"/>the ‘village folk,’ as when {@Śaryāta Mānava@} is said in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> to have wandered about with his
<div n="lb"/>‘village’ ({%grāmeṇa%}); but, as Zimmer<sup>12</sup> observes, this restricted
<div n="lb"/>sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda,<sup>13</sup> where indeed
<div n="lb"/>the ‘folk’ ({%jana%})<sup>14</sup> of the Bharatas is in one passage<sup>15</sup> called
<div n="lb"/>the ‘horde seeking cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}). Zimmer<sup>16</sup> tends to
<div n="lb"/>regard the Grāma as a clan, and as standing midway between
<div n="lb"/>the family and the tribe ({@Viś@}). The Grāma may, however,
<div n="lb"/>perhaps be regarded more correctly<sup>17</sup> as an aggregate of several
<div n="lb"/>families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
<div n="lb"/>({@Viś@}), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy
<div n="lb"/>of the village. There is nothing to show that the community
<div n="lb"/>as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that
<div n="lb"/>individual tenure of land was known (see {@Urvarā, Kṣetra@}), but
<div n="lb"/>this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a
<div n="lb"/>family rather than by an individual person. The expression
[Page1-246+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>‘desirous of a village’ ({%grāma-kāma%}), which occurs frequently in
<div n="lb"/>the later Saṃhitās,<sup>19</sup> points, however, to the practice of the king's
<div n="lb"/>granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so
<div n="lb"/>far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later<sup>20</sup> the idea developed
<div n="lb"/>that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that
<div n="lb"/>idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords.
<div n="lb"/>But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond
<div n="lb"/>the word {%grāma-kāma,%} which much more probably refers to the
<div n="lb"/>grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels
<div n="lb"/>show.<sup>21</sup> Such grants probably tended to depress the position
<div n="lb"/>of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but
<div n="lb"/>they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent
<div n="lb"/>in early times.
<div n="P"/>The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal
<div n="lb"/>purposes in early days,<sup>22</sup> and it can hardly be said to have been
<div n="lb"/>a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its
<div n="lb"/>members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and
<div n="lb"/>also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest
<div n="lb"/>in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land,
<div n="lb"/>such as chariot-makers ({@Ratha-kāra@}), carpenters ({@Takṣan@}),
<div n="lb"/>smiths ({@Karmāra@}), and others, but they did not presumably, in
<div n="lb"/>any sense, form part of the brotherhood.<sup>23</sup> All alike were
<div n="lb"/>politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or
<div n="lb"/>service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to
[Page1-247+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often
<div n="lb"/>the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village
<div n="lb"/>is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the head of the village was the Grāma-ṇī, or ‘leader of
<div n="lb"/>the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> and often in
<div n="lb"/>the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>26</sup> The exact
<div n="lb"/>meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer<sup>27</sup> the Grāmaṇī
<div n="lb"/>is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is
<div n="lb"/>certainly often connected with the {@Senānī,@} or ‘leader of an
<div n="lb"/>army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: pre-
<div n="lb"/>sumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil
<div n="lb"/>purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as inferior to the {@Sūta,@} or ‘charioteer,’
<div n="lb"/>with whom, however, he is associated<sup>29</sup> as one of the {@Ratnins,@}
<div n="lb"/>the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially
<div n="lb"/>valuable to a Vaiśya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit
<div n="lb"/>of prosperity ({%gataśrī%}).<sup>30</sup> The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the
<div n="lb"/>royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of
<div n="lb"/>the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post
<div n="lb"/>may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nomi-
<div n="lb"/>nated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available.
<div n="lb"/>The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the
<div n="lb"/>Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was
<div n="lb"/>situated was specially honoured and influential.<sup>31</sup>
