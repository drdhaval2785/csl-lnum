{@Gardabha,@}¦ ‘the ass,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as inferior
<div n="lb"/>to the horse. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā he again appears as
<div n="lb"/>inferior to the horse,<sup>2</sup> but at the same time as the best bearer
<div n="lb"/>of burdens ({%bhāra-bhāritama%}) among animals.<sup>3</sup> The same
<div n="lb"/>authority styles the ass {%dvi-retas,%} ‘having double seed,’<sup>4</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>allusion to his breeding with the mare as well as the she-ass.
<div n="lb"/>The smallness of the young of the ass, and his capacity for
<div n="lb"/>eating, are both referred to.<sup>5</sup> The disagreeable cry of the
<div n="lb"/>animal is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,<sup>6</sup> and in allusion to
<div n="lb"/>this the term ‘ass’ is applied opprobriously to a singer in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> A hundred asses are spoken of as a gift to a singer
<div n="lb"/>in a Vālakhilya hymn.<sup>8</sup> The mule ({%aśvatara%}) is the offspring of
<div n="lb"/>an ass and a mare, the latter, like the ass, being called {%dvi-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%retas,%}<sup>9</sup> ‘receiving double seed,’ for similar reasons. The male
<div n="lb"/>ass is often also termed {@Rāsabha.@} The female ass, Gardabhī,
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad.<sup>11</sup>
