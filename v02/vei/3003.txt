{@Viṣṭhā-vrājin@}¦ is a word of doubtful significance in the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> According to Sāyaṇa, it means ‘remaining
<div n="lb"/>in one and the same place’; if this is right, the rendering of the
[Page2-315+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>St. Petersburg Dictionary and of Böhtlingk's Dictionary, ‘one
<div n="lb"/>whose herd is stationary,’ seems legitimate. But, as Eggeling<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>points out, the Kāṇva recension of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in
<div n="lb"/>another passage<sup>3</sup> seems to treat the word as denoting a disease:
<div n="lb"/>thus Viṣṭhāvrājin may mean ‘one afflicted by dysentery.’
