{@Turvaśa@}¦ occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of
<div n="lb"/>a man or of a people, usually in connexion with {@Yadu.@} The
<div n="lb"/>two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting
<div n="lb"/>particle, {%Turvaśa Yadu%} or {%Yadu Turvaśa.%}<sup>2</sup> In a plural form
<div n="lb"/>the name Turvaśa occurs once with the Yadus,<sup>3</sup> and once
<div n="lb"/>alone<sup>4</sup> in a hymn in which the singular has already been used.
<div n="lb"/>In one passage<sup>5</sup> the dual {%Turvaśā-Yadū%} actually occurs, and
<div n="lb"/>in another<sup>6</sup> {%Yadus Turvaś ca,%} ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other
<div n="lb"/>passages<sup>7</sup> Turvaśa appears alone, while in one<sup>8</sup> Turvaśa and
<div n="lb"/>Yādva occur.
<div n="P"/>From these facts Hopkins<sup>9</sup> deduces the erroneousness of the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary view,<sup>10</sup> according to which Turvaśa is the name of
<div n="lb"/>a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is
<div n="lb"/>not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument
<div n="lb"/>based on the theory<sup>11</sup> that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>are the {@Anus, Druhyus,@} Turvaśas, Yadus, and {@Pūrus,@} it is
<div n="lb"/>perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were
<div n="lb"/>two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently
<div n="lb"/>were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the
<div n="lb"/>{%Turvaśā-Yadū%} and speak of {%Yadus Turvaś ca.%} This explanation
<div n="lb"/>also suits best the use of the plural of Turvaśa in two Rigvedic
<div n="lb"/>hymns.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvaśa was his partici-
<div n="lb"/>pation in the war against {@Sudās,@} by whom he was defeated.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins<sup>13</sup> suggests that he may have been named Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>because of his fleet ({%tura%}) escape from the battle. His escape
<div n="P"/>1 i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; vi. 20,
<div n="lb"/>12; 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14;
<div n="lb"/>45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>is joined with Yakṣu, apparently a con-
<div n="lb"/>temptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins,
<div n="lb"/>{%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
<div n="lb"/>15, 261). {%Cf.%} {@Tṛtsu.@}
[Page1-316+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages<sup>14</sup> Indra's
<div n="lb"/>aid to Turvaśa (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant
<div n="lb"/>that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>and Yadu kings, and that Turvaśa appears in the eighth book
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince,
<div n="lb"/>the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Griffith,<sup>16</sup> however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat
<div n="lb"/>by Turvaśa and Yadu of Arṇa and Citraratha on the {@Sarayu;@}<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but the evidence for this is quite inadequate.
<div n="P"/>Two passages of the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> seem to refer to an attack by
<div n="lb"/>Turvaśa and Yadu on {@Divodāsa,@} the father of Sudās. It is
<div n="lb"/>reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two
<div n="lb"/>peoples on Divodāsa, for there is some improbability of the
<div n="lb"/>references being to the Turvaśa, who was concerned in the
<div n="lb"/>attack on Sudās, the son.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>19</sup> considers that the Turvaśas were also called {@Vṛcī-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@vants.@} This view is based on a hymn<sup>20</sup> in which reference
<div n="lb"/>is made to the defeat of the Vṛcīvants on the {@Yavyāvatī@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Hariyūpīyā@} in aid of Daivarāta, and of Turvaśa in aid of
<div n="lb"/>{@Sṛñjaya,@} the latter being elsewhere<sup>21</sup> clearly the son of Deva-
<div n="lb"/>rāta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas
<div n="lb"/>with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient<sup>22</sup> to assume
<div n="lb"/>that they were allies.
<div n="P"/>Later, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>23</sup> the Turvaśas appear
<div n="lb"/>as allies of the Pañcālas, Taurvaśa horses, thirty-three in
<div n="lb"/>number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being
<div n="lb"/>mentioned.<sup>24</sup> But otherwise the name disappears: this lends
[Page1-317+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>probability to Oldenberge's conjecture<sup>25</sup> that the Turvaśas
<div n="lb"/>became merged in the {@Pañcāla@} people. Hopkins<sup>26</sup> considers
<div n="lb"/>that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named
<div n="lb"/>from the family of Turvaśa; but this view is less likely, since
<div n="lb"/>it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the
<div n="lb"/>Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with Sudās. They
<div n="lb"/>apparently crossed the {@Paruṣṇī,@}<sup>27</sup> but from which side is dis-
<div n="lb"/>puted. The view of Pischel<sup>28</sup> and Geldner,<sup>29</sup> that they advanced
<div n="lb"/>from the west towards the east, where the {@Bharatas@} were (see
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuru@}), is the more probable.
