{@Avata,@}¦ a word occurring several times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> denotes
<div n="lb"/>a well, artificially made ({%khan%} ‘to dig’) in contrast with a spring
[Page1-040+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>({%utsa%}), though the latter expression is also applied to an artificial
<div n="lb"/>well. Such wells were covered by the makers,<sup>2</sup> and are described
<div n="lb"/>as unfailing ({%a-kṣita%}) and full of water.<sup>3</sup> The water was raised
<div n="lb"/>by a wheel ({%cakra%}) of stone, to which was fastened a strap
<div n="lb"/>({%varatrā%}), with a pail ({%kośa%})<sup>4</sup> attached to it. When raised it was
<div n="lb"/>poured ({%siñc%}) into buckets ({%āhāva%}) of wood.<sup>5</sup> Sometimes those
<div n="lb"/>wells appear to have been used for irrigation purposes, the water
<div n="lb"/>being led off into broad channels ({%sārmī suṣirā%}).<sup>6</sup>
