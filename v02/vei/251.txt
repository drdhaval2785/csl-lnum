{@Ā-yudha,@}¦ ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole
<div n="lb"/>of a Kṣatriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> is summed up as horse-chariot ({%aśva-ratha%}), bow
<div n="lb"/>and arrows ({%iṣu-dhanva%}), and corselet ({%kavaca%}). As the bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrow ({%iṣu, dhanvan%}) were essential as the main weapons of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when Āyudha is
<div n="lb"/>used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> confirms this
<div n="lb"/>view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour ({@Varman@}), with a
<div n="lb"/>guard ({@Hastaghna@}) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the
<div n="lb"/>bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal,
<div n="lb"/>but consisted of many pieces fitted together ({%syūta%});<sup>4</sup> it may
[Page1-061+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of
<div n="lb"/>some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior
<div n="lb"/>wore a helmet ({@Śiprā@}). There is no trace of the use of a
<div n="lb"/>shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of
<div n="lb"/>greaves or other guard for the feet.<sup>5</sup> Skill in the use of weapons
<div n="lb"/>is referred to in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether sling stones ({@Adri, Aśani@}) were in
<div n="lb"/>ordinary use. The hook ({%aṅkuśa%})<sup>7</sup> also is merely a divine
<div n="lb"/>weapon, and the axe ({%svadhiti,%}<sup>8</sup> {%vāśī, paraśu%}) does not occur in
<div n="lb"/>mortal combats. For the use of the spear see {@Ṛṣṭi, Rambhiṇī,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Śakti, Śaru;@} of the sword, {@Asi, Kṛti.@} Neither weapon can be
<div n="lb"/>considered ordinary in warfare, nor was the club ({@Vajra@}) used.
<div n="lb"/>For the modes of warfare see {@Saṃgrāma.@}
