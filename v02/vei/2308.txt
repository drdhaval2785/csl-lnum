{@Bhrātṛvya@}¦ is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an
<div n="lb"/>expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's)
<div n="lb"/>brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’<sup>2</sup> this meaning alone accounting for the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily
<div n="lb"/>develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may,
<div n="lb"/>however, have been ‘nephew,’<sup>5</sup> as the simple etymological
<div n="lb"/>sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account
<div n="lb"/>for the later meaning so well. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> pre-
<div n="lb"/>scribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhrātṛvya, who, further,
<div n="lb"/>is often given the epithets ‘hating’ ({%dviṣan%}) and ‘evil’ ({%apriya,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%pāpman%}) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>7</sup> The Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>8</sup> also contains various spells, which aim at destroying or
<div n="lb"/>expelling one's ‘rivals.’
<F>1) v. 22, 12, and perhaps x. 3, 9.</F>
<F>2) The word is rendered ‘cousin’ by
<div n="lb"/>Whitney in his Translation of the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda (x. 6, 1; xv. 1, 8).</F>
<F>3) ii. 18, 1; viii. 10, 18. 33; x. 9, 1.</F>
<F>4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 9, 2,
<div n="lb"/>etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 7; xxvii. 8;
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 17; Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, etc.; Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, i. 1, 1, 21, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, xii. 13, 2. {%Cf.%} Rv. viii. 21,
<div n="lb"/>13.</F>
<F>5) Whitney, in his Translation of the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda (ii. 18, 1), while rendering
<div n="lb"/>the word by ‘adversary,’ explains it in
<div n="lb"/>a note as meaning literally ‘nephew,’
<div n="lb"/>or ‘brother's son.’</F>
<F>6) xxvii. 8.</F>

<div n="lb"/>in n. 4.</F>
