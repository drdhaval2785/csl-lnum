{@Kula, Kula-pā.@}¦ — As an uncompounded word, Kula does not
<div n="lb"/>occur before the period of the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> It denotes the
<div n="lb"/>‘home’ or ‘house of the family,’ and by metonymy the family
<div n="lb"/>itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pā (lit. ‘house
<div n="lb"/>protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as inferior to and attendant on the {@Vrājapati@} in war, the latter
<div n="lb"/>being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan.
<div n="lb"/>In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> a girl is ironically called Kulapā, because
<div n="lb"/>she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama
<div n="lb"/>(the god of death) for a spouse.
<div n="P"/>The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of
<div n="lb"/>individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members
<div n="lb"/>under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula
<div n="lb"/>the dwelling is. As distinct from {@Gotra,@} Kula seems to mean
<div n="lb"/>the family in the narrower sense of the members who still
<div n="lb"/>live in one house, the undivided family. {%Cf.%} {@Gṛha, Grāma,@}
