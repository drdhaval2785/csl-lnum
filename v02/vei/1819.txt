{@Pitṛ,@}¦ common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’
<div n="lb"/>not so much as the ‘begetter’ ({%janitṛ%}),<sup>1</sup> but rather as the pro-
<div n="lb"/>tector of the child, this being probably also the etymological
<div n="lb"/>sense of the word.<sup>2</sup> The father in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> stands for all
<div n="lb"/>that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>while Indra is even dearer than a father.<sup>5</sup> The father carries
<div n="lb"/>his son in his arms,<sup>6</sup> and places him on his lap,<sup>7</sup> while the child
<div n="lb"/>pulls his garment to attract attention.<sup>8</sup> In later years the son
<div n="lb"/>depends on his father for help in trouble,<sup>9</sup> and greets him
<div n="lb"/>with joy.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was
<div n="lb"/>subject to parental control, and how long such control con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued. Reference is made in the Rigveda<sup>11</sup> to a father's
<div n="lb"/>chastising his son for gambling, and {@Ṛjrāśva@} is said to have
<div n="lb"/>been blinded by his father.<sup>12</sup> From the latter statement
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>13</sup> infers the existence of a developed {%patria potestas,%} but
<div n="lb"/>to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would
<div n="lb"/>be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the {%patria potestas%}
<div n="lb"/>was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis
<div n="lb"/>in the Roman {%patria potestas.%} If there is no proof that a father
[Page1-527+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>legally controlled his son's wedding,<sup>14</sup> and not much that he
<div n="lb"/>controlled his daughter's,<sup>15</sup> the fact is in itself not im-
<div n="lb"/>probable.
<div n="P"/>There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when
<div n="lb"/>grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife
<div n="lb"/>becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he
<div n="lb"/>set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor
<div n="lb"/>do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land
<div n="lb"/>on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such
<div n="lb"/>property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate
<div n="lb"/>of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor
<div n="lb"/>and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact
<div n="lb"/>that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property,<sup>16</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or he might divide it amongst them,<sup>17</sup> and that when the
<div n="lb"/>father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's
<div n="lb"/>wife.<sup>18</sup> There are also obscure traces that in old age a father
<div n="lb"/>might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that
<div n="lb"/>this was usual in Vedic India.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he
<div n="lb"/>owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his
<div n="lb"/>father's food.<sup>21</sup> On the other hand, the father was expected
<div n="lb"/>to be kind. The story of {@Śunaḥśepa@} in the Aitareya Brāh-
[Page1-528+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>22</sup> emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless
<div n="lb"/>treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads<sup>23</sup> insist on the
<div n="lb"/>spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son<sup>24</sup>
<div n="lb"/>was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature
<div n="lb"/>years.
<div n="P"/>On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible.<sup>25</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but
<div n="lb"/>when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a
<div n="lb"/>person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's
<div n="lb"/>adoption of Śunaḥśepa.<sup>26</sup> It is not clear that adoption from
<div n="lb"/>one caste into another was possible, for there is no good
<div n="lb"/>evidence that Viśvāmitra was, as Weber<sup>27</sup> holds, a Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>who adopted a Brāhmaṇa. Adoption was also not always in
<div n="lb"/>high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha book of the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> condemns the usage. It was
<div n="lb"/>also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons,
<div n="lb"/>to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice
<div n="lb"/>appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda<sup>29</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as interpreted by Yāska.<sup>30</sup> Moreover, it is possible that the
<div n="lb"/>difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband<sup>31</sup> may have
<div n="lb"/>been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to
<div n="lb"/>make her a Putrikā, the later technical name for a daughter
<div n="lb"/>whose son is to belong to her father's family.
<div n="P"/>There can be no doubt that in a family the father took
<div n="lb"/>precedence of the mother.<sup>32</sup> Delbrück<sup>33</sup> explains away the
<div n="lb"/>apparent cases to the contrary.<sup>34</sup> There is no trace of the
[Page1-529+ 74]
<div n="lb"/>family as a land-owning corporation.<sup>35</sup> The dual form Pitarau
<div n="lb"/>regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’<sup>36</sup>

<div n="lb"/>But, as Böhtlingk and Roth, St. Peters-

<F>35) Baden Powell, whose various
<div n="lb"/>works ({%Indian Village Community,%} 1896;
<div n="lb"/>{%Village Communities in India,%} 1899, etc.)
<div n="lb"/>have done most to combat the view of
<div n="lb"/>the village community in India as a
<div n="lb"/>land-holding institution, is prepared to
<div n="lb"/>recognize the family as a land-owning
<div n="lb"/>unit, considering that the {%patria potestas%}
<div n="lb"/>is a later growth, and not Indian (see,
<div n="lb"/>{%e.g., Village Communities in India,%} 128
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}). Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%}
<div n="lb"/>218 {%et seq.,%} adopts a theory which allows
<div n="lb"/>of individual and joint family owner-
<div n="lb"/>ship side by side, the latter being
<div n="lb"/>apparently the earlier but the decadent
<div n="lb"/>stage. He expressly considers (p. 222)
<div n="lb"/>that the son had an indefeasible right to
<div n="lb"/>prevent the father from alienating the
<div n="lb"/>hereditary land, which could only be
<div n="lb"/>parted with by the consent of the village
<div n="lb"/>if it were a case of joint ownership
<div n="lb"/>({%cf.%} the verse cited by Jolly, {%Recht und%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Sitte,%} 94). But it must be remembered
<div n="lb"/>that, as is very clearly shown in the
<div n="lb"/>case of English law by Pollock and
<div n="lb"/>Maitland ({%History of English Law,%} 2,
<div n="lb"/>337-352), the recognition of the rights
<div n="lb"/>of sons may well be, not a sign of
<div n="lb"/>original joint or family ownership, but
<div n="lb"/>a development from the existence of
<div n="lb"/>intestate succession, and as in England,
<div n="lb"/>so in India, there is no trace of a
<div n="lb"/>corporate joint family in the early
<div n="lb"/>books. And, as Jolly ({%op. cit.,%} 76, 80)
<div n="lb"/>shows, there are clear traces, both in
<div n="lb"/>old and modern times, of a despotic
<div n="lb"/>control of the family by the father even
<div n="lb"/>after his sons grew up, provided only
<div n="lb"/>that he was physically able to control
<div n="lb"/>them. The same state of affairs seems
<div n="lb"/>proved for early English law, as it is
<div n="lb"/>beyond question for Roman law (see
<div n="lb"/>Smith's {%Dictionary of Antiquities,%} 2, 351
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}). In Greece also, which is some-
<div n="lb"/>times contrasted with Rome, there is
<div n="lb"/>the clearest trace of both a real {%patria%}
<div n="lb"/>{%potestas,%} and of the absolute ownership
<div n="lb"/>of the land by the father as against
<div n="lb"/>the son, especially in the archaic laws
<div n="lb"/>of Gortyn (see Gardner and Jevons,
<div n="lb"/>{%Greek Antiquities,%} 404, 405, 563, 566).</F>
