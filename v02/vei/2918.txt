{@Vāsas@}¦ is the most usual word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for
<div n="lb"/>‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool ({%cf.%}
<div n="lb"/>{@Ūrṇā@}); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ ({%vāse-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vāya%})<sup>3</sup> because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms.
<div n="lb"/>The garments worn were often embroidered ({%cf.%} {@Peśas@}), and
<div n="lb"/>the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with
<div n="lb"/>gold.<sup>4</sup> When the ‘giver of garments’ ({%vāso-dā%})<sup>5</sup> is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are
<div n="lb"/>probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas-
[Page2-292+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>thenes for his day.<sup>7</sup> The Rigveda also presents epithets like
<div n="lb"/>{%su-vasana%}<sup>8</sup> and {%su-rabhi,%}<sup>9</sup> implying that garments were becoming
<div n="lb"/>or well-fitting.
<div n="P"/>The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments
<div n="lb"/>-an undergarment ({%cf.%} {@Nīvi@}),<sup>10</sup> a garment,<sup>11</sup> and an over-
<div n="lb"/>garment ({%cf.%} {@Adhīvāsa@}),<sup>12</sup> which was presumably a mantle, and
<div n="lb"/>for which the names {@Atka@} and {@Drāpi@} also seem to be used.
<div n="lb"/>This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments
<div n="lb"/>given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> which comprise a {@Tārpya,@}
<div n="lb"/>perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of
<div n="lb"/>undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban,
<div n="lb"/>after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and
<div n="lb"/>tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord
<div n="lb"/>with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a
<div n="lb"/>special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the
<div n="lb"/>case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup> There is nothing to show
<div n="lb"/>exactly what differences there were between male and female
<div n="lb"/>costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in
<div n="lb"/>either case.
<div n="P"/>It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently
<div n="lb"/>assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis
<div n="lb"/>would wear clothing of some sort.<sup>16</sup>
