{@Tri-śaṅku@}¦ is in Vedic literature the name of a sage men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned as a teacher in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> There is no
<div n="lb"/>trace of the later legend by which he becomes the victim of
<div n="lb"/>{@Vasiṣṭha's@} curse and the object of {@Viśvāmitra's@} solicitude,
<div n="lb"/>being eventually fixed in the sky as a constellation.<sup>2</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>confusion of the chronology in the tales of Triśaṅku is a good
<div n="lb"/>example of the worthlessness of the supposed epic tradition.
