{@Rasā@}¦ is found in three passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> clearly as the
<div n="lb"/>name of a real stream in the extreme north-west of the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>territory. Elsewhere<sup>2</sup> it is the name of a mythic stream at
<div n="lb"/>the ends of the earth, which as well as the atmosphere it
<div n="lb"/>encompasses. It is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Sarasvatī,@} the literal is the older sense, and to see in the
<div n="lb"/>river a genuine stream, perhaps originally the Araxes or
<div n="lb"/>Jaxartes, because the Vendidad mentions the Raṅhā, the
<div n="lb"/>Avestan form of Rasā. But the word seems originally to allude
<div n="lb"/>merely to the ‘sap’ or ‘flavour’ of the waters,<sup>3</sup> and so could be
<div n="lb"/>applied to every river, like Sarasvatī.
<F>1) i. 112, 12; v. 53, 9; x. 75, 6. In
<div n="lb"/>v. 53, 9, the phrase {%rasānitabhā%} is found.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3,
<div n="lb"/>202, is inclined to regard {%anitabhā%} as an
<div n="lb"/>epithet of Rasā, perhaps for {%amitabhā,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘of unmeasured splendour,’ but this is
<div n="lb"/>hardly probable. It seems better to
<div n="lb"/>take Anitabhā as the name of an other-
<div n="lb"/>wise unknown river. {%Cf.%} Max Müller,
