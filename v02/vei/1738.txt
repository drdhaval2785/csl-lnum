{@Palli-gupta Lauhitya@}¦ (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in a Vaṃśa (‘list of teachers’) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of {@Śyāmajayanta Lauhitya.@}
[Page1-507+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>The name is obviously a late one, for Palli is not found in the
<div n="lb"/>early literature, and the name of the Lauhitya family is other-
<div n="lb"/>wise known in post-Vedic works only.
