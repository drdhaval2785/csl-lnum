<div n="lb"/>Tilak<sup>3</sup> considers that the Devayāna corresponds with the
<div n="lb"/>Uttarāyaṇa, ‘northern journey’ of the sun, and the Pitṛyāṇa
<div n="lb"/>with the Dakṣiṇāyana, its ‘southern journey.’ He concludes
<div n="lb"/>from a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> where three of
<div n="lb"/>the seasons — spring, summer, and the rains — are ascribed to
<div n="lb"/>the gods, but the others to the Pitṛs, or Fathers, that the
<div n="lb"/>Devayāna began with the vernal equinox, and the Pitṛyāṇa
<div n="lb"/>with the autumnal equinox. With this he connects the curious

<div n="lb"/>distinction of Deva- and Yama-Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> These conclusions are, however, very improbable.
