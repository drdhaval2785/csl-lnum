{@Abhi-praśnin.@}¦ — This term occurs after {@Praśnin,@} and followed
<div n="lb"/>by {@Praśnavivāka@} in the list of victims for the Puruṣamedha
<div n="lb"/>given in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The commentators, Sāyaṇa and Mahīdhara, see in it merely a
<div n="lb"/>reference to an inquisitive man. But there can be little doubt
<div n="lb"/>that the term must have had a legal reference of some sort — 
<div n="lb"/>perhaps indicating the defendant as opposed to plaintiff and
<div n="lb"/>judge.
