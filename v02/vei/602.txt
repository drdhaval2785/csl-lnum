{@Kāśi, Kāśya.@}¦ — The name Kāśi denotes (in the plural<sup>1</sup>) the
<div n="lb"/>people of Kāśi (Benares), and Kāśya, the king of Kāśi. The
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> tells of {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra,@} king of Kāśi, who
<div n="lb"/>was defeated by {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} with the result that the
<div n="lb"/>Kāśis, down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa, gave up the kindling
<div n="lb"/>of the sacred fire. Sātrājita was a {@Bharata.@} We hear also of
<div n="lb"/>{@Ajātaśatru@} as a king of Kāśi;<sup>3</sup> and no doubt {@Bhadrasena@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Ajātaśatrava,@} a contemporary of {@Uddālaka,@} was also a king of
<div n="lb"/>Kāśi.
<div n="P"/>The Kāśis and {@Videhas@} were closely connected, as was
<div n="lb"/>natural in view of their geographical position. The compound
<div n="lb"/>name Kāśi-Videha occurs in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>4</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>5</sup> {@Gārgī@} describes Ajātaśatru as either
<div n="lb"/>a Kāśi or a Videha king. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
[Page1-154+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Kāśi, Kosala,
<div n="lb"/>and Videha; and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>7</sup> mentions Kāśi
<div n="lb"/>and Videha in close proximity. Weber,<sup>8</sup> indeed, throws out
<div n="lb"/>the suggestion that the Kāśis and the Videhas together con-
<div n="lb"/>stitute the {@Uśīnaras,@} whose name is very rare in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature.
<div n="P"/>As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Kāśi and
<div n="lb"/>Kosala are found combined in the compound name Kāśi-
<div n="lb"/>Kauśalyas of the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though Kāśi is a late word, it is quite possible that the town
<div n="lb"/>is older, as the river {@Varaṇāvatī@} referred to in the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>10</sup> may be connected with the later Vārāṇasī (Benares).
<div n="P"/>It is significant that while the Kāśis, Kosalas, and Videhas
<div n="lb"/>were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pañcala peoples
<div n="lb"/>may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion
<div n="lb"/>that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist
<div n="lb"/>some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture
<div n="lb"/>in some degree. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> in the story of the
<div n="lb"/>advance of Āryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves
<div n="lb"/>a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in
<div n="lb"/>the Kuru-Pañcāla country lay the real centre of the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>culture (see also {@Kuru-Pañcāla@}). That the Kosala-Videhas
<div n="lb"/>were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas
<div n="lb"/>is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the
<div n="lb"/>true Brāhmaṇa culture appears to have been brought to them
<div n="lb"/>from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the
<div n="lb"/>East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less
<div n="lb"/>completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the
<div n="lb"/>movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="lb"/>With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts<sup>13</sup> display
[Page1-155+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which
<div n="lb"/>may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy,
<div n="lb"/>and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>14</sup> It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas
<div n="lb"/>and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later
<div n="lb"/>known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of
<div n="lb"/>distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost
<div n="lb"/>their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears
<div n="lb"/>less likely, though it might be supported by a literal inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup>
