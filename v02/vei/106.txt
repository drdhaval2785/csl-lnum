{@Abhy-agni Aitaśāyana.@}¦ — This man was, according to the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> unfortunate enough to quarrel with his
<div n="lb"/>father, {@Aitaśa.@} The result was that he and his progeny were
<div n="lb"/>called the worst of the {@Aurvas.@} In the version of the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the {@Aitaśāyana Ājāneyas@} take the place of the
<div n="lb"/>Abhyagnis and the {@Bhṛgus@} of the {@Aurvas,@} the latter being
<div n="lb"/>probably a branch of the former family.
