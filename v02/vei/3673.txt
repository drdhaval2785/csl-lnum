{@Soma@}¦ was the famous plant which was used for the prepara-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its
<div n="lb"/>importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of
<div n="lb"/>the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise.
<div n="P"/>Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs
<div n="lb"/>or shoots are described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>1</sup> ruddy ({%aruṇa%}),<sup>2</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>tawny ({%hari%}).<sup>3</sup> Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet
<div n="lb"/>{@Naicāśākha@}<sup>4</sup> refers to the plant as Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> thinks. The
<div n="lb"/>shoot is called {%aṃśu,%}<sup>6</sup> while the plant as a whole is called
<div n="lb"/>{%andhas,%}<sup>7</sup> which also denotes the juice.<sup>8</sup> {%Parvan%}<sup>9</sup> is the stem.
<div n="lb"/>{%Kṣip,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may
<div n="lb"/>therefore have resembled fingers in shape; {%vakṣaṇā%}<sup>11</sup> and {%vāṇa%}<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight.
<div n="lb"/>evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular.<sup>13</sup>
[Page2-475+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>The plant grew on the mountains,<sup>14</sup> that of {@Müjavant@} being
<div n="lb"/>specially renowned.
<div n="P"/>These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has
<div n="lb"/>been held<sup>15</sup> to be the {%Sarcostemma viminale%} or the {%Asclepias acida%}
<div n="lb"/>{%(= Sarcostemma brevistigma).%} Roth<sup>16</sup> held that the {%Sarcostemma%}
<div n="lb"/>{%acidum%} more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and
<div n="lb"/>Rājendralāla Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an
<div n="lb"/>ingredient in a kind of beer — {%i.e.,%} that the Soma plant was a
<div n="lb"/>species of hop. Hillebrandt<sup>19</sup> considers that neither hops nor
<div n="lb"/>the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very
<div n="lb"/>probable that the plant cannot now be identified.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Yajurveda<sup>21</sup> the plant is purchased ere it is pressed.
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt<sup>22</sup> considers that the sale must be assumed for the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained
<div n="lb"/>by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince
<div n="lb"/>owned it, like the {@Kīkaṭas.@}<sup>23</sup> As it stands, the ritual perform-
<div n="lb"/>ance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>(represented by a Śūdra), a ritual imitation of the action which
<div n="lb"/>may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing
<div n="lb"/>to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great
[Page2-476+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>period.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones
<div n="lb"/>or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of pro-
<div n="lb"/>cedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones
<div n="lb"/>are called {%grāvan%}<sup>25</sup> or {%adri,%}<sup>26</sup> and were, of course, held in the
<div n="lb"/>hands.<sup>27</sup> The plant was laid on boards one beside the other
<div n="lb"/>({@Adhiṣavana@}), and, according at least to the later ritual,<sup>28</sup> a
<div n="lb"/>hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by
<div n="lb"/>means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a
<div n="lb"/>prophylactic against demoniac influences.
<div n="P"/>The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi<sup>29</sup> — which
<div n="lb"/>was no longer done in the later ritual — {@Dhiṣaṇā@} in some
<div n="lb"/>passages denoting the Vedi.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the
<div n="lb"/>stones.<sup>31</sup> This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic times.

<div n="lb"/>applied to the plant itself; but the

<div n="lb"/>scribes {%arjunāni,%} plants of this indefinite
