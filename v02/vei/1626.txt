{@Nau@}¦ is the regular word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for a
<div n="lb"/>‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was
<div n="lb"/>merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat
<div n="lb"/>was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab
<div n="lb"/>as well as the {@Yamunā@} and {@Gaṅgā.@} Often no doubt the Nau
<div n="lb"/>was a mere dug-out canoe ({%dāru%}).<sup>3</sup> It is certainly against the
<div n="lb"/>theory<sup>4</sup> of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea
<div n="lb"/>trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such
<div n="lb"/>as masts and sails, except the oar ({@Aritra@}), Yet there are some
<div n="lb"/>allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied
<div n="lb"/>by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> compares
<div n="lb"/>the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the
[Page1-462+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>sinking of a ship which is leaking ({%bhinnā%}); though the language
<div n="lb"/>here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was
<div n="lb"/>only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>there is mention made in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> of men who go to the
<div n="lb"/>ocean ({@Samudra@}) eager for gain ({%saniṣyavaḥ%}). It is not altogether
<div n="lb"/>satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer<sup>7</sup> to the
<div n="lb"/>broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with
<div n="lb"/>the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> too it is said
<div n="lb"/>that the Aśvins rescued {@Bhujyu@} in the ocean with a ship of
<div n="lb"/>a hundred oars ({%śatāritra%}). It is not easy to refuse to recognize
<div n="lb"/>here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for
<div n="lb"/>sea voyages. The Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup> at any rate,
<div n="lb"/>clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also {@Samudra.@}
