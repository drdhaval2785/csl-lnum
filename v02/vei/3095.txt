{@Vaiśya@}¦ denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the
<div n="lb"/>subject class, distinct from the ruling noble ({@Kṣatriya@}) and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Brāhmaṇa,@} the higher strata of the Āryan community on the
<div n="lb"/>one side, and from the aboriginal {@Śūdra@} on the other. The
<div n="lb"/>name is first found in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and then frequently from the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>onwards,<sup>3</sup> sometimes in the form of Viśya.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vaiśya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature,
<div n="lb"/>which has much to say of Kṣatriya and Brahmin. His
<div n="lb"/>characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>5</sup> in the adjectives {%anyasya bali-kṛt,%} ‘tributary to another’;
<div n="lb"/>{%anyasyādya,%} ‘to be lived upon by another’; and {%yathākāma-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jyeyaḥ,%} ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed
<div n="lb"/>by the king ({@Rājan@}), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the
<div n="lb"/>right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more
<div n="lb"/>and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśyas. But the Vaiśya was not a slave: he could not be
<div n="lb"/>killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring
<div n="lb"/>risk and the payment of a wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which even in the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vaiśya. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>though the Vaiśya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he
<div n="lb"/>cannot be said to have been without property in his land.
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be
<div n="lb"/>a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this
<div n="lb"/>is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove
<div n="lb"/>the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on
<div n="lb"/>the people, as the tales of exiled kings show.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Hopkins<sup>7</sup> is clearly right in holding that
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society
<div n="lb"/>was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon
<div n="lb"/>an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell<sup>8</sup> urged.
<div n="lb"/>Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were
<div n="lb"/>agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were
[Page2-334+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya in life<sup>9</sup> and in death.<sup>10</sup> It would be absurd to suppose
<div n="lb"/>that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and com-
<div n="lb"/>merce ({%cf.%} {@Paṇi, Vaṇij@}), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture
<div n="lb"/>must have been their normal occupations.
<div n="P"/>In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force
<div n="lb"/>under the Kṣatriya leaders (see {@Kṣatriya@}). But like the
<div n="lb"/>Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of
<div n="lb"/>the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either
<div n="lb"/>body armour or offensive weapons.
<div n="P"/>That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the
<div n="lb"/>day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to
<div n="lb"/>that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the
<div n="lb"/>evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic
<div n="lb"/>achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition
<div n="lb"/>was, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>11</sup> to become a
<div n="lb"/>{@Grāmaṇī,@} or village headman, a post probably conferred by the
<div n="lb"/>king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many.
<div n="lb"/>It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vaiśya could attain to
<div n="lb"/>nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be
<div n="lb"/>quoted in support of such a view,<sup>12</sup> though such changes of
<div n="lb"/>status may have taken place (see {@Kṣatriya@} and {@Varṇa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is denied by Fick<sup>13</sup> that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and
<div n="lb"/>the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that
<div n="lb"/>a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and
<div n="lb"/>which follows a hereditary occupation ({%cf.%} {@Varṇa@}). But it
<div n="lb"/>would be wrong<sup>14</sup> to suppose that the term Vaiśya was merely
<div n="lb"/>applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or
<div n="lb"/>priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite
<div n="lb"/>class which was separate from the other classes, and properly
<div n="lb"/>to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were
<div n="lb"/>differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences
<div n="lb"/>among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny
[Page2-335+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other
<div n="lb"/>two are such, though at the present day things are different.
