{@Petva@}¦ is found twice in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> In the first
<div n="lb"/>passage reference is made to its {%vāja,%} which Zimmer<sup>2</sup> argues
<div n="lb"/>can only mean ‘strength,’ ‘swiftness,’ though naturally the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘male power’ would seem more appropriate in a spell
<div n="lb"/>intended to remove lack of virility. In the second passage the
<div n="lb"/>Petva is mentioned as overcoming the horse (see {@Ubhayādant@}),
<div n="lb"/>a miracle which has a parallel in the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>Petva overcomes the female<sup>4</sup> lion. The animal also occurs in
<div n="lb"/>the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the
<div n="lb"/>Yajurveda Saṃhitās,<sup>5</sup> and occasionally elsewhere.<sup>6</sup> It appears
<div n="lb"/>to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter<sup>7</sup> being the sense
<div n="lb"/>given to it by the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
<div n="lb"/>But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning,
<div n="lb"/>while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which
<div n="lb"/>{%vāja%} is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins,<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is
<div n="lb"/>not clear. Whether it is connected in any way with {@Pitva@} or
<div n="lb"/>{@Pidva@} is quite uncertain.

<div n="lb"/>{%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
<div n="lb"/>15, 264, takes it as masculine, and as
<div n="lb"/>a play on {%śiṃyum,%} the name of one of
<div n="lb"/>the kings or peoples defeated in the
<div n="lb"/>battle of the ten kings. But, admitting
<div n="lb"/>the play, {%siṃhī%} as fem. seems to be still
<div n="lb"/>more pointed than {%siṃha,%} contrasting
<div n="lb"/>with the masculine {%petva.%}</F>

<div n="lb"/>Though not in the parallel passage of
<div n="lb"/>the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, it appears to
<div n="lb"/>be found in the Kāṭhaka, according
<div n="lb"/>to Weber's note in his edition of the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā.</F>

<div n="lb"/>He thinks the born of the goat pierced
<div n="lb"/>the lion. Curiously enough, Whitney,
<div n="lb"/>Translation of the Atharvaveda, 253.
<div n="lb"/>renders the word a ‘goat’ in Av.
<div n="lb"/>v. 19, 2, but (p. 151) as ‘ram’ in iv. 4, 8;
<div n="lb"/>and Bloomfield {%Hymns of the Atharva-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%veda,%} 434, speaks Both of a ‘ram’ and a
<div n="lb"/>‘goat’ in connexion with v. 19, 2.</F>
