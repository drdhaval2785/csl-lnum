{@Adri.@}¦ — Zimmer<sup>1</sup> deduces from the use of this word (‘rock,’
<div n="lb"/>‘stone’) in a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> that sling-stones were
<div n="lb"/>used in Vedic fighting. But the passage is mythical, referring
<div n="lb"/>to Indra's aid, and cannot be used with any certainty as
<div n="lb"/>evidence for human war. More probably it merely denotes
<div n="lb"/>Indra's bolt. See also {@Aśani.@}
