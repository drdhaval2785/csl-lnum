{@Saṃ-grāma@}¦ denotes primarily, it seems, ‘assembly’ either in
<div n="lb"/>peace<sup>1</sup> or in war,<sup>2</sup> when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal
<div n="lb"/>sense in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> and later<sup>4</sup> is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’
[Page2-417+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been
<div n="lb"/>simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed
<div n="lb"/>every army, the two going together,<sup>5</sup> and the foot soldiers being
<div n="lb"/>often overthrown by the charioteers,<sup>6</sup> who were doubtless
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the
<div n="lb"/>foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for
<div n="lb"/>offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of
<div n="lb"/>the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded
<div n="lb"/>Greece.<sup>7</sup> The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass
<div n="lb"/>({@Varman@}), helmet ({@Śiprā@}), and hand-guard ({@Hastaghna@}) as a
<div n="lb"/>protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was
<div n="lb"/>the charioteer, and on his left the warrior ({@Sārathi, Savyaṣṭhā@}).
<div n="lb"/>Riding is never mentioned in war,<sup>8</sup> and would hardly have
<div n="lb"/>been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on
<div n="lb"/>his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horse-
<div n="lb"/>back. The offensive weapon ({@Āyudha@}) was practically the
<div n="lb"/>bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used.
<div n="P"/>Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host,
<div n="lb"/>such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems,<sup>9</sup> and is also
<div n="lb"/>recognized in Germany by Tacitus,<sup>10</sup> is uncertain ({%cf.%} {@Vrāta@}),
<div n="lb"/>but in the Epic relations ({@Jñāti@}) fight together,<sup>11</sup> and this rule,
<div n="lb"/>no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also.
<div n="P"/>Cities were besieged and invested ({%upa-sad, pra-bhid%}),<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of
<div n="lb"/>assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and
<div n="lb"/>expensive. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> thinks that the {%pur cariṣṇū%} of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>14</sup> was a kind of chariot; it may — like the Trojan
<div n="lb"/>horse — have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means
<div n="lb"/>of assaulting a town.
<div n="P"/>Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into
[Page2-418+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal,<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>no doubt because of the booty ({@Udāja, Nirāja@}) which was to be
<div n="lb"/>won, and which the king had to share with the people.
<div n="P"/>Banners ({@Dhvaja@}) were borne in war, and musical instru-
<div n="lb"/>ments ({@Dundubhi, Bakura@})<sup>16</sup> were used by the combatants.
