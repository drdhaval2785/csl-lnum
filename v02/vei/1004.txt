{@Jana,@}¦ besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a
<div n="lb"/>tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’
<div n="lb"/>or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’
<div n="lb"/>({@Panca Janāḥ@} or {@Janāsaḥ@}) are frequently referred to, and in
<div n="lb"/>one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the ‘people of Yadu’ ({%yādva jana%})
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Yadus@} ({%yādvāḥ%}) are synonymous. Again, the king
<div n="lb"/>({%rājan%}) is described as ‘protector ({%gopā%}) of the people ({%janasya%}),’<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and there are other references to king and Jana.<sup>3</sup> The people
<div n="lb"/>of the {@Bharatas@} ({%bhārata jana%}) is also mentioned;<sup>4</sup> there is no
<div n="lb"/>ground to assume with Hopkins<sup>5</sup> that Jana in this case means
<div n="lb"/>a clan or horde ({@Grāma@}), as distinguished from a people.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>6</sup> argues from a passage in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> that a people
<div n="lb"/>was divided into cantons ({@Viś@}), cantons into joint families or
<div n="lb"/>clans, or village communities ({@Grāma, Vṛjana@}), and these again
<div n="lb"/>into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are
<div n="lb"/>reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Viś, Janman, and
<div n="lb"/>Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was
<div n="lb"/>originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful
<div n="lb"/>whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The
<div n="lb"/>division of the Jana into several Viś may be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> which mentions the Viś as a unit of the fighting
<div n="lb"/>men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient
<div n="lb"/>Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military
<div n="lb"/>arrangement. But the subdivision of the Viś into several
<div n="lb"/>Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer<sup>9</sup> admits that neither Grāma<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-270+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>nor {@Vṛjana@}<sup>11</sup> has the special sense of a subdivision of the Viś
<div n="lb"/>when used for war, for both words only denote generally an
<div n="lb"/>armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in
<div n="lb"/>{@Vrā@}<sup>12</sup> and in {@Vrāja,@}<sup>13</sup> but it is sufficient to say that the former
<div n="lb"/>passage is of extremely doubtful import,<sup>14</sup> and that the latter
<div n="lb"/>has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state
<div n="lb"/>in what exact relation the Grāma in Vedic times stood to the
<div n="lb"/>Viś or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased
<div n="lb"/>by the vagueness of the sense of both Grāma and Viś. If the
<div n="lb"/>latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Grāma
<div n="lb"/>must have been a part of a district; but if a Viś was a unit of
<div n="lb"/>relationship, then a Grāma may have contained families of
<div n="lb"/>different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a
<div n="lb"/>Viś, or have contained only a part of a Viś. But in any
<div n="lb"/>case the original state of affairs must have been greatly
<div n="lb"/>modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitu-
<div n="lb"/>tion of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The
<div n="lb"/>elements of the people were represented by the family — either
<div n="lb"/>as an individual family inhabiting one home ({@Kula@}), and con-
<div n="lb"/>sisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a
<div n="lb"/>patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father — and
<div n="lb"/>by the clan, the later {@Gotra,@} which included all those who
<div n="lb"/>claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>roughly corresponding to the Latin {%gens%} and the Greek <lang n="greek">γένος</lang>,
<div n="lb"/>and possibly the Viś may be the equivalent of the {%curia%} and
<lang n="greek">φρήτρη</lang>, and the Jana of the {%tribus%} and <lang n="greek">φῦλον</lang> or <lang n="greek">φῦλη</lang>.<sup>15</sup> These
<div n="lb"/>three divisions may also be seen in the Viś, Zantu, and Daqyu
<div n="lb"/>of the Iranian world, where the use of Viś suggests that in the
<div n="lb"/>Indian Viś a relationship based on blood rather than locality is
<div n="lb"/>meant — and perhaps even in the {%vicus, pagus,%} and {%civitas%} of the
<div n="lb"/>old German polity described in the Germania<sup>16</sup> of Tacitus.
<div n="lb"/>The family in some form appears as the third element of the
<div n="lb"/>Jana in a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> where the house ({%gṛha%}) is
[Page1-271+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>contrasted with the Jana and the Viś. Possibly, too, another
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>18</sup> contrasts the {%adhvara,%} or family sacrifice, with that of
<div n="lb"/>the Jana or Viś, rather than, as Zimmer<sup>19</sup> thinks, the village
<div n="lb"/>with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particu-
<div n="lb"/>larism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a
<div n="lb"/>fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe,
<div n="lb"/>there is no sure trace<sup>20</sup> of any intermediate cult between that of
<div n="lb"/>the king and that of the individual householder. The real
<div n="lb"/>elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as
<div n="lb"/>ultimately the {%gens%} and {%tribus,%} the <lang n="greek">γένος</lang> and <lang n="greek">φῦλον</lang> are alone
<div n="lb"/>important. It may be that Viś sometimes represents in the
<div n="lb"/>older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See {@Viś.@}
<div n="P"/>This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa period is considered. The tribe or people still exists,
<div n="lb"/>and is presupposed, but the division into Viś disappears. The
<div n="lb"/>real division is now the separate castes ({@Varṇa@}), but the
<div n="lb"/>numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to
<div n="lb"/>be based in part on the ancient Gotra.
