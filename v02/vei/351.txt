{@Uddālaka Āruṇi.@}¦ — Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the
<div n="lb"/>most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa.<sup>1</sup> This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was
<div n="lb"/>teacher of {@Proti Kausurubindi@} of Kauśāmbī,<sup>2</sup> and that his son
[Page1-088+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>{@Svetaketu@} is found disputing among the Pañcālas.<sup>3</sup> He was a
<div n="lb"/>pupil of Aruṇa, his father,<sup>4</sup> as well as of Patañcala Kāpya,<sup>5</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki,<sup>7</sup> although the former is represented
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as having silenced him. He overcame in argument
<div n="lb"/>Prācīnayogya Śauceya,<sup>9</sup> and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājāta-
<div n="lb"/>śatrava,<sup>10</sup> though the text here seems to read the name as
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇi. He was a Gautama,<sup>11</sup> and is often alluded to as such.
<div n="lb"/>As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>13</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>14</sup> and occasionally in the Aitareya,<sup>15</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki,<sup>16</sup> and the Ṣaḍviṃśa<sup>17</sup> Brāhmaṇas, as well as the
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.<sup>18</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not
<div n="lb"/>mentioned, according to Geldner,<sup>19</sup> but only his father Aruṇa;
<div n="lb"/>his name does not occur, according to Weber,<sup>20</sup> in the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> he is, as
<div n="lb"/>Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of {@Divodāsa Bhaimaseni,@} and
<div n="lb"/>in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> he is mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>serving {@Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya.@} In the Taittirīya tradition he
<div n="lb"/>seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>23</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>24</sup> Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who
[Page1-089+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.<sup>25</sup> But the episode of
<div n="lb"/>Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of
<div n="lb"/>historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous
<div n="lb"/>{@Śvetaketu,@} who is expressly reported by Āpastamba<sup>26</sup> to have
<div n="lb"/>been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of
<div n="lb"/>importance for the date of Āruṇi.
