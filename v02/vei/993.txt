{@Cyavana,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Cyavāna,@}<sup>2</sup> are variant forms of the name of an
<div n="lb"/>ancient Ṛṣi, or seer. The Rigveda<sup>3</sup> represents him as an old
<div n="lb"/>decrepit man, to whom the Aśvins restored youth and strength,
<div n="lb"/>making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens.
[Page1-265+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>4</sup> where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanyā,
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of {@Śaryāta.@} He is there called a Bhṛgu or
<div n="lb"/>Āṅgirasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by
<div n="lb"/>immersion in a pond — the first occurrence of a motive, later
<div n="lb"/>very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about
<div n="lb"/>Cyavāna is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> where he seems to be opposed to the {@Paktha@} prince
<div n="lb"/>{@Tūrvayāṇa,@} an Indra worshipper, while Cyavāna seems to
<div n="lb"/>have been specially connected with the Aśvins. This explana-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the hymn, suggested by Pischel,<sup>6</sup> is corroborated by the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> which relates that {@Vidanvant,@} another
<div n="lb"/>son of Bhṛgu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was
<div n="lb"/>angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also note-
<div n="lb"/>worthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanyā.
<div n="lb"/>But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken
<div n="lb"/>place, because the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> relates the inauguration
<div n="lb"/>of {@Śāryāta@} by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration
<div n="lb"/>({%aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa%}). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans or Chants.
