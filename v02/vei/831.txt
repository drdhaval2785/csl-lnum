1. {@Khila,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Khilya@}<sup>2</sup> appear to have the same meaning.
<div n="lb"/>According to Roth,<sup>3</sup> these terms denote the waste land lying
<div n="lb"/>between cultivated fields; but he admits that this sense does
<div n="lb"/>not suit the passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> in which it is said that
<div n="lb"/>the god places the worshipper on an unbroken Khilya ({%abhinne%}
<div n="lb"/>{%khilye%}), and he accordingly conjectures the reading {%akhilya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhinne,%} ‘land unbroken by barren strips.’ Pischel<sup>5</sup> thinks that
<div n="lb"/>the meaning intended is broad lands, which were used for the
<div n="lb"/>pasturing of the cattle of the community, and were not broken
<div n="lb"/>up by cultivated fields. Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> however, points out that
<div n="lb"/>the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields,
<div n="lb"/>but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as
<div n="lb"/>Roth thought. This agrees with the fact that in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>times separate fields were already known: see {@Kṣetra.@}
