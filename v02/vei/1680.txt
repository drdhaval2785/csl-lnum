{@Parāśara@}¦ is mentioned with {@Śatayātu@} and {@Vasiṣṭha@} in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigvedic hymn celebrating {@Sudās'@}<sup>1</sup> victory over the ten kings.
<div n="lb"/>According to the Nirukta<sup>2</sup> he was a son of Vasiṣṭha, but the
<div n="lb"/>Epic version makes him a son of {@Śakti@} and grandson of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Geldner<sup>3</sup> thinks that he is mentioned in the Rigveda along with
<div n="lb"/>Śatayātu, perhaps his uncle, and his grandfather Vasiṣṭha, as
<div n="lb"/>the three sages who approached Indra and won his favour for
<div n="lb"/>Sudās. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of
<div n="lb"/>certain hymns of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> by the Anukramaṇī (Index).
