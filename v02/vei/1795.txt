{@Pārthava,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Pṛthu,@}’ occurs once in the Rig-
<div n="lb"/>veda,<sup>1</sup> where the Pārthavas are mentioned as generous donors.
<div n="lb"/>The passage is somewhat obscure, as there is a reference<sup>2</sup> to a
<div n="lb"/>defeat of the {@Turvaśas@} and the {@Vṛcīvants@} by {@Sṛñjaya Daiva-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@vāta,@} followed in the next verse by the praise of the bounty to
<div n="lb"/>the singer of {@Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna,@} who was clearly a
<div n="lb"/>{@Pārthava,@} and who, in the earlier part of the hymn, has been
<div n="lb"/>referred to as victorious over {@Varaśikha.@} It is uncertain
<div n="lb"/>whether, as Zimmer<sup>3</sup> suggests, the two princes, Abhyāvartin
[Page1-522+ 34]
<div n="lb"/>Cāyamāna and Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, are identical or not.<sup>4</sup> That
<div n="lb"/>Pārthava has any direct connexion with the Parthians, as held
<div n="lb"/>by Brunnhofer, is most improbable.<sup>5</sup> {%Cf.%} {@Parśu.@}
