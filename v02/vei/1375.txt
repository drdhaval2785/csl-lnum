{@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa@}¦ (‘descendant of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa’) is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and in the Nirukta.<sup>2</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the latter source there were two brothers, {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@}
<div n="lb"/>princes of the Kurus. The elder was Devāpi, but Śantanu got
<div n="lb"/>himself anointed king, whereupon no rain fell for twelve years.
<div n="lb"/>The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having
<div n="lb"/>superseded his elder brother, Śantanu offered the kingdom to
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Bṛhad-
<div n="lb"/>devatā<sup>3</sup> tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered
<div n="lb"/>from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further
[Page1-378+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts.
<div n="lb"/>According to the one version,<sup>4</sup> the ground of Devāpi's being
<div n="lb"/>passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting
<div n="lb"/>himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's
<div n="lb"/>taking his place. The Epic,<sup>5</sup> moreover, treats him as a son of
<div n="lb"/>Pratīpa, and names as his brothers Bāhlīka<sup>6</sup> and Āṛṣṭiṣeṇa,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>who is a new figure developed from the patronymic of Devāpi
<div n="lb"/>Possibly Sieg<sup>8</sup> is right in holding that two stories, those of
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi, Pratīpa's son, and of Devāpi, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa's son, have been
<div n="lb"/>confused; but in any case it is impossible to extract history
<div n="lb"/>from them.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigvedic hymn certainly appears to represent Devāpi
<div n="lb"/>as sacrificing for Śantanu, who seems to be called {@Aulāna.@}<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But there is no trace in it of the brotherhood of the two men,
<div n="lb"/>nor is there anything to show that Devāpi was not a Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>but a Kṣatriya. Sieg,<sup>11</sup> who interprets the hymn by the
<div n="lb"/>Nirukta, thinks that he was a Kṣatriya, but on this occasion
<div n="lb"/>was enabled by the favour of Bṛhaspati to officiate as priest,
<div n="lb"/>and that the hymn shows clear recognition of the unusual
<div n="lb"/>character of his action; but this view seems very improbable.
