{@Tūrvayāṇa@}¦ is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda.
<div n="lb"/>He appears by name in two passages,<sup>1</sup> and is clearly alluded
<div n="lb"/>to in a third,<sup>2</sup> as an enemy of {@Atithigva, Āyu,@} and {@Kutsa.@}
<div n="lb"/>With this accords the fact that the {@Pakthas@} were opposed in
<div n="lb"/>the battle of the ten kings to the Tṛtsus,<sup>3</sup> and that Tūrvayāṇa
<div n="lb"/> is shown by another passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> to have been
<div n="lb"/>a prince of the Pakthas. He is there represented as having
<div n="lb"/>been a protégé of Indra, who aided him against {@Cyavāna@} and
<div n="lb"/>his guardians, the Maruts. It is not probable that he is
<div n="lb"/>identical with {@Suśravas.@}<sup>5</sup>

<F>2) ii. 14, 7 (as a comparison of the
<div n="lb"/>two preceding passages shows); per-
<div n="lb"/>haps also viii. 53, 2. In i. 174, 3,
<div n="lb"/>Tūrvayāṇa seems also to be a proper
<div n="lb"/>name, though Roth, St. Petersburg
<div n="lb"/>Dictionary, {%s.v.,%} here regards the word
<div n="lb"/>as an adjective.</F>
