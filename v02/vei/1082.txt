{@Jñāti@}¦ (masc.), a word which originally seems to have meant
<div n="lb"/>‘acquaintance,’<sup>1</sup> denotes in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> a ‘relation,’
<div n="lb"/>apparently one who was connected by blood on the father's
<div n="lb"/>side, though the passages do not necessarily require the
<div n="lb"/>limitation. But this sense follows naturally enough from the
<div n="lb"/>patriarchal basis of Vedic society.<sup>4</sup>
<F>1) Being in all probability derived
<div n="lb"/>from {%jñā,%} ‘know,’ not from {%jan,%} ‘beget,’
<div n="lb"/>as would at first sight seem more likely
<div n="lb"/>on account of the sense. {%Cf.%} the
<div n="lb"/>St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%}</F>
<F>2) vii. 55, 5, seems to refer to the
<div n="lb"/>members of the joint family sleeping
<div n="lb"/>in the paternal house; x. 66, 14; 85,
<div n="lb"/>28 (the kinsmen of the bride are
<div n="lb"/>meant); 117, 9 (perhaps ‘brother and
<div n="lb"/>sister’ are meant by {%jñātī%} here, but
<div n="lb"/>‘kinsfolk’ will do; {%of.%} Muir, {%Sanskrit%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Texts,%} 5, 432).</F>
<F>3) Av. xii. 5, 44 (where Whitney in
<div n="lb"/>his Translation renders the word by
<div n="lb"/>‘acquaintances,’ which seems too vague
<div n="lb"/>and feeble); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6,
<div n="lb"/>5, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 3
<div n="lb"/>({%jñātibhyāṃ vā sakhibhyāṃ, vā,%} ‘where
<div n="lb"/>‘relations’ are contrasted with ‘friends’
<div n="lb"/>or ‘companions’); ii. 2, 2, 20; 5, 2,
<div n="lb"/>20; xi. 3, 3, 7, etc.</F>
<F>4) For the transition from the etymo-
<div n="lb"/>logical meaning, {%cf.%} <lang n="greek">γνωτός, γνωτή</lang>,
<div n="lb"/>which in Homer designate ‘brother’
<div n="lb"/>and ‘sister’; St. Petersburg Dic-
<div n="lb"/>tionary, {%s.v.%}</F>
