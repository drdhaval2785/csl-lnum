{@Jani, Janī.@}¦ — These words appear to denote ‘wife,’ usually
<div n="lb"/>applying to her in relation to her husband ({@Pati@}). The more
<div n="lb"/>general sense of ‘woman’ is doubtful; for when Uṣas is called
<div n="lb"/>a fair {@Janī,@}<sup>1</sup> ‘wife’ may be meant, and the other passage<sup>2</sup> cited
<div n="lb"/>for this sense by Delbrück,<sup>3</sup> which refers to the begetting of
<div n="lb"/>children, seems to demand the sense of ‘wives.’ Since the
<div n="lb"/>words usually appear in the plural,<sup>4</sup> it is possible they may
[Page1-275+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>refer not to ‘wives’ proper, but to Hetairai. This is, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, rendered unlikely because the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> uses the phrase
<div n="lb"/>{%patyur janitvam,%} denoting ‘wifehood to a husband,’ as well
<div n="lb"/>as the expression {%janayo na patnīḥ,%}<sup>6</sup> ‘like wives (who are)
<div n="lb"/>mistresses,’<sup>7</sup> besides containing passages in which the word has
<div n="lb"/>reference to marriage.<sup>8</sup> The singular occurs in the dialogue of
<div n="lb"/>Yama and Yamī.<sup>9</sup>

<F>7) The distinction of sense was prob-
<div n="lb"/>ably this: {%jani%} meant ‘wife,’ as bearing
<div n="lb"/>children (from {%jan,%} ‘beget’), while
<div n="lb"/>{%patnī%} was ‘wife,’ as being mistress
<div n="lb"/>of the house (feminine of {%pati,%} ‘lord,’
<div n="lb"/>‘husband’).</F>
<F>8) v. 61, 3. So in x. 40, 10, the word
<div n="lb"/>seems certainly to refer to marriage.</F>
