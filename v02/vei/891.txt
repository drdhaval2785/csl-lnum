1. {@Go@}¦ ({%a%}), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’<sup>1</sup> These were among the chief
<div n="lb"/>sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly
[Page1-232+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>referred to from the Rigveda onwards.<sup>2</sup> The milk ({@Kṣīra@}) was
<div n="lb"/>either drunk fresh or made into butter ({@Ghṛta@}) or curds ({@Dadhi@}),
<div n="lb"/>or was mixed with {@Soma@} or used for cooking with grain
<div n="lb"/>({@Kṣīraudana@}). The cows were milked thrice a day, early
<div n="lb"/>({%prātar-doha%}), in the forenoon ({@Saṃgava@}), and in the evening
<div n="lb"/>({%sāyaṃ-doha%}).<sup>3</sup> Thrice a day they were driven out to graze,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> ({%prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam%}).
<div n="lb"/>The first milking was productive, the last two scanty.<sup>3</sup> According
<div n="lb"/>to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> among the Bharatas the herds in
<div n="lb"/>the evening are in the {@Goṣṭha,@} at midday in the {@Saṃgavīnī.@}
<div n="lb"/>This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home
<div n="lb"/>to the Śālā, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist
<div n="lb"/>of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the
<div n="lb"/>Goṣṭha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the
<div n="lb"/>cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before
<div n="lb"/>the Saṃgava, when the cows were grazing freely on the
<div n="lb"/>pastureland, was called {@Svasara.@}<sup>6</sup> When the cows were out
<div n="lb"/>feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, allowed to join them at the Saṃgava,<sup>7</sup> and sometimes in
<div n="lb"/>the evening.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman
<div n="lb"/>({@Gopā, Gopāla@}) armed with a goad,<sup>9</sup> but they were liable to all sorts
<div n="lb"/>of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs,<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-233+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the
<div n="lb"/>Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> even when
<div n="lb"/>allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude.
<div n="lb"/>The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper
<div n="lb"/>them, and by the repeated prayers<sup>14</sup> for wealth in kine. Hence,
<div n="lb"/>too, forays for cattle ({@Gaviṣṭi@}) were well known; the Bharata
<div n="lb"/>host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}) in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda;<sup>15</sup> and a verbal root {%gup,%}<sup>16</sup> ‘to protect,’ was evolved as
<div n="lb"/>early as the Rigveda from the denominative {%go-pāya,%} ‘to guard
<div n="lb"/>cows.’ The Vedic poets<sup>17</sup> do not hesitate to compare their
<div n="lb"/>songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the
<div n="lb"/>singing Apsarases to cows.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red
<div n="lb"/>({%rohita%}), light ({%śukra%}), dappled ({%pṛśni%}), even black ({%kṛṣṇa%}).<sup>19</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>20</sup> sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Rigveda,<sup>21</sup> but this is uncertain.
<div n="P"/>Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing
<div n="lb"/>wagons ({%anaḍvāh%}), in which case they were, it seems, usually
<div n="lb"/>castrated.<sup>22</sup> Cows were not properly used for drawing carts,
<div n="lb"/>though they at times did so.<sup>23</sup> The flesh of both cows and
<div n="lb"/>bulls was sometimes eaten ({@Māmsa@}). Cattle were certainly the
[Page1-234+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the
<div n="lb"/>standards of exchange and valuation (see {@Kraya@}).
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The term {@Go@} is often applied to express the products of
<div n="lb"/>the cow. It frequently means the milk,<sup>1</sup> but rarely the flesh<sup>2</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the
<div n="lb"/>material of various objects, as a bowstring,<sup>3</sup> or a sling,<sup>4</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>thongs to fasten part of the chariot,<sup>5</sup> or reins,<sup>6</sup> or the lash
<div n="lb"/>of a whip.<sup>7</sup> See also {@Carman,@} with which Go is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>synonymous.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) {@Gāvaḥ@} means the stars of heaven in two passages of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> according to Roth.<sup>2</sup>

<div n="lb"/>shed in the morning, spent the heat
<div n="lb"/>of the day in the Saṃgavinī, were then
<div n="lb"/>driven out during the evening to graze,
<div n="lb"/>and finally came or were driven home,
