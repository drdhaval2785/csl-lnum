{@Bali@}¦ occurs several times in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and often later<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He
<div n="lb"/>compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus,<sup>4</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents,
<div n="lb"/>but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground what-
<div n="lb"/>ever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of
<div n="lb"/>monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the
<div n="lb"/>tribesmen,<sup>5</sup> but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially
<div n="lb"/>a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most
<div n="lb"/>improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods
<div n="lb"/>was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer admits that in the case of hostile tribes<sup>6</sup> tribute must
<div n="lb"/>be meant even in the Rigveda. See also {@Rājan.@}
