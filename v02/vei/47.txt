{@Aty-arāti Jānaṃ-tapi,@}¦ though not a prince, was taught the
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya by {@Vāsiṣṭha Satyahavya,@} and thereupon conquered
<div n="lb"/>the earth. When Vāsiṣṭha reminded him of his indebtedness,
<div n="lb"/>and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that
<div n="lb"/>he intended to conquer the {@Uttara Kurus,@} and that Vāsiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being
<div n="lb"/>his general ({%senā-pati%}). Vāsiṣṭha replied that as no mortal man
<div n="lb"/>could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward.
[Page1-017+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>He consequently procured Atyarāti's defeat and death at the
<div n="lb"/>hands of {@Amitratapana Śuṣmiṇa Śaibya.@}<sup>1</sup>
