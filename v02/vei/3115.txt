{@Vrāja-pati@}¦ is found in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it
<div n="lb"/>is said that comrades attend Indra, as the {@Kulapas@} the Vrāja-
<div n="lb"/>pati, when he goes about. Zimmer<sup>2</sup> thinks that this refers to
<div n="lb"/>the heads of families being subordinate in war to the village
<div n="lb"/>headman ({@Grāmaṇī@}), but Whitney<sup>3</sup> seems to be right in seeing
<div n="lb"/>merely the chieftain surrounded by the leading men, the family
<div n="lb"/>heads, not necessarily merely a village headman. Vrāja alone
<div n="lb"/>occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup> adverbially in the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘in troops.’
