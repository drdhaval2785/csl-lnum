{@Asamāti Rātha-prauṣṭha.@}¦ — The story of the quarrel between
<div n="lb"/>Asamāti, the Ikṣvāku prince of the Rathaproṣṭha family, and
[Page1-047+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>his priests, the Gaupāyanas, is found only in the later
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> It appears to be based on a misreading of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> where {%asamāti%} is merely an adjective. The later
<div n="lb"/>story is that the king was induced to abandon his family priests
<div n="lb"/>by two Asuras, Kirāta and Ākuli, who by their magic com-
<div n="lb"/>passed the death of Subandhu, one of the brother priests, and
<div n="lb"/>that the others revived him by the use of the hymns (Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>x. 57-60).
