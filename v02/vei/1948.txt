{@Potṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the priests ({@Ṛtvij@}) of the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficial ritual. Already known to the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> he is frequently
<div n="lb"/>mentioned later in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup> But as Oldenberg<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>observes, the Potṛ is not in the later literature a priest of any
<div n="lb"/>importance, but is practically a mere name. Judging by the
<div n="lb"/>derivation of the name from the root {%pū,%} ‘purify,’ it would
<div n="lb"/>seem that he was properly engaged in the purification of the
<div n="lb"/>{%Soma pavamāna,%} ‘Soma purifying itself,’ and was perhaps
<div n="lb"/>employed to sing hymns to this Soma. Potra<sup>4</sup> denotes both
<div n="lb"/>the office and the Soma vessel of the Potṛ.<sup>5</sup>
