{@Strī@}¦ is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’
<div n="lb"/>without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. {@Nārī@}
<div n="lb"/>has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while {@Gnā@}
<div n="lb"/>refers only to the wives of the gods, and {@Yoṣit,@} with its cognate
<div n="lb"/>words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage.<sup>1</sup> In the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>2</sup> Strī stands opposed to {@Pumāṃs,@} ‘man,’ and once to
<div n="lb"/>{%vṛṣan,%} ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> does it mean
<div n="lb"/>‘wife’ as opposed to {@Pati,@} ‘husband,’ and even in the Sūtras it
<div n="lb"/>is sharply opposed to {@Jāyā.@}
<div n="P"/>In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was
<div n="lb"/>taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and
<div n="lb"/>{@Mātṛ@}). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion
<div n="lb"/>of women, which was practically complete in all but the
<div n="lb"/>earliest Epic:<sup>4</sup> the maiden may be assumed to have grown up
<div n="lb"/>in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth
<div n="lb"/>of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Educa-
<div n="lb"/>tion<sup>5</sup> was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for
<div n="lb"/>we hear in the Upaniṣads of women who could take no
<div n="lb"/>unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were
<div n="lb"/>unmanly accomplishments.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few
<div n="lb"/>and meagre. The Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> however, shows that in the place
[Page2-486+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brother-
<div n="lb"/>less maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors
<div n="lb"/>were believed to await the man who took advantage of their
<div n="lb"/>defencelessness.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, women could not take an inherit-
<div n="lb"/>ance,<sup>9</sup> and were not independent persons in the eyes of the
<div n="lb"/>law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage
<div n="lb"/>they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their
<div n="lb"/>husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing
<div n="lb"/>them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the
<div n="lb"/>necessity of maintaining the wife.<sup>10</sup> Their earnings would be
<div n="lb"/>appropriated by their nearest relative — usually father or brother
<div n="lb"/>-in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn
<div n="lb"/>anything, as in the case of courtezans.
