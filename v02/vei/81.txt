{@Anvā-khyāna.@}¦ — From the literal translation (‘after-story’) the
<div n="lb"/>meaning of ‘supplementary narrative’ seems to follow. In two<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>of its three occurrences in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa this sense
<div n="lb"/>is hardly felt, the expression being used to indicate a subse-
<div n="lb"/>quent portion of the book itself. But in the third<sup>2</sup> passage it
<div n="lb"/>is distinguished from the {@Itihāsa@} (‘story’) proper, and there
<div n="lb"/>must mean ‘supplementary narrative.’ {%Cf.%} {@Anuvyākhyāna.@}
<F>1) vi. 5, 2, 22; 6, 4, 7 (the reference
<div n="lb"/>is to vi. 6, 4, 8).</F>
<F>2) xi. 1, 6, 9.
<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} Sieg, {%Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda,%} 34.</F>
