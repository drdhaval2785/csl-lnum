{@Nir-āla@}¦ occurs once in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> where Sāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>regards it as the name of a disease. Bloomfield,<sup>2</sup> with the
<div n="lb"/>Padapāṭha, explains it as two words, understanding {%nir%} as an
<div n="lb"/>elliptical imperative, ‘(go) out,’ with the vocative {%āla,%} a kind
<div n="lb"/>of weed. Whitney<sup>3</sup> at first took {%āla%} to be a verbal form, but
<div n="lb"/>finally came to the conclusion that the expression is one word,
<div n="lb"/>{%nirāla,%} of unknown sense.
