{@Abhyā-vartin Cāyamāna@}¦ appears in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of
<div n="lb"/>Gifts’) in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and as conqueror of the Vṛcīvants
<div n="lb"/>under the leader {@Varaśikha.@} It is probable though not abso-
<div n="lb"/>lutely certain, that he is identical with the {@Sṛñjaya Daivavāta,@}
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the same hymn<sup>2</sup> as having the {@Turvaśas@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Vṛcīvants@} defeated for him by Indra. In this case he would
<div n="lb"/>be prince ({%samrāj%}) of the Sṛñjayas. Daivavāta is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere<sup>3</sup> as a worshipper of Agni.
<div n="P"/>Abhyāvartin is also referred to as a Pārthava. Ludwig<sup>4</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> maintained that he is thus a Parthian, the latter
<div n="lb"/>using the evidence of the two places mentioned in the descrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion<sup>6</sup> of Daivavāta's victories, {@Hariyūpīyā@} and {@Yavyāvatī,@} as
<div n="lb"/>proofs for the western position of Abhyāvartin's people in
<div n="lb"/>Arachosia, in Iran. But Zimmer<sup>7</sup> is probably right in holding
<div n="lb"/>that the name Pārthava merely means ‘a descendant of Pṛthu,’
<div n="lb"/>and that its similarity to the Iranian Parthians is only on a par
<div n="lb"/>with the numerous other points of identity between the Indian
<div n="lb"/>and Iranian cultures.
