{@Hiraṇin,@}¦ ‘rich in gold,’ is apparently an epithet of {@Trasa-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@dasyu@} in one verse of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> referring to the golden
<div n="lb"/>raiment or possessions of the king. Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> however, thinks
<div n="lb"/>the word is a proper name, possibly of Trasadasyu's son.
