{@Cakra,@}¦ the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, often in a metaphorical
<div n="lb"/>sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle ({@Akṣa@}) when the
<div n="lb"/>chariot was required for use; this required considerable
<div n="lb"/>strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>wheel consisted normally of spokes ({@Ara@}), and a nave ({@Nābhi@}),<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in the opening ({@Kha@}) of which the end of the axle ({@Āṇi@}) was
<div n="lb"/>inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the
<div n="lb"/>strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god
<div n="lb"/>Pūṣan as having a wheel that suffers no damage.<sup>4</sup> The usual
<div n="lb"/>number of wheels was two,<sup>5</sup> but in seven passages of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘seven-
<div n="lb"/>wheeled,’<sup>7</sup> while in one of the Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> it is styled ‘eight-
<div n="lb"/>wheeled.’ Zimmer<sup>9</sup> argues that these epithets do not refer to
<div n="lb"/>real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where
<div n="lb"/>{%tri-cakra,%} ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, Weber<sup>10</sup> thinks that there might have been
<div n="lb"/>chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the
<div n="lb"/>two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the
<div n="lb"/>seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that
<div n="lb"/>number of wheels.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> the potter's wheel ({%kaulāla-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%cakra%}) is referred to.
