2. {@Balhika Prātipīya@}¦ is the name of a {@Kuru@} king in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where he appears as having been opposed
<div n="lb"/>to the restoration of {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana@} to his hereditary
<div n="lb"/>sovereignty over the {@Sṛñjayas,@} but as having failed to prevent
[Page2-064+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>the restoration being carried out by {@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Sthapati.@} The epithet Prātipīya is curious: if it connects him
<div n="lb"/>with {@Pratīpa@} (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is
<div n="lb"/>remarkable, Zimmer<sup>2</sup> indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya.
<div n="lb"/>In the Epic and the Purāṇas<sup>3</sup> he is in the form of Vāhlīka
<div n="lb"/>made a brother of {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} and a son of Pratīpa.
<div n="lb"/>To base chronological conclusions on this<sup>4</sup> would be utterly
<div n="lb"/>misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa
<div n="lb"/>and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown
<div n="lb"/>parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be
<div n="lb"/>a late figure in the Vedic age, later than {@Parikṣit,@} being his
<div n="lb"/>great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a
<div n="lb"/>descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name Balhika
<div n="lb"/>must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort
<div n="lb"/>regarding it.
