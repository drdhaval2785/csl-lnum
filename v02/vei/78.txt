{@Andhra@}¦ is the name of a people, and is mentioned with the
<div n="lb"/>{@Puṇḍras, Śabaras, Pulindas,@} and {@Mūtibas,@} as being the outcasts
<div n="lb"/>resulting from the refusal of the fifty eldest sons of {@Viśvāmitra@}
<div n="lb"/>to accept his adoption of {@Śunaḥśepa.@}<sup>1</sup> It may fairly be deduced
[Page1-024+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>from this statement that these people were recognized as non-
<div n="lb"/>Aryan, as the Andhras certainly seem to have been.<sup>2</sup>
<F>1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18; Śāṅkh-
<div n="lb"/>āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 26, where
<div n="lb"/>instead of {%udāntyaḥ%} (‘beyond the
<div n="lb"/>borders’) the reading is {%udañcaḥ%} (‘nor-
<div n="lb"/>thern’), but the former is obviously
<div n="lb"/>correct. The Sāṅkhāyana omits the
<div n="lb"/>Pulindas, and has Mūcīpas.</F>
