{@Viśvā-mitra@}¦ (‘friend of all’) is the name of a Ṛṣi who is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and to whom the third Maṇḍala is
<div n="lb"/>attributed by tradition. In one hymn<sup>2</sup> which appears to be his
<div n="lb"/>own composition, he praises the rivers {@Vipāś@} (Beas) and
<div n="lb"/>{@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of {@Kuśika,@}
<div n="lb"/>and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the {@Bharatas,@}
<div n="lb"/>whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently
<div n="lb"/>came to the rivers from the east.<sup>4</sup> Anxious to cross them, they
<div n="P"/>^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5.
[Page2-311+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>found them in high flood, but Viśvāmitra by prayer induced
<div n="lb"/>the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred
<div n="lb"/>to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Curiously enough, Sāyaṇa<sup>6</sup> quite misunderstands the situation:
<div n="lb"/>according to him, Viśvāmitra having obtained wealth by the
<div n="lb"/>exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pur-
<div n="lb"/>sued by others. Yāska's<sup>7</sup> version of the tale merely seems
<div n="lb"/>to mean that the king paid Viśvāmitra to act as his {@Puro-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@hita,@} or domestic priest. For the relations of Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>to Vasiṣṭha connected with their service of {@Sudās, see@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vasiṣṭha.@}
<div n="P"/>The Viśvāmitras are mentioned in several other passages of
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> and are also designated as a family by the term
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuśikas.@}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later literature Viśvāmitra becomes, like Vasiṣṭha, a
<div n="lb"/>mythical sage, usually<sup>10</sup> mentioned in connection with {@Jamad-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@agni;@} he was Hotṛ priest at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} whom
<div n="lb"/>he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of {@Devarāta.@}<sup>11</sup> He
<div n="lb"/>was a protégé of Indra, with whom he had an interview
<div n="lb"/>according to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas.<sup>12</sup> He is also often
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as a Ṛṣi.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Epic<sup>14</sup> Viśvāmitra is represented as a king, who
<div n="lb"/>becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, but the Nirukta<sup>15</sup> calls his father, Kuśika, a king; the
[Page2-312+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> refers to Śunaḥśepa as succeeding to
<div n="lb"/>the lordship of the {@Jahnus,@} as well as the ‘divine lore’ ({%daiva%}
<div n="lb"/>{%veda%}) of the {@Gāthins;@} and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions Viśvāmitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of
<div n="lb"/>this kingship of Viśvāmitra: it may probably be dismissed as a
<div n="lb"/>mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even
<div n="lb"/>this is doubtful.

<F>2) iii. 33. Ludwig, Translation of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, 3, 121, thinks the hymn too
<div n="lb"/>poetical to be a real composition of the
<div n="lb"/>reputed author.</F>
<F>4) So Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 3, 152.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 127, 128,
<div n="lb"/>takes a different view: with Roth, {%Zur%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda,%} 90,
<div n="lb"/>he assumes that the Bharatas were
<div n="lb"/>different from the Tṛtsus, and that they
<div n="lb"/>came under Viśvāmitra from the West,
<div n="lb"/>but were defeated (see Rv. vii. 33, 6).
