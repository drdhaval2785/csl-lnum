{@Try-aruṇa Trai-vṛṣṇa Trasadasyu@}¦ is the name of a prince
<div n="lb"/>whose generosity to a singer is celebrated in a hymn of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he appears as
<div n="lb"/>{@Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka,@} and is the hero of the
<div n="lb"/>following story. He was out in his chariot with his Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>or domestic priest, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} and by excessive speed in driving
<div n="lb"/>killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Puro-
<div n="lb"/>hita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The Śāṭyāyana Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, cited by Sāyaṇa,<sup>3</sup> elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had
<div n="lb"/>held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder.
<div n="lb"/>The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the
<div n="lb"/>crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa
<div n="lb"/>Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs — being
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas they were partial to a Kṣatriya — Agni's glow ceased
<div n="lb"/>to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore
<div n="lb"/>it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the
<div n="lb"/>form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded
<div n="lb"/>in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations
<div n="lb"/>occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> which connects the story with
<div n="lb"/>a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> Sieg's attempt<sup>6</sup> to show that the
<div n="lb"/>hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful.<sup>7</sup>
[Page1-333+ 44]
<div n="P"/>It is clear that Trasadasyu must here mean ‘descendant of
<div n="lb"/>Trasadasyu,’ and not King Trasadasyu himself. The difference
<div n="lb"/>of the patronymics, Traivṛṣṇa and Traidhātva, by which he is
<div n="lb"/>referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were
<div n="lb"/>two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan),
<div n="lb"/>from whom Tryaruṇa was descended.<sup>8</sup> The connexion with the
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvākus is important (see {@Ikṣvāku@}).
