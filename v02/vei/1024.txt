{@Jarā-bodha,@}¦ a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>of doubtful meaning. It is held by Ludwig<sup>2</sup> to be the name of
[Page1-278+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>a seer. Roth<sup>3</sup> regards it as a mere adjective meaning ‘attending
<div n="lb"/>to the invocation,’ which is perhaps the most probable inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretation. Oldenburg,<sup>4</sup> however, thinks that the word is a
<div n="lb"/>proper name, the literal sense being ‘alert in old age.’
