<div n="lb"/>tion cited by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Aitareya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>1</sup> which discriminates Sarpis as the liquid and Ghṛta as
<div n="lb"/>the solid condition of the butter. The word is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> and later.<sup>3</sup>
