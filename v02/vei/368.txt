{@Upama-śravas@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>a son of {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} and grandson of {@Medhātithi.@} The
<div n="lb"/>exact force of the reference to him in however, uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>According to the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>2</sup> followed by Ludwig,<sup>3</sup> and by
<div n="lb"/>Lanman,<sup>4</sup> the poet in the hymn consoles Upamaśravas for the
<div n="lb"/>death of his grandfather, Medhātithi. Geldner,<sup>5</sup> on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, thinks that the poet, who was {@Kavaṣa Ailūṣa,@} was
<div n="lb"/>ill-treated by his patron's son, Upamaśravas, and cast into
<div n="lb"/>a ditch or well, where he uttered his complaint and appeal for
<div n="lb"/>mercy. But of this there is no adequate evidence, and the
<div n="lb"/>tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā seems sound.
