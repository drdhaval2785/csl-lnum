{@Śūdra@}¦ is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>state (see {@Varṇa@}). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except
<div n="lb"/>in the Puruṣasūkta<sup>1</sup> (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla,
<div n="lb"/>where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the
<div n="lb"/>Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, knows {@Dasyu@} and {@Dāsa,@} both as aborigines independent
<div n="lb"/>of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to
<div n="lb"/>reckon the Śūdra of the later texts as belonging to the
<div n="lb"/>aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans.
<div n="lb"/>Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been
<div n="lb"/>regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions
<div n="lb"/>when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred
<div n="lb"/>quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be
<div n="lb"/>used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the
<div n="lb"/>aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan
<div n="lb"/>lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in
<div n="lb"/>Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early
<div n="lb"/>cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, the term Śūdra would also cover the wild hill tribes
<div n="lb"/>which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would
<div n="lb"/>acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it
<div n="lb"/>could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>state.
<div n="P"/>This view of the Śūdra suits adequately the Vedic references
<div n="lb"/>to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic
<div n="lb"/>slaves only. The Śūdra is continually opposed to the Āryan,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the colour of the Śūdra is compared with that of the
<div n="lb"/>Āryan,<sup>3</sup> just as his ways are so contrasted.<sup>4</sup> The Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> in its account of the castes, declares that the
[Page2-389+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra is {%anyasya preṣya,%} ‘the servant of another’; {%kāmotthāpya,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘to be expelled at will’; and {%yathākāmavadhya,%} ‘to be slain at
<div n="lb"/>will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the
<div n="lb"/>serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been
<div n="lb"/>applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with
<div n="lb"/>but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a
<div n="lb"/>grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>6</sup> explains that even if prosperous ({%bahu-paśu,%} ‘having
<div n="lb"/>many cows’) a Śūdra could not be other than a servant: his
<div n="lb"/>business was {%pādāvanejya,%} ‘the washing of the feet’ of his
<div n="lb"/>superiors. The Mahābhārata<sup>7</sup> says out and out that a Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>has no property ({%na hi svam asti śūdrasya,%} ‘the Śūdra has
<div n="lb"/>nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in
<div n="lb"/>England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and
<div n="lb"/>limb,<sup>8</sup> so it appears that the slaying of a Śūdra involved a
<div n="lb"/>wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudhāyana<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Āpastamba.<sup>10</sup> It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was
<div n="lb"/>only due in case of murder by another than the master, but
<div n="lb"/>such limitation is nowhere stated.
<div n="P"/>In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and {@Śūdra@}
<div n="lb"/>was, of course, specially marked. The texts<sup>11</sup> do not hesitate
<div n="lb"/>to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras;
<div n="lb"/>the Śūdra is prohibited<sup>12</sup> from milking the cow for the milk
<div n="lb"/>required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> forbids a man who has been consecrated
<div n="lb"/>({%dīkṣita%}) for a sacrifice to speak to a Śūdra at all for the time,
<div n="lb"/>though the Śāṭyāyanaka<sup>14</sup> seems to have relaxed this rule by
<div n="lb"/>confining it to cases in which the Śūdra was guilty of some sin.
[Page2-390+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>At the sacrifice itself the Śūdra could not be present in the
<div n="lb"/>{%śālā,%} ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>máṇa<sup>15</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> as unfit for ‘sacrifice’
<div n="lb"/>({%ayajñiya%}); and declared in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> not to be
<div n="lb"/>admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory
<div n="lb"/>Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact
<div n="lb"/>with a Śūdra,<sup>18</sup> who here, as in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, the Śūdra is one of the victims at the Puruṣa-
<div n="lb"/>medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>19</sup> and a fight
<div n="lb"/>between an Āryan and a Śūdra, in which, of course, the former
<div n="lb"/>wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a pre-
<div n="lb"/>cursor of the Indian drama.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be
<div n="lb"/>undesirable to ignore the real importance of the Śūdra, which
<div n="lb"/>again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though
<div n="lb"/>legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a
<div n="lb"/>free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts,<sup>21</sup> just
<div n="lb"/>as Śūdra {%gahapatis,%} ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts,
<div n="lb"/>and Śūdra kings in the legal literature.<sup>22</sup> Sin against Śūdra and
<div n="lb"/>Āryan is mentioned;<sup>23</sup> prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras,
<div n="lb"/>as well as of the other castes<sup>24</sup> occur; and the desire to be dear
<div n="lb"/>to Śūdra as well as to Āryan is expressed.<sup>25</sup>
[Page2-391+ 71]
<div n="P"/>The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules
<div n="lb"/>points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in
<div n="lb"/>sitting, etc.,<sup>26</sup> their exclusion from the study of the Vedas,<sup>27</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the danger of contact with them<sup>28</sup> or their food,<sup>29</sup> still recog-
<div n="lb"/>nize that Śūdras can be merchants,<sup>30</sup> or even exercise any
<div n="lb"/>trade.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the Sūtras<sup>32</sup> permit the marriage of a Śūdrā
<div n="lb"/>woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach
<div n="lb"/>to {@Vatsa@}<sup>33</sup> and to {@Kavaṣa@}<sup>34</sup> that they were the sons of a Śūdrā
<div n="lb"/>and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach
<div n="lb"/>shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>illicit unions of Ārya and Śūdrā, or Śūdra and Āryā, are
<div n="lb"/>referred to in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the term Śūdra is quite obscure, but Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>points out that Ptolemy<sup>37</sup> mentions <lang n="greek">Σύδροι</lang> as a people, and he
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any
<div n="lb"/>stress on this identification,<sup>38</sup> it is reasonable to accept the
[Page2-392+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>view<sup>39</sup> that the term was originally the name of a large tribe
<div n="lb"/>opposed to the Āryan invasion. See also {@Niṣāda.@}

<F>38) The Brāhui are now held not to be
<div n="lb"/>Dravidian ethnologically, but Turco-
<div n="lb"/>Iranian ({%Indian Empire,%} 1, 292, 310).
<div n="lb"/>It is suggested ({%ibid.,%} 1, 382) that they
<div n="lb"/>represent the original Dravidian type,
<div n="lb"/>which in India has been merged in the
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍā type; but this suggestion is
<div n="lb"/>invalidated by the fact that the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>speaks of the Dasyus as {%anās,%} ‘nose-
<div n="lb"/>less’ ({%cf.%} {@Dasyu,@} 1, 347, n. 7). a term
<div n="lb"/>admirably applicable to Dravidians,
<div n="lb"/>but ludicrous as applied to the Turco-
<div n="lb"/>Iranian type. It is much more plausible
<div n="lb"/>to assume that the Brāhuis are a mixed
<div n="lb"/>race, which in course of time has lost
<div n="lb"/>most of its Dravidian features. On
<div n="lb"/>the relation of Dravidians and speakers
<div n="lb"/>of Muṇḍā tongues, the Vedic texts
<div n="lb"/>throw no light.</F>
