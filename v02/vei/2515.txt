{@Mṛga-vyādha,@}¦ ‘the hunter,’ is the name of Sirius in the
<div n="lb"/>legend of Prajāpati's daughter in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati (Orion) pursues his daughter (Rohiṇī), and is shot
<div n="lb"/>by the archer Sirius. The transference of the legend of
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati to the sky is no doubt secondary, caused by the
<div n="lb"/>obvious similarity of the constellation in question to the idea
<div n="lb"/>of an archer.
