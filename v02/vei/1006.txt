{@Janaka,@}¦ king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as well as in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup> He was a contemporary of {@Yājñavalkya Vāja-@}
[Page1-272+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>{@saneya,@}<sup>5</sup> of {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@} and of other sages.<sup>6</sup> He had
<div n="lb"/>become famous for his generosity and his interest in the dis-
<div n="lb"/>cussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality,
<div n="lb"/>in the life-time of {@Ajātaśatru@} of Kāśi.<sup>7</sup> It is significant that
<div n="lb"/>he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru-Pañcālas, such as Yājñavalkya and Śvetaketu; for this
<div n="lb"/>indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads
<div n="lb"/>was in the Kuru-Pañcāla country rather than in the east.
<div n="lb"/>There is a statement in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> that he
<div n="lb"/>became a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}). This does not, however, signify
<div n="lb"/>a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin (see {@Kṣatriya@}). Janaka is occasionally mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in later texts: in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> he has already
<div n="lb"/>become quite mythical; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a {%sapta-rātra%} or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him.
<div n="P"/>It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a con-
<div n="lb"/>temporary of Ajātaśatru, and by identifying the latter with the
<div n="lb"/>Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts:<sup>11</sup> this would make the end of the
<div n="lb"/>sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka.<sup>12</sup> But it is
<div n="lb"/>very doubtful whether this identification can be supported:
<div n="lb"/>Ajātaśatru was king of Kāśi, whereas Ajātasattu was king of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha, and his only connexion with Kāśi was through his
<div n="lb"/>marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala.<sup>13</sup> More-
<div n="lb"/>over, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to
<div n="lb"/>reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for
<div n="lb"/>it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism.<sup>14</sup> Nor do the Vedic texts know
<div n="lb"/>anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes
<div n="lb"/>famed in Buddhist records.
[Page1-273+ 54]
<div n="P"/>The identification<sup>15</sup> of Janaka of Videha and the father of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is
<div n="lb"/>somewhat doubtful. In the Sūtras Janaka appears as an
<div n="lb"/>ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less
<div n="lb"/>respected than later.<sup>16</sup>
