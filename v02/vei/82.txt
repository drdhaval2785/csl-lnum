{@Apa-cit.@}¦ — This word occurs several times in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It is held by Roth,<sup>2</sup> Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> and others to denote an insect
<div n="lb"/>whose sting produced swellings, etc. ({%glau%}). But Bloomfield<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>shows that the disease, scrofulous swellings, is what is really
<div n="lb"/>meant, as is shown by the rendering ({%gaṇḍa-mālā,%} ‘inflammation
<div n="lb"/>of the glands of the neck’) of Keśava and Sāyaṇa, and by the
<div n="lb"/>parallelism of the later disease, {%apacī,%} the derivation being from
<div n="lb"/>{%apa%} and {%ci,%} ‘to pick off.’
