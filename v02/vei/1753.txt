2. {@Pastyā-vant@}¦ occurs in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>locative parallel with {@Suṣoma, Śaryaṇāvant,@} and {@Ārjīka.@} It
<div n="lb"/>must apparently denote a place, as Pischel<sup>2</sup> argues, probably
<div n="lb"/>corresponding to the locality ‘in the middle of the streams’
<div n="lb"/>({%madhye pastyānām%}), elsewhere<sup>3</sup> referred to as the home of Soma.
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>4</sup> suggests that Patiāla is meant, though he does not lay
<div n="lb"/>any stress on the similarity of name. In the north of Patiāla
<div n="lb"/>there are hills where the Soma might have grown. Roth<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thought that something connected with the Soma press was
<div n="lb"/>meant.

<div n="lb"/>Max Müller, {%Sacred Books of the East,%}
<div n="lb"/>32, 260, 398, 399, takes Pastyāvant
<div n="lb"/>as a place-name, but thinks that {%pastyā%}
<div n="lb"/>denotes ‘hamlet,’ or, as an epithet of
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, refers to her as a ‘housewife’
<div n="lb"/>(Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5).</F>
