{@Upa-mit@}¦ occurs twice in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and once in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> as the designation of some part of a house. The
<div n="lb"/>passages in the Rigveda leave little doubt that the word means
<div n="lb"/>an upright pillar. As it is, in the Atharvaveda, coupled with
<div n="lb"/>{@Parimit@} and {@Pratimit,@} the conclusion is natural that the latter
<div n="lb"/>word denotes the beams supporting the Upamit, presumably by
<div n="lb"/>leaning against it at an angle, while {@Parimit@} denotes the beams
<div n="lb"/>connecting the Upamits horizontally. These interpretations,
<div n="lb"/>however, can only be conjectural. See also {@Gṛha.@}
