{@Sarayu@}¦ is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda as the name of
<div n="lb"/>river. {@Citraratha@} and Arṇa are said to have been defeated
<div n="lb"/>apparently by the {@Turvaśas@} and {@Yadus@} who crossed the
[Page2-434+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>Sarayu.<sup>1</sup> Sarayu appears in one passage with {@Sarasvatī@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Sindhu,@}<sup>2</sup> and in another with {@Rasā, Anitabhā,@} and {@Kubha.@}<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Later, in the post-Vedic period, Sarayū, rarely Sarayu, is the
<div n="lb"/>name of a river in Oudh, the modern Sarjū.<sup>4</sup> Zimmer<sup>5</sup> regards
<div n="lb"/>this as the river meant in all the Vedic passages, seeing in the
<div n="lb"/>last,<sup>3</sup> which may be used as an argument for locating the
<div n="lb"/>Sarayu in the Panjab, a reference to the north-east monsoon as
<div n="lb"/>well as to the usual monsoon from the west. Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks
<div n="lb"/>that the Sarayu is to be found in the west, and Ludwig<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>identifies it with the Kurum ({@Krumu@}). Vivien de St. Martin
<div n="lb"/>considered it to be probably identical with the united course of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej) and {@Vipāś@} (Beas).
<F>1) iv. 30, 18. This passage gives no
<div n="lb"/>help, because the possibility is open
<div n="lb"/>either to suppose that the Turvaśa,
<div n="lb"/>Yadu are not mentioned as defeating
<div n="lb"/>the Āryans Citraratha and Arṇa; or,
<div n="lb"/>if they are, to suppose that they may
<div n="lb"/>have come east against the two.</F>

<F>4) This is a tributary joining the
<div n="lb"/>Gogrā, the great river of Oudh, on
<div n="lb"/>the left of its upper course. The name
<div n="lb"/>Sarjū is also applied to the Gogrā itself
<div n="lb"/>below {@Bahrāmghāt.@} A branch of the
<div n="lb"/>Lower Gogrā, given off on the right,
<div n="lb"/>flowing in an old bed of the Gogrā,
<div n="lb"/>and falling into the Ganges after passing
<div n="lb"/>Balliā, is called the Chhotī (Lesser)
<div n="lb"/>Sarjū. {%Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India,%}
