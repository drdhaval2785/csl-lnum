{@Sabhā-sad,@}¦ ‘sitter in the assembly,’ is probably a technical
<div n="lb"/>description of the assessors who decided legal cases in the
<div n="lb"/>assembly ({%cf.%} {@Sabhācara@}). The term, which is found in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> cannot well merely denote any member
<div n="lb"/>of the assembly. It is also possible that the Sabhāsads, perhaps
<div n="lb"/>the heads of families, were expected to be present at the Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>oftener than the ordinary man: the meetings of the assembly
<div n="lb"/>for justice may have been more frequent than for general discus-
<div n="lb"/>sion and decision.
