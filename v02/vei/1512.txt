{@Nanāndṛ@}¦ is a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where it denotes, according to Sāyaṇa, the ‘husband's sister,’
<div n="lb"/>over whom the wife is to rule. This interpretation is confirmed
<div n="lb"/>by the fact that the same position is ascribed to the husband's
<div n="lb"/>sister — no doubt while unmarried and living in her brother's
<div n="lb"/>care — by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup>

<div n="lb"/>{%Verwandtschaftsnamen,%} 516. The native
<div n="lb"/>lexicographers recognize the word,
<div n="lb"/>though its occurrence in the later
<div n="lb"/>literature is very rare (it has been
<div n="lb"/>noted in the Uttararāmacarita). See
