{@Vrātya@}¦ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>1</sup> where, however, no
<div n="lb"/>further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information
<div n="lb"/>is furnished by the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Sūtras.<sup>4</sup> which describe at length a certain rite intended
<div n="lb"/>for the use of Vrātyas. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’ — viz., the
<div n="lb"/>{%hīna,%} who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have
<div n="lb"/>become outcasts for some sin ({%nindita%}); those who become out-
<div n="lb"/>casts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and
<div n="lb"/>those old men who, being impotent ({%śama-nīcameḍhra%}), have
<div n="lb"/>gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no
<div n="lb"/>means of the same importance as the first. The motive of
<div n="lb"/>the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām-
[Page2-343+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>krishṇa Bhāgavat,<sup>5</sup> they were men who had enfeebled their
<div n="lb"/>constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of
<div n="lb"/>the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But
<div n="lb"/>this is not stated in the text.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were
<div n="lb"/>those referred to as {%hīna,%} and that the other classes were only
<div n="lb"/>subsidiary. According to Rājārām,<sup>6</sup> there were two categories
<div n="lb"/>of the first class: ({%a%}) The depressed ({%hīna%}), who were non-
<div n="lb"/>Āryan; and ({%b%}) degraded Āryans ({%gara-gir%}). This, however, is
<div n="lb"/>a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have
<div n="lb"/>been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is
<div n="lb"/>not probable, for it is expressly said<sup>7</sup> that, though unconse-
<div n="lb"/>crated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were
<div n="lb"/>thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the state-
<div n="lb"/>ment that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to
<div n="lb"/>utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of
<div n="lb"/>speech ({%cf.%} {@Vāc@}). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’)
<div n="lb"/>and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya.
<div n="P"/>Other particulars accord with the view that they were
<div n="lb"/>Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they
<div n="lb"/>are said<sup>8</sup> not to practise agriculture or commerce (an
<div n="lb"/>allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of
<div n="lb"/>{@Brahmacarya@} — {%i.e.,%} the principle regulating the Brahminic
<div n="lb"/>order of life. They were also allowed to become members
<div n="lb"/>of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual
<div n="lb"/>prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case
<div n="lb"/>of non-Āryans.
<div n="P"/>Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas.
<div n="lb"/>Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they
<div n="lb"/>beat those unworthy of correction.<sup>9</sup> Their leder (Gṛhapati) or
<div n="lb"/>householder wore a turban ({@Uṣṇīṣa@}), carried a whip ({@Pratoda@}),
<div n="lb"/>a kind of bow ({@Jyāhroḍa@}), was clothed in a black ({%kṛṣṇaśa%})
<div n="lb"/>garment and two skins ({@Ajina@}), black and white ({%kṛṣṇa-valakṣa%}),
<div n="lb"/>and owned a rough wagon ({@Vipatha@}) covered with planks
[Page2-344+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>({%phalakāstīrṇa%}). The others,<sup>10</sup> subordinate to the leader, had
<div n="lb"/>garments with fringes of red ({%valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi%}), two
<div n="lb"/>fringes on each, skins folded double ({%dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni%}), and
<div n="lb"/>sandals ({@Upānah@}). The leader wore also an ornament ({@Niṣka@})
<div n="lb"/>of silver, which Rājārām<sup>11</sup> converts into a silver coinage. The
<div n="lb"/>Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over
<div n="lb"/>their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras ({%e.g.,%} that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black
<div n="lb"/>hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with
<div n="lb"/>certainty, but their nomad life<sup>12</sup> suggests the western tribes
<div n="lb"/>beyond the Sarasvatī. But they may equally well have been in
<div n="lb"/>the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's
<div n="lb"/>outfit an inhabitant of {@Magadha.@} The Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> does not
<div n="lb"/>help, for it treats the Vrātya in so mystical a way that he is
<div n="lb"/>represented as being in all the quarters. Indeed, Roth<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>believed that it was here not a case of the Vrātya of the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa at all, but of a glorification of the Vrātya as
<div n="lb"/>the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant
<div n="lb"/>({@Parivrājaka@}). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence
<div n="lb"/>of the words {%uṣṇīsa, vipatha,%} and {%pratoaa%} shows. It is probable
<div n="lb"/>that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the
<div n="lb"/>Vrātya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted
<div n="lb"/>Vrātya as a type of the perfect {@Brahmicārin,@} and, in so far, of
<div n="lb"/>the divinity.<sup>15</sup>
