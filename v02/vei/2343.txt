{@Madhyama-vah@}¦ occurs in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as an
<div n="lb"/>epithet of the chariot. The exact interpretation is doubtful.
<div n="lb"/>Roth<sup>2</sup> assigns to it the expression the sense of ‘driving with a
<div n="lb"/>single horse between the shafts.’ According to Sāyana's
<div n="lb"/>explanation, it means ‘driving with middling speed.’ It might
<div n="lb"/>mean ‘driving in the middle’ — that is, ‘only half-way.’^3

<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} Oldenberg, {%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} 1, 210.
<div n="lb"/>The context seems to require the sense
<div n="lb"/>of ‘keeping away’ from the sacrifice.
