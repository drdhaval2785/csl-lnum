{@Iriṇa@}¦ (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas<sup>2</sup> in the sense of ‘a cleft in the ground,’ usually
<div n="lb"/>natural ({%sva-kṛta%}). The same meaning is also, as Pischel<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>shows, to be ascribed to it in three passages of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in one<sup>5</sup> of which the hole is referred to as ‘made by water’
<div n="lb"/>({%apā kṛtam%}). In another passage of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the word
<div n="lb"/>refers to the place on which the dice are thrown. Hence
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>7</sup> concludes that the dicing-board must have been
<div n="lb"/>so called because it contained holes into which the dice had
<div n="lb"/>to be thrown if possible. Lüders,<sup>8</sup> however, points out that
<div n="lb"/>this assumption is not necessary; the dice ({@Akṣa@}) were merely
<div n="lb"/>thrown on a space dug out, which could be called {@Iriṇa,@} as
<div n="lb"/>being a hole in the ground, though not a natural one. This
<div n="lb"/>view is supported by the commentary of Sāyaṇa,<sup>9</sup> as well as
<div n="lb"/>by Durga in his note on the Nirukta.<sup>10</sup>
