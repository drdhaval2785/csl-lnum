{@Ratha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes ‘chariot’ as
<div n="lb"/>opposed to {@Anas,@} ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute.
<div n="lb"/>Of differences in the structure of the two we have no informa-
<div n="lb"/>tion, except that the {@Kha,@} or nave hole, in the wheel of the
<div n="lb"/>chariot was greater than in that of the cart.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels ({@Cakra@}), to which
<div n="lb"/>reference is frequently made.<sup>4</sup> The wheel consisted of a rim
<div n="lb"/>({@Pavi@}), a felly ({@Pradhi@}), spokes ({@Ara@}),<sup>5</sup> and a nave ({@Nabhya@}).
<div n="lb"/>The rim and the felly together constitute the {@Nemi.@} The hole
<div n="lb"/>in the nave is called {@Kha:@} into it the end of the axle was
<div n="lb"/>inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether {@Āṇi@} denotes
<div n="lb"/>the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the
<div n="lb"/>lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes
<div n="lb"/>a solid wheel was used.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>The axle ({@Akṣa@}) was, in some cases, made of {@Araṭu@} wood;<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached
<div n="lb"/>the body of the chariot ({@Kośa@}). This part is also denoted by
<div n="lb"/>the word {@Vandhura,@} which more precisely means the ‘seat’
<div n="lb"/>of the chariot. The epithet {%tri-vandhura%} is used of the chariot
<div n="lb"/>of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its
<div n="lb"/>epithets, {%tri-cakra:%} perhaps, as Weber<sup>8</sup> thinks, a chariot with
<div n="lb"/>three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>9</sup> considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. {@Garta@}
<div n="lb"/>also denotes the seat of the warrior.
[Page2-202+ 61]
<div n="P"/>At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot ({@Īṣā,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Praüga@}). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either
<div n="lb"/>side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke ({@Yuga@}) being
<div n="lb"/>laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole
<div n="lb"/>in the yoke (called Kha<sup>10</sup> or Tardman),<sup>11</sup> the yoke and the pole
<div n="lb"/>then being tied together.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The horses were tied by the neck ({%grīvā%}), where the yoke was
<div n="lb"/>placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened
<div n="lb"/>to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the
<div n="lb"/>ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably
<div n="lb"/>should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to
<div n="lb"/>a point at the tip.<sup>13</sup> The traces seem to be denoted by {@Raśmi@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Raśanā.@} These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were
<div n="lb"/>fastened to the bit (perhaps {%śiprā%}) in the horse's mouth. The
<div n="lb"/>driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with
<div n="lb"/>a whip ({%Kaśā%}).<sup>14</sup> The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but
<div n="lb"/>three or four<sup>16</sup> were often used. It is uncertain whether, in
<div n="lb"/>these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the
<div n="lb"/>side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could
<div n="lb"/>be employed.<sup>17</sup> Horses were normally used for chariots, but
<div n="lb"/>the ass ({%gardabha%})<sup>18</sup> or mule ({%aśvatarī%})<sup>19</sup> are also mentioned.
<div n="lb"/>The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its
[Page2-203+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>name, {@Anaḍvāh,@} from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to
<div n="lb"/>be content with a single steed, which then ran between two
<div n="lb"/>shafts.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the
<div n="lb"/>warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, {@Savyeṣṭha@} or
<div n="lb"/>{@Savyaṣṭhā,@}<sup>21</sup> He could also sit when he wanted, for the
<div n="lb"/>chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit
<div n="lb"/>while shooting his arrows.
<div n="P"/>The dimensions of the chariot are given in the Śulba Sūtra<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>of Āpastamba at 188 Aṅgulis (finger-breadths) for the pole,
<div n="lb"/>104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in
<div n="lb"/>its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names
<div n="lb"/>being often obscure in meaning: see {@Aṅka, Nyaṅka, Uddhi,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Pakṣas, Pātalya, Bhurij, Rathopastha, Rathavāhana.@}
