{@Dāya@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> only in the sense of ‘reward’
<div n="lb"/>of exertion ({%śrama%}), but later it means ‘inheritance’ — that is,
<div n="lb"/>a father's property which is to be divided among his sons
<div n="lb"/>either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all
<div n="lb"/>negative the idea that the property of the family was legally
<div n="lb"/>family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head
<div n="lb"/>of the house, usually the father, and that the other members
<div n="lb"/>of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father
<div n="lb"/>could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they
<div n="lb"/>were physically stronger.
<div n="P"/>Thus {@Manu@} is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> to have divided
<div n="lb"/>his property among his sons. He omitted {@Nābhānediṣṭha,@}
[Page1-352+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and
<div n="lb"/>to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the
<div n="lb"/>property he divided was movable property, rather than land
<div n="lb"/>({@Urvarā@}). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the division is said to
<div n="lb"/>have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left
<div n="lb"/>only their aged father to Nābhānediṣṭha. According to the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> again, four sons divided the inheritance
<div n="lb"/>while their old father, Abhipratārin, was still alive. It is,
<div n="lb"/>of course, possible to regard Dāya as denoting the heritable
<div n="lb"/>property of the family, but the developed {%patria potestas%} of the
<div n="lb"/>father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend
<div n="lb"/>of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} is inconsistent with the view that the sons
<div n="lb"/>were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they
<div n="lb"/>actually insisted on a division of the property.<sup>5</sup> Probably — 
<div n="lb"/>there is no evidence of any decisive character — land was not
<div n="lb"/>divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the
<div n="lb"/>analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the
<div n="lb"/>available supply of arable land became limited.
<div n="P"/>As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps
[Page1-353+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>this was always the case after death. During the father's life-
<div n="lb"/>time another might be preferred, as appears from a passage
<div n="lb"/>of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup> Women were excluded from
<div n="lb"/>partition or inheritance, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Nirukta.<sup>9</sup> They were, no doubt, supported by their
<div n="lb"/>brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prosti-
<div n="lb"/>tution.<sup>10</sup> Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Sūtras.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The heir is called Dayada,<sup>12</sup> ‘receiver ({%ā-da%}) of inheritance.’

<div n="lb"/>Jolly, {%Recht und Sitte,%} 93-96, does not
<div n="lb"/>accept the communal ownership of land,
<div n="lb"/>but, {%ibid.,%} 80, is inclined to believe in
<div n="lb"/>the joint ownership of a family. He
<div n="lb"/>admits that this is inconsistent with the
<div n="lb"/>strict rule of {%patria potestas,%} which still
<div n="lb"/>exists in Bengal; Baden Powell, {%Village%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Communities in India,%} 133 {%et seq.,%} doubts
<div n="lb"/>the existence in early India of such a
<div n="lb"/>{%patria potestas.%} But the facts seem clearly
<div n="lb"/>to show that there was such a power,
<div n="lb"/>and that the father owned the property.
<div n="lb"/>His sons, as they grew up, came to
<div n="lb"/>claim the property, and he might have
<div n="lb"/>to divide it; hence the idea naturally
<div n="lb"/>developed that every child on birth had
<div n="lb"/>a legal share in the property. No doubt
<div n="lb"/>also from the first the right to part with
<div n="lb"/>land was one which grown-up sons and
<div n="lb"/>the rest of the community could object
<div n="lb"/>to, once the village had acquired a fixed
<div n="lb"/>existence. This would account ade-
<div n="lb"/>quately for the later system. {%Cf.%} also
