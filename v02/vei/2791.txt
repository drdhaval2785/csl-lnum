{@Vadhrimatī,@}¦ ‘having an impotent man as a husband,’ seems
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> to be the name of a woman who owed the
<div n="lb"/>restoration of her husband's virility to the Aśvins, and obtained
<div n="lb"/>a son, {@Hiraṇyahasta.@} The word is, however, possibly only
<div n="lb"/>descriptive.
