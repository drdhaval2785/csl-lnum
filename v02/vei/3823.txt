{@Hemanta,@}¦ ‘winter,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but
<div n="lb"/>often in the later texts.<sup>2</sup> Zimmer<sup>3</sup> is inclined to trace
<div n="lb"/>differences of climate in the Rigveda: he thinks that certain
<div n="lb"/>hymns,<sup>4</sup> which ignore winter and insist on the rains, indicate a
<div n="lb"/>different place and time of origin from those which refer to the
<div n="lb"/>snowy mountains.<sup>5</sup> It is, however, quite impossible to separate
<div n="lb"/>parts of the Rigveda on this basis. It is probable that that
<div n="lb"/>text owes its composition in the main to residents in the later
<div n="lb"/>{@Madhyadeśa;@} hence the references to cold and snow are rather
<div n="lb"/>a sign of local than of temporal differences. It is otherwise
<div n="lb"/>with the later expansion of the three into four seasons,
[Page2-508+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>which represents clearly the earlier advance of the Indians
<div n="lb"/>(see {@Ṛtu@}).
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> describes winter as the time
<div n="lb"/>when the plants wither, the leaves fall from the trees, the birds
<div n="lb"/>fly low and retire more and more.
