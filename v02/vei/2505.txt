{@Mūjavant@}¦ is the name of a people who, along with the
<div n="lb"/>{@Mahāvṛṣas,@} the {@Gandhāris,@} and the {@Balhikas,@} are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as dwelling far away, and to whom
<div n="lb"/>fever is to be banished. Similarly in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the Mūjavants are chosen as a type of distant folk, beyond
[Page2-170+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>which Rudra with his bow is entreated to depart. In the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>3</sup> Soma is described as Maujavata, ‘coming from the
<div n="lb"/>Mūjavants,’ or, as Yāska<sup>4</sup> takes it, ‘from Mount Mūjavant.’
<div n="lb"/>The Indian commentators<sup>5</sup> agree with Yāska in taking Mūja-
<div n="lb"/>vant as the name of a mountain, and though Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>justified in saying that the identification of Mūjavant by
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>7</sup> with one of the lower hills on the south-west of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśmīr lacks evidence, it is not reasonable to deny that
<div n="lb"/>Mūjavant was a hill from which the people took their name.
<div n="lb"/>Yāska<sup>8</sup> suggests that Mūjavant is equivalent to Muñjavant,
<div n="lb"/>which actually occurs later, in the Epic,<sup>9</sup> as the name of a
<div n="lb"/>mountain in the Himālaya.
