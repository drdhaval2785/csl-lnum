{@Avi.@}¦ — ‘Sheep’ are repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda, and
<div n="lb"/>later, often in conjunction with goats ({%aja%}). The wolf ({%vṛka%})
<div n="lb"/>was their great enemy,<sup>1</sup> and they were tended by shepherds.<sup>2</sup>
[Page1-041+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>Sheep as well as kine were captured from the enemy.<sup>3</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Soma sieve was made of sheep's wool, and is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>referred to ({%avi, meṣī, avya, avyaya%}).<sup>4</sup> Considerable herds
<div n="lb"/>must have existed, as Ṛjrāśva is said<sup>5</sup> to have slain one
<div n="lb"/>hundred rams, and in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’)<sup>6</sup> a hundred
<div n="lb"/>sheep are mentioned as a gift. The ({%meṣa,%}<sup>7</sup> {%vṛṣṇi%}<sup>8</sup> ) ram was
<div n="lb"/>sometimes castrated ({%petva%}).<sup>9</sup> The main use of sheep was their
<div n="lb"/>wool; hence the expression ‘woolly’ ({%ūrṇāvatī%})<sup>10</sup> is employed to
<div n="lb"/>designate a sheep. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> the ram is
<div n="lb"/>described as ‘woolly,’ and as ‘the skin of beasts, quadruped and
<div n="lb"/>biped,’ with reference to the use of its wool as clothing for men
<div n="lb"/>and shelter for animals. Pūṣan is said<sup>12</sup> to weave raiment from
<div n="lb"/>the wool of sheep. Normally the sheep stayed out at pasture;
<div n="lb"/>in an obscure passage of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> reference appears to be
<div n="lb"/>made to rams in stall. Gandhāra<sup>14</sup> ewes were famous for their
<div n="lb"/>wool. Pischel<sup>15</sup> considers that the {@Paruṣṇī@}<sup>16</sup> was named from
<div n="lb"/>its richness in sheep, {%parus%}<sup>17</sup> denoting the ‘flocks’ of wool.
