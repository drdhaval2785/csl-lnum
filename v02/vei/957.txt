{@Camū@}¦ is a term of somewhat doubtful sense occurring
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation
<div n="lb"/>of Soma. Zimmer<sup>1</sup> considers that in the dual it denotes the
<div n="lb"/>two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was
<div n="lb"/>crushed ({%cf.%} {@Adhiṣavaṇa@}). Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, appears to be right
<div n="lb"/>in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the
<div n="lb"/>Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> shows
<div n="lb"/>clearly that when it occurs in the plural<sup>4</sup> it always has this
<div n="lb"/>sense, corresponding to the Graha-pātras of the later ritual,
<div n="lb"/>and that sometimes it is so used in the singular<sup>5</sup> or dual<sup>6</sup> also.
<div n="lb"/>In some cases,<sup>7</sup> however, he recognizes its use as denoting the
<div n="lb"/>mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here,
<div n="lb"/>as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a derivative sense Camū appears in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>9</sup> to denote a trough, either of solid stone or consisting of
[Page1-256+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>bricks, used by the Eastern people to protect the body of the
<div n="lb"/>dead from contact with the earth, like modern stone-lined
<div n="lb"/>graves or vaults.
