{@Madhyama-śī@}¦ is found in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>Roth<sup>2</sup> assigns to the word the meaning of {%intercessor,%} which
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>3</sup> accepts, in the sense of ‘mediator’ or ‘arbiter,’ as a
<div n="lb"/>legal term, but which Roth may, as Lanman<sup>4</sup> suggests, have
<div n="lb"/>intended to express ‘adversary’ or ‘preventer’ of the disease
<div n="lb"/>referred to in the hymn. Whitney<sup>5</sup> thinks that it means ‘mid-

<div n="lb"/>most man’ or ‘chief’ as the one round whom his followers
<div n="lb"/>encamp.<sup>6</sup> Geldner,<sup>7</sup> however, thinks that a third king, who is
<div n="lb"/>‘neutral’ between two enemies, is intended.
