{@Hari-yūpīyā@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the
<div n="lb"/>scene of the defeat of the {@Vṛcīvants@} by {@Abhyāvartin Cāya-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@mana.@} It may denote either a place or a river, since many
<div n="lb"/>battles seem to have been fought on the banks of rivers.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>2</sup> took it as the name of a town on the river {@Yavyāvatī,@}
<div n="lb"/>which is identified with it in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the
<div n="lb"/>passage. Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> thinks that it is the river Iryāb (Haliāb),
<div n="lb"/>a tributary of the Kurum ({@Krumu@}), but this is not at all
<div n="lb"/>probable.
