{@Krivi@}¦ is asserted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> to have been
<div n="lb"/>the older name of the {@Pañcālas.@} This statement is supported
<div n="lb"/>by the name of the king there mentioned, {@Kraivya Pāñcāla,@}
<div n="lb"/>The Krivis appear in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> as settled on the {@Sindhu@}
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Asiknī.@} It is a plausible conjecture of Zimmer's<sup>3</sup> that
<div n="lb"/>with the {@Kurus@} they made up the {@Vaikarṇa@} people.<sup>4</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>importance of the Pañcālas, and the insignificance of the
<div n="lb"/>Krivis, may be explained in part by the fact that the later
<div n="lb"/>Kuru-Pañcāla alliance included the {@Bharatas.@} It is also
<div n="lb"/>probable, as Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> suggests, from the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>6</sup> that the {@Turvaśas@} were included in the Pañcālas, and
<div n="lb"/>as the latter name indicates, probably other tribes also. Or, if
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins' view<sup>7</sup> is accepted that Turvaśa was king of the
<div n="lb"/>Yadus, the latter may in part have been allied with the Krivis
<div n="lb"/>to form the Pañcālas.

<F>2) viii. 20, 24; 22, 12. Elsewhere-
<div n="lb"/>Krivi is doubtful in sense. In several
<div n="lb"/>passages (i. 30, 1; viii. 87, 1; ix. 9, 6,
<div n="lb"/>and perhaps i. 166, 6, where {%krivir-datī%}
<div n="lb"/>is an epithet of lightning) Oldenberg,
<div n="lb"/>{%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} i. 166, 341, understands
<div n="lb"/>the word to mean ‘horse.’ Elsewhere
<div n="lb"/>(ii. 17, 6; 22, 2; viii. 51, 8) he takes it
<div n="lb"/>to be a proper name, while in v. 44, 4,
<div n="lb"/>he is doubtful. In the passages last
<div n="lb"/>cited this view may very well be
<div n="lb"/>correct.</F>

<div n="lb"/>{%Society,%} 15, 258 {%et seq.%} This view is
<div n="lb"/>hardly convincing, while the disappear-
<div n="lb"/>ance of the Turvaśas is easily to be
<div n="lb"/>accounted for by their being merged,
<div n="lb"/>along with the Krivis, in the Pañcālas.
<div n="lb"/>The name of Krivi is lost in the Epic
<div n="lb"/>as completely as that of Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>(Pargiter, {%Journal of the Royal Asiatic%}
