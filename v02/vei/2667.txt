{@Rājanya@}¦ is the regular term in Vedic literature<sup>1</sup> for a man of
<div n="lb"/>the royal family, probably including also those who were not
<div n="lb"/>actually members of that family, but were nobles, though it
<div n="lb"/>may have been originally restricted to members of the royal
<div n="lb"/>family. This, however, does not appear clearly from any
<div n="lb"/>passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles
<div n="lb"/>irrespective of kingly power. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the Rājanya is different from the Rājaputra, who is literally a
<div n="lb"/>son of the king. The functions and place of the Rājanya are
<div n="lb"/>described under {@Kṣatriya,@} which expression later normally
<div n="lb"/>takes the place of Rājanya as a designation for the ruling class.
<div n="lb"/>His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> he is ranked with the learned Brahmin and the
[Page2-217+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>{@Grāmaṇī@} (who was a {@Vaiśya@}) as having reached the height of
<div n="lb"/>prosperity ({%gata-śrī%}).
<F>1) Only once in the Rv. in the late
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣa-sūkta, x. 90, 12; but often in
<div n="lb"/>the Av.: v. 17, 9; 18, 2; vi. 38, 4;
<div n="lb"/>x. 10, 18; xii. 4, 32 {%et seq.;%} xv. 8, 1;
<div n="lb"/>xix. 32, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4,
<div n="lb"/>13, 1; 5, 4, 4; 10, 1; v. 1, 10, 3, etc.
<div n="lb"/>Even in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>where, on the whole, the later use of
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya prevails, the Rājanya is often
<div n="lb"/>mentioned. See Eggeling's index, {%Sacred%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Books of the East,%} 44, 561.</F>

<div n="lb"/>191. It is quite likely that the noble
<div n="lb"/>families not related to the royal family
<div n="lb"/>were families of minor princes whose
<div n="lb"/>rule was merged in that of the king
<div n="lb"/>on the formation of a powerful tribe,
<div n="lb"/>as was the case in Germany.</F>
