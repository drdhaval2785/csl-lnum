{@Yajñopavīta@}¦ denotes the ‘wearing of the Brahminical thread
<div n="lb"/>over the left shoulder at the sacrifice,’ and is mentioned as early
<div n="lb"/>as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> Tilak,<sup>2</sup> however, urges that it
<div n="lb"/>was not originally a thread that was worn, but a garment of
<div n="lb"/>cloth ({@Vāsas@}) or of deerskin ({@Ajina@}). This seems quite probable.
