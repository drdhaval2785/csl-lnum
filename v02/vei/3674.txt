{@Camū@}¦ denotes the vessel used for the offering to the god,<sup>32</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{@Kalaśa@} and {@Camasa@} those used for the priests to drink from.
<div n="lb"/>Sometimes<sup>33</sup> the Camū denotes the mortar and pestle. Perhaps
<div n="lb"/>the vessel was so called because of its mortar-like shape.
<div n="P"/>The skin on which the shoots were placed was called
<div n="lb"/>{@Tvac,@}<sup>34</sup> or twice {%go%} (‘cow-hide’).<sup>35</sup> {@Kośa,@}<sup>36</sup> Sadhastha,<sup>37</sup> {@Dru,@}<sup>38</sup>
[Page2-477+ 76]
<div n="lb"/>{@Vana,@}<sup>39</sup> {@Droṇa,@}<sup>40</sup> are all terms used for Soma vessels, while
<div n="lb"/>{@Sruva@}<sup>41</sup> denotes the ‘ladle.’
<div n="P"/>Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to
<div n="lb"/>increase its yield of juice.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process
<div n="lb"/>of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was
<div n="lb"/>certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve<sup>43</sup> ({@Pavitra@}).
<div n="lb"/>The Soma was then used unmixed ({%śukra,%}<sup>44</sup> {%śuci%})<sup>45</sup> for Indra and
<div n="lb"/>{@Vāyu,@} but the {@Kaṇvas@} seem to have dropped this usage.<sup>46</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>juice is described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>47</sup> tawny ({%hari%}),<sup>48</sup> or ruddy
<div n="lb"/>({%aruṇa%}),<sup>49</sup> and as having a fragrant smell,<sup>50</sup> at least as a
<div n="lb"/>rule.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>Soma was mixed with milk ({@Gavāśir@}),<sup>52</sup> curd or sour milk
<div n="lb"/>({@Dadhyāśir@}),<sup>53</sup> or grain ({@Yavāśir@}).<sup>54</sup> The admixtures are
[Page2-478+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>alluded to with various figurative expressions, as {@Atka,@}
<div n="lb"/>‘armour’;<sup>55</sup> {@Vastra@}<sup>56</sup> or {@Vāsas,@}<sup>57</sup> ‘garment’; {@Abhiśrī,@}<sup>58</sup> ‘admix-
<div n="lb"/>ture’; {%rūpa,%}<sup>59</sup> ‘beauty’; {%śrī,%}<sup>60</sup> ‘splendour’; {%rasa,%}<sup>61</sup> ‘flavour’;
<div n="lb"/>{%prayas,%}<sup>62</sup> ‘dainty’; and perhaps {%nabhas,%}<sup>63</sup> ‘fragrance.’ The
<div n="lb"/>adjective {%tīvra%}<sup>64</sup> denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when
<div n="lb"/>so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed
<div n="lb"/>out, are denoted by {%ṛjīṣa,%} ‘residue.’<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with
<div n="lb"/>Soma: perhaps the {%kośa madhu-ścut,%} ‘the pail distilling sweet-
<div n="lb"/>ness,’ was used for the mixing.<sup>66</sup> It seems doubtful if Surā was
<div n="lb"/>ever so mixed.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>two of the Avesta.<sup>68</sup> The evening pressing was specially
<div n="lb"/>connected with the Ṛbhus, the midday with Indra, the
<div n="lb"/>morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods
<div n="lb"/>also had their share.<sup>69</sup> The drinker of Soma and the non-
<div n="lb"/>drinker are sharply discriminated in the texts.<sup>70</sup> Localities
<div n="lb"/>where Soma was consumed were {@Ārjīka, Pastyāvant, Śarya-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ṇāvant, Suṣomā,@} the territory of the {@Pañcajanāḥ@} or ‘five
[Page2-479+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>peoples,’ and so on.<sup>71</sup> The effects of Soma in exhilarating and
<div n="lb"/>exciting the drinkers are often alluded to.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed
<div n="lb"/>to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is
<div n="lb"/>very slight,<sup>73</sup> and not decisive.

<F>72) See Rv. viii. 48. It was equally
<div n="lb"/>prized in Avestic times. It is, however,
<div n="lb"/>seldom spoken of as giving the priests
<div n="lb"/>pleasure: Rv. i. 91, 13; viii. 2, 12;
<div n="lb"/>x. 167, 3. There are many references
<div n="lb"/>to sickness caused by it (Maitrāyaṇī
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 13 etc.). The Sautrā-
<div n="lb"/>maṇī was a rite designed to expiate the ill
<div n="lb"/>caused by vomiting Soma as Indra had
<div n="lb"/>done: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 2, 5, 6;
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9; xii. 7,
<div n="lb"/>1, 11. The name of the rite is already
<div n="lb"/>found in Av. vii. 3, 2, and the rite
<div n="lb"/>itself is no doubt older (see also {@Viṣū-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@cikā@}). This fact tells in favour of the
<div n="lb"/>traditional identification of the plant,
<div n="lb"/>for the medical passage quoted by
<div n="lb"/>Max Müller refers to its producing
