GHAṬAKARPARA¦. One of the nine great poets in
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit reputed as the nine gems in Vikramāditya's
<div n="lb"/>court.
<div n="NI"/>“Dhanvantari—Kṣapaṇak Āmarasiṃha—Śaṅku—Vetāla-
<div n="lb"/>bhaṭṭa—Ghaṭakarpara—Kālidāsāḥ”. A poem of twen-
<div n="lb"/>ty-two verses in Sanskrit called Ghaṭakarpara kāvya is
<div n="lb"/>attributed to him. The theme of the poem is a message
<div n="lb"/>despatched by the hero to his wife who has only recently
<div n="lb"/>been married. All the stanzas are in yamaka (repeating
<div n="lb"/>a word or set of words to convey different meanings at
<div n="lb"/>the end of each line). By composing a poem called
<div n="lb"/>‘Nalodaya’, Kālidāsa answered the challenge posed by
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭakarpara in the use of Yamaka. Ghaṭakarpara
<div n="lb"/>answered Kālidāsa in the following stanza.
<Poem>Eko hi doṣo guṇasannipāte
<div n="lb"/>nimajjatīndoriti yo babhāṣe /
<div n="lb"/>nūnam na dṛṣṭaṃ kavināpi tena
<div n="lb"/>dāridryadoṣo guṇarāśināśī.</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Kālidāsa, in verse 3, Canto 1 of Kumārasaṃbhava
<div n="lb"/>had written ‘Eko hi doṣo guṇasannipāte nimajjatīndoḥ
<div n="lb"/>kiraṇeṣvivāṅkaḥ”. In the above verse by Ghaṭakarpara
<div n="lb"/>the usage ‘Kavināpi tena’ may be interpreted in two
<div n="lb"/>ways, viz. Kavinā+api+tena and Kavi+nāpitena. By
<div n="lb"/>the second combination Ghaṭakarpara converted Kāli-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa into a barber (nāpita).
