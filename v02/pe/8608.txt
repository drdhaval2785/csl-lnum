VṚKA III¦. An asura. This asura wanted to bring the
<div n="lb"/>Devas under his control. “How to achieve it? The only
<div n="lb"/>way is to please one of the three god-heads.” The
<div n="lb"/>asura saw Nārada and asked him which of the three
<div n="lb"/>god-heads could easily be pleased. Nārada replied
<div n="lb"/>that it was Śiva. Vṛka resolved to please Śiva and be-
<div n="lb"/>gan to do penance. He cut each of his organs and offer-
<div n="lb"/>ed it in the fire as oblation. At last when Vṛkāsura
<div n="lb"/>was beginning to cut his head to offer it in fire, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>made his appearance, and asked him what his wish
<div n="lb"/>was. The boon he requested for, was that any one whose
<div n="lb"/>head he touched with his finger should die instantly.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva granted that boon.
<div n="NI"/>The asura decided to try the boon, on the giver himself
<div n="lb"/>first. Terrified at this, Śiva began to run. The asura
<div n="lb"/>chased him. At last Śiva sought protection from Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Assuming the form of a boy, Mahāviṣṇu stood on the
<div n="lb"/>way and stopped Vṛkāsura, who was running after Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>The boy asked him why he was running. The asura
<div n="lb"/>told the boy everything. Then the boy laughed and
<div n="lb"/>said “Oh! Asura! What Śiva said was a lie. He has no
<div n="lb"/>divine power now. He was making fun of you. Not an
<div n="lb"/>ant would die by the touch of your fingers. You just try
<div n="lb"/>on your head and see for yourself.” Hearing this the
<div n="lb"/>asura became dejected. He thought what the boy said
<div n="lb"/>was true. The poor creature touched his own head with
<div n="lb"/>his finger. The moment he touched his head, he fell
<div n="lb"/>down dead. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10). This story has
<div n="lb"/>similarity with that of Bhasmāsura. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Bhasmāsura).
