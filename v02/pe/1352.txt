BṚHATTA¦(M). A song of Sāma (conciliation—one of
<div n="lb"/>the four expedients) originated from the head of her-
<div n="lb"/>mit Pāñcajanya. From the face of his hermit another
<div n="lb"/>song of Sāma called Rathantara also originated. These
<div n="lb"/>two songs of Sāma are very effective expedients. So
<div n="lb"/>they are called Tarasāharas (quickly effective). (M.B.
