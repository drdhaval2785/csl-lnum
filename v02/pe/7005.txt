ŚUKA II¦. A messenger of Rāvaṇa. This Śuka had a
<div n="lb"/>friend named Sāraṇa. These two persons were expert
<div n="lb"/>spies who used to gather secret and important pieces of
<div n="lb"/>information from the strongholds of Rāvaṇa's friends
<div n="lb"/>and enemies and passed them on to Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Soon after Śrī Rāma entered Laṅkā, Rāvaṇa sent Śuka
<div n="lb"/>and Sāraṇa to Śrī Rāma's camp. After taking a distant
<div n="lb"/>view of the surroundings, they entered the camp of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma in the form of monkeys. Taking care not to
<div n="lb"/>come within the observation of Vibhīṣaṇa, they went
<div n="lb"/>about the military camps, gathering secret information.
<div n="lb"/>Just then they were met by Jāmbavān and Hanūmān.
<div n="lb"/>After closely observing them for a considerable time,
<div n="lb"/>they understood that they were enemy spies. The
<div n="lb"/>monkey-heroes promptly seized them and produced
<div n="lb"/>them before Sugrīva. Confused and frightened under a
<div n="lb"/>shower of questions they sought the protection of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. While Śrī Rāma was interrogating them,
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa happened to come there. At his sight, Śuka
<div n="lb"/>and Sāraṇa were alarmed. Grasping the whole situation
<div n="lb"/>in an instant, Vibhīṣaṇa kicked both of them when
<div n="lb"/>they assumed their former shapes as Rākṣasas. The
<div n="lb"/>monkey-leaders sprang at them. The Rākṣasas begged
<div n="lb"/>for pardon and prayed for Śrī Rāma's protection. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma forgave them and set them free. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa; Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
