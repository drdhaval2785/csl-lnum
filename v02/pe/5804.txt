<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other Details.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%i) Nala's incognito life.%} While Nala was wandering in
<div n="lb"/>the dense forest after leaving Damayantī, he was bitten
<div n="lb"/>by the serpent, Karkoṭaka. His complexion turned blue
<div n="lb"/>owing to the effect of the poison. Karkoṭaka gave him
<div n="lb"/>a garment by wearing which Nala could regain his form.
<div n="lb"/>As advised by Karkoṭaka, Nala went to the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtuparṇa, king of Ayodhyā, assuming the name
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuka. He lived there as the chief charioteer of the
<div n="lb"/>king. He had mastered the art “Aśvahṛdaya” by which
<div n="lb"/>he could drive the chariot-horses with astonishing speed.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtuparṇa appointed him as his chief charioteer and gave
<div n="lb"/>him two assistants, Vārṣṇeya and Jīvala. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Parva, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>{%(ii) Ṛtuparṇa and the second marriage of Damayanti.%}
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī came to know that Nala was living in Ṛtu-
<div n="lb"/>parṇa's palace, through the messenger Parṇāda. She
[Page654-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sent a secret message to Ayodhyā through a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>named Sudeva that her second marriage was fixed for
<div n="lb"/>the next day and that Ṛtuparṇa should attend the
<div n="lb"/>ceremony. Ṛtuparṇa started at once with Bāhuka as his
<div n="lb"/>charioteer. On the way, Ṛtuparṇa's cloak happened to
<div n="lb"/>fall down from the chariot. At once he asked Nala to
<div n="lb"/>stop the chariot. But he told him that within a moment,
<div n="lb"/>the chariot had covered a distance of one yojana from
<div n="lb"/>the place where the cloak fell.
<div n="NI"/>They saw a tree in the forest which was heavily laden
<div n="lb"/>with fruit. Ṛtuparṇa was able to tell at a glance, the
<div n="lb"/>exact number of leaves and fruits on that tree. He told
<div n="lb"/>Nala that he was able to do so with the help of the art
<div n="lb"/>“Akṣahṛdaya” and he taught it to Nala. In return for
<div n="lb"/>it, Nala taught the king the art of Aśvahṛdaya. At last
<div n="lb"/>they reached the city of Vidarbha. Damayantī managed
<div n="lb"/>to recognize Nala even in his disguise. Ṛtuparṇa who
<div n="lb"/>was happy over the reunion of Nala and Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ayodhyā on the next day. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 77).
