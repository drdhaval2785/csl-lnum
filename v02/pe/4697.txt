NALASETU¦. The rock bridge built by the monkey
<div n="lb"/>named Nala. The bridge over which Śrī Rāma and the
<div n="lb"/>monkey-army crossed the sea to Laṅkā was built under
<div n="lb"/>the supervision of Nala and so the bridge came to be
<div n="lb"/>called Nalasetu. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 283,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 45).
