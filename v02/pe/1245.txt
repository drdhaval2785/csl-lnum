BODHISATTVA¦. A good-natured husband generally
<div n="lb"/>quoted in Sanskrit works. The following is the story
<div n="lb"/>given about him in Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 9.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived a wealthy Vaiśya, who had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Bodhisattva. When the childhood of the boy was at an
<div n="lb"/>end his mother died. The Vaiśya married again and got
<div n="lb"/>his son also married. Because of the ear-buzzing of his
<div n="lb"/>wife, the Vaiśya drove his son out of the house. Bodhi-
<div n="lb"/>sattva left the house of his father, with his wife. By
<div n="lb"/>and by they reached a desert. Not a drop of water was to
<div n="lb"/>be had. There was not even the shoot of a grass. It was a
<div n="lb"/>sandy place with nothing else in sight. He walked for
<div n="lb"/>seven days carrying his wife on his shoulders. His wife
<div n="lb"/>grew weary and worn with hunger and thirst. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>that she was about to die he gave her his flesh and blood.
<div n="lb"/>The wicked woman took them and saved herself from
<div n="lb"/>death. On the eighth day they reached the jungles of a
<div n="lb"/>hilly place full of fruit-trees and with a river with grassy
<div n="lb"/>banks, flowing down to the valley. With fruits and cool
<div n="lb"/>water he appeased the hunger and thirst of his wife.
<div n="lb"/>Then he got down to the river to take a bath. He saw
<div n="lb"/>a man with his limbs cut off, coming afloat. Now and
<div n="lb"/>then he was producing pitiable sounds. The kind son of
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśya, without minding his weakness due to fast for
<div n="lb"/>the last seven days, swam to the man and brought him to
<div n="lb"/>the bank of the river. He did all services possible for him.
<div n="lb"/>Then he asked him who had cut off his limbs. He rep-
<div n="lb"/>lied that his enemies had done so, with the intention that
<div n="lb"/>he might die suffering severe pain for a long time. The
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya's son stood still for a little while. Then he took
<div n="lb"/>his bath. With his wife he lived in the forest doing
<div n="lb"/>penance. The wounds of the man he saved had been
<div n="lb"/>healed. The Vaiśya's son, one day, went out to the
<div n="lb"/>forest to gather fruits and roots for their food. At that
<div n="lb"/>time his wife grew lustful and had coition with the man
<div n="lb"/>without limbs. Gradually she began to dote on him. She
<div n="lb"/>decided to kill her husband who was an impediment on
<div n="lb"/>her way. She pretended to be ill. The Vaiśya's son began
<div n="lb"/>to treat her. One day she took her husband to the edge of
<div n="lb"/>a very deep well and said: “See, there is a divine herb at
<div n="lb"/>the bottom of this well. I will be cured if I could eat it.
<div n="lb"/>This is what a goddess told me in a dream yesternight”.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this her husband made a rope, and tied it to a
<div n="lb"/>tree. Then he began to go down the well by the rope.
<div n="lb"/>She cut the rope and the man fell into the well. There
<div n="lb"/>was a passage from the well to the river. The current
<div n="lb"/>took him through that passage to the river. He got out of
<div n="lb"/>the river, and sat under a tree thinking of the wickedness
<div n="lb"/>of women. There was a city close by. At that time the
<div n="lb"/>King of the city was dead and there was no heir left. The
<div n="lb"/>subjects of the city brought an elephant and said, “whom
<div n="lb"/>ever this elephant takes and places on his back shall be
<div n="lb"/>our king”. They sent the elephant out. The elephant
[Page147-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>was pleased at the virtuous character of the son of the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya. So taking him, as if he was God, placed him on
<div n="lb"/>its back and walked to the city. The people gathered
<div n="lb"/>round him and anointed him as their King. The son of
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśya became King. He never even thought of
<div n="lb"/>women who are generally fickle and wicked.
<div n="NI"/>The wicked wife of the Vaiśya's son took the limbless
<div n="lb"/>man on her shoulder and wandered about saying, “The
<div n="lb"/>enemies of my husband have put him in this plight.
<div n="lb"/>Because of my conjugal fidelity I carry him thus and
<div n="lb"/>earn our daily bread. Please give us alms”. In this
<div n="lb"/>manner she spent her days in begging. Thus wandering
<div n="lb"/>from place to place she reached the city where the
<div n="lb"/>Vaisya's son was the King. The people, seeing her
<div n="lb"/>loyalty to her husband, honoured her and spoke highly
<div n="lb"/>of her. Hearing that a very loyal wife had reached his
<div n="lb"/>city the King sent for her. The King recognized her
<div n="lb"/>instantly. But she did not know him. The King reminded
<div n="lb"/>her of her deeds of the past one by one and began to
<div n="lb"/>tease and scold her. Finally when she understood that
<div n="lb"/>the King was her husband she was dumb-founded. The
<div n="lb"/>amazed ministers looked at each other. The King reveal-
<div n="lb"/>ed everything to them. The ministers disfigured her and
<div n="lb"/>drove her away.
