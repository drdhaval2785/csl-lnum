KIṢKINDHĀ¦. An ancient kingdom of the monkeys in
<div n="lb"/>South India. This kingdom is mentioned both in the
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>During the Rāmāyaṇa period a monkey King called
<div n="lb"/>Ṛkṣarāja was the ruler of Kiṣkindhā. He was childless.
[Page413-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time a son called Bāli was born to Aruṇī-
<div n="lb"/>devī by Indra, and another son called Sugrīva was born
<div n="lb"/>to her by Sūrya. (See under Aruṇa). Both the boys
<div n="lb"/>were brought up in the Āśrama of sage Gautama.
<div n="lb"/>When they grew up, Indra handed them over to Ṛkṣa-
<div n="lb"/>rāja, and thus Bāli and Sugrīva came to Kiskindhā.
<div n="lb"/>After the death of Ṛkṣarāja, Bāli became King of Kiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>kindhā and Sugrīva lived in the service of his brother.
<div n="lb"/>At that time there was a very mighty Asura called
<div n="lb"/>Dundubhi. Finding no one fit to fight with, he challeng-
<div n="lb"/>ed Varuṇa. Varuṇa directed him to Himavān, whose
<div n="lb"/>peaks he rent asunder, and played with. Then Himavān
<div n="lb"/>told Dundubhi that he was of a peaceful nature and
<div n="lb"/>that Bāli would be a match for him (Dundubhi).
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Dundubhi fought with Bāli and got killed.
<div n="lb"/>Bāli cast away the corpse of Dundubhi. The blood
<div n="lb"/>oozing out from the nose of Dundubhi fell on the
<div n="lb"/>body of sage Mataṅga who was engaged in penance on
<div n="lb"/>the peak Ṛṣyamūka. Bymeans of his divine powers, the
<div n="lb"/>sage found out the origin of the blood contaminating his
<div n="lb"/>body, and cursed that Bāli would die the moment he
<div n="lb"/>set foot on the mountain.
<div n="NI"/>Dundubhi's son Māyāvī was enraged at the death of
<div n="lb"/>his father. He went to Kiṣkindhā to take revenge on
<div n="lb"/>Bāli, but got defeated by the latter in fighting. Māyāvī
<div n="lb"/>took to his heels; Bāli followed him, and Sugrīva follow-
<div n="lb"/>ed his brother. Māyāvī took refuge in a cave followed
<div n="lb"/>by Bāli, and Sugrīva waited at the mouth of cave. Even
<div n="lb"/>after one year neither Bāli nor Māyāvī emerged out of
<div n="lb"/>the cave, but Sugrīva saw blood coming out of the
<div n="lb"/>cave and heard Māyāvī roaring. Taking it for granted
<div n="lb"/>that Bāli was killed, Sugrīva closed the mouth of the
<div n="lb"/>cave, returned to Kiṣkindhā, and at the instance of his
<div n="lb"/>subjects assumed kingship.
<div n="NI"/>But, Bāli forced open the cave, hurried back to his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom, and interpreting the action of Sugrīva as
<div n="lb"/>one purposely done to usurp the throne, drove
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva away and took for himself Sugrīva's wife. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Bāli became again King of Kiṣkindhā.
<div n="NI"/>There is a mountain called “Bāli-kerā-mala”—mountain
<div n="lb"/>prohibited to Bāli—in the eastern region of the former
<div n="lb"/>princely kingdom of Travancore. Is it in any way con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with Ṛṣyamūkācala?
<div n="NI"/>Sugrīva founded a new kingdom at Ṛṣyamūka moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain. Mainda, Dvivida, Hanūmān and Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>were the ministers of Sugrīva. It was while Sugrīva was
<div n="lb"/>thus living on Ṛṣyamūkācala that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>came that way in the course of their search for Sītā. In
<div n="lb"/>accordance with the agreement made between Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>and Rāma, the latter killed Bāli and crowned Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>as the King of Kiṣkindhā. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>kindhā Kāṇḍa, and Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 280).
<div n="NI"/>During the triumphal tour of Sahadeva in the South he
<div n="lb"/>fought against Kiṣkindhā, and after seven days' fighting
<div n="lb"/>the monkeys saw Sahadeva off with a present of costly
<div n="lb"/>gems.
<div n="NI"/>“Sahadeva fought against the monkey chiefs like
<div n="lb"/>Mainda, Dvivida etc. for seven days, but neither of
<div n="lb"/>them got exhausted, and the monkey chiefs, with
<div n="lb"/>affection and gratitude asked Sahadeva to depart with
<div n="lb"/>gems.” (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 31).
<div n="NI"/>During this period nothing was heard of Sugrīva,
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān and Jāmbavān in Kiṣkindhā. Might be
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva was no more. Hanūmān, after the death of Śrī
[Page414-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, lived in Gandhamādana in Kimpuruṣavarṣa.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhārata and Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha). From the
<div n="lb"/>story of Prasena it may be seen that Jāmbavan left
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā and lived in another cave with his sons
<div n="lb"/>and other relations. It was the other two ministers of
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva, Mainda and Dvivida, who were ruling Kiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>kindhā when Sahadeva went there. The power and
<div n="lb"/>prestige of Kiṣkindhā had begun to set by then, and in
<div n="lb"/>course of time Kiṣkindhā ceased to exist but in name.
