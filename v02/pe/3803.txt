KUMBHAKA II¦. (Nikumbhaka). A very reputed sage.
<div n="lb"/>If he visited any place at dusk he left it only after a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. He visited Kāśī once when King Divo-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa was ruling the state after having killed the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>called Kṣemaka, who had lived like a king there. Kum-
<div n="lb"/>bhaka lived in a forest in Kāśī with his disciples.
<div n="lb"/>Prosperity reigned supreme within a radius of three
<div n="lb"/>Yojanas from where the sage lived. Neither wild beasts
<div n="lb"/>nor famine infested the area.
<div n="NI"/>Once a fierce famine broke out in Kāśī, and the failure
<div n="lb"/>of rain caused great havoc. Finding it impossible to

<div n="lb"/>feed the cows their keepers went with their live-stock
<div n="lb"/>every morning to Kumbhaka's place where summer had
<div n="lb"/>not yet even peeped in, and after feeding their cows
<div n="lb"/>there, they returned home in the evening. But, one even-
<div n="lb"/>ing they led back with them the cows used by the sage for
<div n="lb"/>his Pūjās. When the sun set, as usual the sage sat before
<div n="lb"/>the sacred fire for Pūjā. But, the cow had not come.
<div n="lb"/>With his divine vision he found out the reason for the
<div n="lb"/>absence of the cow. He cursed that the region where
<div n="lb"/>the keepers of the cows lived be turned into a desert,
<div n="lb"/>and the kingdom of Kāśī became a desert place, where-
<div n="lb"/>upon king Divodāsa went to the banks of the Gomatī
<div n="lb"/>and founded a new kingdom there. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2).
