SATYABHĀMĀ¦. The wife of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Introduction.%} Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa himself said about the
<div n="lb"/>previous birth of Satyabhāmā. There was an occasion
<div n="lb"/>for saying that.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nārada came from the world of the gods to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā. He had brought with him some flowers of
<div n="lb"/>the Kalpaka tree. Nārada gave all those flowers to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa divided them among his wives,
<div n="lb"/>but he had forgotten Satyabhāmā. Being unable to
<div n="lb"/>subdue her sorrow and anger she got into her bedroom
<div n="lb"/>and wept and sighed and lay there. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to
<div n="lb"/>know of this. He took Satyabhāmā with him on the
<div n="lb"/>back of Garuḍa and went to the world of Gods. They
<div n="lb"/>reached there and asked Indra for some Kahlāra
<div n="lb"/>flowers. Indra refused to give. Garuḍa got ready to
[Page704-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>uproot the tree. Then Indra wielded his thunderbolt.
<div n="lb"/>To honour the weapon thunderbolt, Garuḍa left a
<div n="lb"/>feather of his there and returned to Dvārakā. Because
<div n="lb"/>of the hitting of the thunderbolt, the peacock, mon-
<div n="lb"/>goose and jungle crow were born from Garuḍa. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa who won the war, returned with Satyabhāmā
<div n="lb"/>mounted on Garuḍa, to Dvārakā. The Kalpaka tree
<div n="lb"/>brought from the world of gods, was planted in the
<div n="lb"/>garden in front of the palace of Satyabhāmā. When
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Kalpaka tree became her own,
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā became proud. At that time Nārada
<div n="lb"/>came there. She asked Nārada what she should do so
<div n="lb"/>as to have Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Kalpaka tree with her in
<div n="lb"/>all births. Nārada said that, for that, she had only to
<div n="lb"/>do Tulāpuruṣadāna. She instantly placed Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and the Kalpaka tree in the balance and all the things
<div n="lb"/>placed in equal weight were given to Nārada himself.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada received them and went to the world of Gods.
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā became overjoyed. She asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>what good deeds she had done to earn so much happi-
<div n="lb"/>ness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa described the previous birth of Satya-
<div n="lb"/>bhāmā. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 90).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous birth of Satyabhāmā.%} Towards the close of
<div n="lb"/>the Kṛtayuga, there was a Brahmin named Devaśarmā
<div n="lb"/>who was born of the clan of Agni in Māyāpurī. This
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin was well-versed in the Vedas and the
<div n="lb"/>Vedāṅgas. In the old age a daughter named Guṇavatī
<div n="lb"/>was born to him. He gave his daughter to his
<div n="lb"/>disciple Candraśarmā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Devaśarmā and Candraśarmā went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>to bring Darbha (poa) and Samit (butea). While they
<div n="lb"/>were walking here and there in the Mango grove in
<div n="lb"/>the Himālayas a giant closed with them. Because of
<div n="lb"/>terror their bodies were stiffened and so they could not
<div n="lb"/>run. The fierce giant killed both of them. The escorts
<div n="lb"/>sent by Viṣṇu came and took both of them to Vaikuṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭha. Guṇavatī cried aloud when she heard that her
<div n="lb"/>father and husband were killed by a giant. She
<div n="lb"/>lamented for a long while and then fainted and fell
<div n="lb"/>down. When she came to herself she began to cry
<div n="lb"/>again. At last she sold the furniture and conducted
<div n="lb"/>the funeral rites of her father and husband. After that
<div n="lb"/>she lived by manual labour. She observed fast and the
<div n="lb"/>vow of Kṛttikā and Ekādaśī.
<div n="NI"/>Guṇavatī, who was weak and lean because of old age
<div n="lb"/>and fever once walked slowly to the river Ganges to
<div n="lb"/>bathe. When she got into the river she shivered be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of cold. Then an aerial chariot came down
<div n="lb"/>from the sky. The messengers of Viṣṇu took her in
<div n="lb"/>the chariot, to Vaikuṇṭha. The celestial maids fanned
<div n="lb"/>her with the whisk of yak. After this Mahāviṣṇu in-
<div n="lb"/>carnated as Śrī Kṛṣṇa to destroy the wicked. Those
<div n="lb"/>who were the dependants of Viṣṇu in Vaikuṇṭha took
<div n="lb"/>birth in Dvārakā. Devaśarmā the father of Guṇavatī took
<div n="lb"/>birth as Satrājit. Candraśarmā became Akrūra. Guṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vatī became Satyabhāmā. Because of the goodness earned
<div n="lb"/>by the fast of Kṛttikā, she had become a beloved one of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Because she made a grove of holy basil (tulasī)
<div n="lb"/>at the gate of Viṣṇu in the previous birth the Kalpaka
<div n="lb"/>tree came to her garden in this birth. Because she
<div n="lb"/>lighted lamps in Kārttika month Mahālakṣmī lives
<div n="lb"/>permanently in her house. Because she did fast and
<div n="lb"/>vow in Kārttika imagining Viṣṇu as her husband, she
<div n="lb"/>became the wife of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in this birth. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 91).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Family life.%} See under Kṛṣṇa, Para 16 and Naraka
<div n="lb"/>Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) The sons Bhīma and others were born to Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa by Satyabhāmā. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 276).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Narakāsura stole the ear-rings of Aditi, the mother
<div n="lb"/>of the devas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā went to
<div n="lb"/>fight with Narakāsura. They killed him and recovered
<div n="lb"/>the ear-rings and gave them back to Aditi. At that
<div n="lb"/>time Aditi blessed Satyabhāmā thus: “Till Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>forsakes his body you will not be affected by old age.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover you will always have a divine fragrance and
<div n="lb"/>good qualities.” (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Satyabhāmā had a beautiful white palace in
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā. The steps of the palace were paved with
<div n="lb"/>jewels. To those who pass over its steps, hot season will
<div n="lb"/>appear to be cold. (M.B. Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 38),
<div n="NI"/>(iv) When the Pāṇḍavas were living in the Kāmyaka
<div n="lb"/>forest at the time of their forest life, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā paid them a visit. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 183, Verse 11).
<div n="NI"/>(v) At this time Satyabhāmā asked Pāñcālī about the
<div n="lb"/>means and ways to bring the husband over to her side.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 238, Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) When Arjuna came to Dvārakā, after Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>had forsaken his body, Satyabhāmā lamented with the
<div n="lb"/>other queens for a long time. (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) After this Satyabhāmā went to the forest for
<div n="lb"/>penance. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 74).
