YADU I¦. The founder of Yādava Vaṃśa or Yadu
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the
<div n="lb"/>following order:—Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—
<div n="lb"/>Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti—Yadu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Yadu Vaṃśa (Yādava Vaṃśa).%} The origin of Yadu
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśa is from Atri. Candra, Durvāsas and Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>Muni were the sons of Atri by Anasūyā. Budha was
<div n="lb"/>born to Candra, Purūravas was born to Budha, Āyus
<div n="lb"/>was born to Purūravas, and Nahuṣa was born to Āyus.
<div n="lb"/>Two children, Āyati and Yayāti were born to Nahuṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti had two wives, Śarmiṣṭhā and Devayānī. Three
[Page889-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sons, Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru were born to
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā. The Pūru vaṃśa takes its origin from Pūru.
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti had two sons by Devayānī. They were Yadu
<div n="lb"/>and Turvasu. The descendants of Yadu are the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas.
<div n="NI"/>Four sons, Sahasrajit, Kroṣṭā, Nala and Ripu were
<div n="lb"/>born to Yadu. Sahasrajit had a son, Śatajit. Three sons
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhaya, Veṇuhaya and Hehaya were born to
<div n="lb"/>Śatajit. Of them Hehaya became famous under the
<div n="lb"/>name of Ekavīra and founded the Hehaya vaṃśa. The
<div n="lb"/>Hehayas and Bhārgavas were on terms of enmity.
<div n="lb"/>Dharma was born to Hehaya, and Kunti or Kuṇi was
<div n="lb"/>born to Dharma. Kuṇi had four sons—Sadājit, Māhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>mān, Bhadrasena and Durdama. Dhanaka was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Bhadrasena and Dhanaka had four sons—Kṛtavīrya,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtāgni, Kṛtavarmā and Kṛtaujas. Of them, Kṛtavīrya
<div n="lb"/>who was the eldest, was the father of Kārtavīryārjuna.
<div n="lb"/>From here, Yadu vaṃśa continues from Kārtavīryārjuna.
<div n="lb"/>He had five sons, Jayadhvaja, Śūrasena, Vṛṣabha,
<div n="lb"/>Madhu and Ūrjjita. Vṛṣṇi was the son of Madhu, the
<div n="lb"/>fourth of them. From this point, Yadu vaṃśa continues
<div n="lb"/>from Vṛṣṇi. Yādava vaṃśa from this stage is also known
<div n="lb"/>as Vṛṣṇi vaṃśa. Vṛṣṇi had four sons—Sumitra, Yudhājit,
<div n="lb"/>Vasu and Sārvabhauma. Yadu vaṃśa continues from
<div n="lb"/>Yudhājit. He had two sons, Śini and Nimna. Śini's son
<div n="lb"/>was Satyaka and Satyaka's son was Sātyaki. Sātyaki
<div n="lb"/>had another name, Yuyudhāna. Jaya was Sātyaki's son.
<div n="lb"/>Kuṇi was the son of Jaya, Anamitra was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Kuṇi and Pṛśni was the son of Anamitra. Pṛśni's sons
<div n="lb"/>were Citraratha and Śvaphalka. Viḍūratha and Kukūra
<div n="lb"/>were born to Citraratha. Śūra was the son of Viḍūratha.
<div n="lb"/>Śini was the son of Śūra, Bhoja was the son of Śini,
<div n="lb"/>Hṛdīka was the son of Bhoja. Four sons, Devavāha,
<div n="lb"/>Gadādhanvā, Kṛtaparvā and Śūra, were born to Hṛdīka.
<div n="lb"/>Śūra married Māriṣā and their children were Vasu,
<div n="lb"/>Devabhāga, Devaśravas, Ānaka. Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka,
<div n="lb"/>Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kavūka and Vasudeva. Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>married Devakī, the sister of Kaṃsa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was
<div n="lb"/>their son. Pradyumna was the son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Anirud-
<div n="lb"/>dha was the son of Pradyumna and Vajra was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Aniruddha. The last known link of that branch of
<div n="lb"/>Yadu vaṃśa was Vajra.
<div n="NI"/>Kaṃsa also belonged to Yadu vaṃśa. Kukūra who was
<div n="lb"/>the brother of Viḍūratha was the ancestor of Kaṃsa.
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena who was a lineal descendant of Kukūra, was
<div n="lb"/>the father of Kaṃsa. The Purāṇas mention Devakī, the
<div n="lb"/>mother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa as Kaṃsa's sister. But in fact she
<div n="lb"/>was not his direct sister. Ugrasena, Kaṃsa's father, had
<div n="lb"/>a brother named Devaka. This Devaka had three sons,
<div n="lb"/>Devāpa, Upadeva and Sudeva. Devakī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>mother was the daughter of Devāpa. Devakī had six
<div n="lb"/>sisters who were—Śrutadevā, Śāntidevā, Upadevā,
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdevā, Devarakṣitā and Sahadevā.
<div n="NI"/>Akrūra who went to Ambāḍi also belonged to another
<div n="lb"/>branch of Yadu vaṃśa. Pṛśni who was of the ninth
<div n="lb"/>generation from Vṛṣṇi, had two sons—Citraratha and
<div n="lb"/>Śvaphalka. Akrūra was the son of Śvaphalka.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details about Yadu Vaṃśa%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Yayāti wanted his son Yadu to transfer the latter's
<div n="lb"/>youthfulness to Yayāti. The son refused to oblige the
<div n="lb"/>father who therefore pronounced a curse that Yadu's
<div n="lb"/>descendants would not enjoy kingship. (For detailed
<div n="lb"/>story, see under Yayāti).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Yadu's descendants are called Yādavas. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 10).
[Page890-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Yadu was the son of Devayānī and the grandson
<div n="lb"/>of Śukrācārya. Although Yadu was a hero, he was dull-
<div n="lb"/>witted. He did not obey his father. He used to despise
<div n="lb"/>his father and brothers. His capital city was Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura. He became dull-witted after the loss of his king-
<div n="lb"/>dom by the curse of his father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 149).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The end of Yadu Vaṃśa.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa was one of the most
<div n="lb"/>important members of the Yadu Vaṃśa. That family
<div n="lb"/>continued only for 36 years more after the end of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata Yuddha. At the end of the thirtysix years, evil
<div n="lb"/>omens began to appear in Dvārakā. Whirlwinds began
<div n="lb"/>to blow furiously. Frightened birds began to fly helter-
<div n="lb"/>skelter. Rivers began to flow upwards. The whole land
<div n="lb"/>was enveloped in mist. Comets continued to drop
<div n="lb"/>from heaven, scattering sparks of fire. The sun's disc was
<div n="lb"/>eclipsed with clouds of dust.
<div n="NI"/>At that time, one day, the sages Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and
<div n="lb"/>Nārada happened to come to Dvārakā. A band of
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas, under the leadership of Sāmba, gathered round
<div n="lb"/>the sages to make fun of them. They dressed Sāmba like
<div n="lb"/>a pregnant woman and asked the sages what child “she”
<div n="lb"/>would bear. The enraged sages replied that the “Child”
<div n="lb"/>would be an iron pestle which would be the cause of
<div n="lb"/>the death of all the Yādavas. Besides, they added that,
<div n="lb"/>with the exception of Rāma, (Balabhadra Rāma)
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa, the whole of Yādava Vaṃśa would come
<div n="lb"/>to ruin.
<div n="NI"/>Next day Sāmba did give birth to an iron pestle. The
<div n="lb"/>frightened Yādavas recalled the curse of the sages. They
<div n="lb"/>reported the matter to their king. The king, in deep
<div n="lb"/>gloom, had the pestle filed into dust and ordered his
<div n="lb"/>men to throw the dust into the sea.
<div n="NI"/>People recalled Gāndhārī's curse on Śrī Kṛṣṇa after the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata Yuddha. The curse was that the family of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa who was the cause of all mischief, would be wiped
<div n="lb"/>out within a period of 36 years.
<div n="NI"/>At that time, women began to be stolen from Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>every night by a dark woman monster. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>weapon, Cakra slipped out of Kṛṣṇa's grip and rose up
<div n="lb"/>to heaven, in the very presence of the Vṛṣṇis. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>these evil omens, the alarmed Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
<div n="lb"/>began to leave the place on a pilgrimage. They reached
<div n="lb"/>the shore of Prabhāsa tīrtha. The Uddhavas parted
<div n="lb"/>company with the Yādavas there. Nobody prevented
<div n="lb"/>the Uddhavas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa who saw that the end of the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas was approaching, also kept silent. The Yādava
<div n="lb"/>leaders in despair, took to drinking. Intoxicated by
<div n="lb"/>drinking they began to quarrel. The particles of the
<div n="lb"/>iron pestle thrown into the sea, were carried and deposit-
<div n="lb"/>ed on the shore by the waves. They began to sprout in-
<div n="lb"/>to a kind of grass. The blades of this grass soon trans-
<div n="lb"/>formed themselves into iron pestles. The Yādavas pulled
<div n="lb"/>them out and began attacking each other with them.
<div n="lb"/>Most of them were beaten to death by their own kins-
<div n="lb"/>folk. Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was in a state of trance in
<div n="lb"/>“Yogāsana”, was hit on his toe by an arrow shot by a
<div n="lb"/>hunter and he fell into Samādhi. Balabhadra Rāma
<div n="lb"/>renounced his body and went to Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>After that the sea advanced and submerged the whole
<div n="lb"/>of Dvārakā. (M.B. Mausala Parva).
