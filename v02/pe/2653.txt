HAYAGRĪVA V¦. An incarnation of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%In Vedic literature:%}—In Vedic literature incarnation
<div n="lb"/>as Hayagrīva is attributed not to Viṣṇu, but to Yajña.
<div n="lb"/>But the Taittirīya āraṇyaka depicts yajña as a proto-
<div n="lb"/>form of Viṣṇu. The inference that may be drawn from
<div n="lb"/>the above is that the root of the Hayagrīva story
<div n="lb"/>detailed in Vedic and Purāṇic literature is one and the
<div n="lb"/>same.
<div n="NI"/>About the Hayagrīva incarnation the Pañcaviṃsa-
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa contains the following story.
<div n="NI"/>Agni, Indra, Vāyu and Yajña (Viṣṇu) once began a
<div n="lb"/>yajña on the understanding that the havirbhāga
<div n="lb"/>obtained from it should be divided among all the
[Page312-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Devas. But, in violation of the agreement, yajña left
<div n="lb"/>the place carrying away the whole Yajñabhāga with
<div n="lb"/>him, and he drove back the Devas who followed him
<div n="lb"/>with the help of the bow presented to him by Devī.
<div n="lb"/>Finally the Devas got the string of the bow bitten off
<div n="lb"/>by termites and the bow which got straightened up
<div n="lb"/>cut off yajña's head. Yajña then apologized for his
<div n="lb"/>offence and then the devas got the Aśvinīdevas to fix
<div n="lb"/>the head of a horse to the trunk of Yajña. (Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśabrāhmaṇa 7, 5, 6; Taittirīya āraṇyaka 5, 1;
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 4-9, 1).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%In Purāṇic literature.%} The above story is told in
<div n="lb"/>Skanda Purāṇa with slight modifications as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā and other Devatās conducted a test as to
<div n="lb"/>which one amongst them was the greatest, and when
<div n="lb"/>it became evident tha tMahāviṣṇu was, in every respect,
<div n="lb"/>superior to all the others Brahmā cursed that Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>should lose his head. Viṣṇu, who got thus bereft of his
<div n="lb"/>head attended a yajña conducted by the Devas with the
<div n="lb"/>head of a horse attached to his trunk. After the yajña
<div n="lb"/>was over he went to dharmāraṇya and did tapas there
<div n="lb"/>and by the blessings of Śiva got back his former head
<div n="lb"/>instead of that of the horse.
