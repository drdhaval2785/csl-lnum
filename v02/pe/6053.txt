ŚAMBHU IV¦. A Rākṣasa, the son of Vidyujjihva by
<div n="lb"/>Śūrpaṇakhā. Śambhu, who was engaged in tapas in
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍaka forest when Śrī Rāma visited the forest was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by the beauty of Sītā and transformed himself
<div n="lb"/>into a tree to enjoy her beauty with his eyes. Lakṣmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who was felling down trees to build an āśrama felled
<div n="lb"/>this tree also, which disappeared immediately leaving
<div n="lb"/>behind the dead body of a Rākṣasa. It was the corpse
<div n="lb"/>of the Rākṣasa and Rāma comforted Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>by revealing the fact to them. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Araṇyakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Uttara Rāmāyaṇa contains a story of how Devavatī
<div n="lb"/>(or Vedavatī) daughter of Kuśadhvaja once cursed
<div n="lb"/>Śambhu. Devavatī was born from the mouth of
<div n="lb"/>Kuśadhvaja (son of Bṛhaspati) while he was learning
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas. Śambhu wanted to marry the child when
<div n="lb"/>she was grown up, but Kuśadhvaja did not consent to
<div n="lb"/>it, and Śambhu, in retaliation, killed Kuśadhvaja in
<div n="lb"/>his sleep. Next morning Devavatī awoke from sleep to
<div n="lb"/>see the dead body of her father. She cursed Śambhu.
<div n="lb"/>Her curse was a contributory cause for the death of
<div n="lb"/>Śambhu by Lakṣmaṇa.
