BRAHMADATTA IV¦. A king who ruled over the coun-
<div n="lb"/>try of Kāśi. One night he saw two swans flying in the
<div n="lb"/>air. They were of golden colour. There were a num-
<div n="lb"/>ber of swans around them. They seemed like two
<div n="lb"/>lightnings in the midst of white clouds. Brahmadatta
<div n="lb"/>wished to see them again. His desire increased to such
<div n="lb"/>an extent that he had desire for nothing else. He
<div n="lb"/>consulted his ministers and made a lake. Every crea-
<div n="lb"/>ture which seemed beautiful to him was brought to
<div n="lb"/>that place. Hearing this those two swans also came
<div n="lb"/>there. By and by he tamed them and asked them how
<div n="lb"/>they got the golden colour. The swans said thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Oh King! you might have heard of the famous moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain Mandara, which is the field of games of the Devas
<div n="lb"/>(gods). At the time of the churning of the milk sea
<div n="lb"/>when this mountain was used as churn-drill, Amṛtaṃ
<div n="lb"/>(celestial nectar of immortality) touched this moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain. So the flowers, fruits and roots in the vicinity of
<div n="lb"/>this mountain got the power of removing death, wrin-
<div n="lb"/>kles etc. Candracūḍa also will come to this mountain
<div n="lb"/>occasionally to play on the top of it and so it became
<div n="lb"/>more glorious than the mount Kailāsa. One day
<div n="lb"/>while Mahādeva was playing in those gardens he had
<div n="lb"/>to leave on an urgent matter concerning Gods. So he
<div n="lb"/>left Pārvatī there and went away. Devī began to walk
<div n="lb"/>about in those gardens with pangs of separation.
<div n="lb"/>Spring season came. The Gaṇas (servants of Śiva) and
<div n="lb"/>the maids of Pārvatī attended on her. One day Maṇi-
<div n="lb"/>puṣpeśvara, a Gaṇa, hankered after Candralekhā,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Jayā. She had been engaged in fanning
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī. Both were young and their figures suited each
<div n="lb"/>other. Candralekhā reciprocated his love. Under-
<div n="lb"/>standing this Piṅgeśvara and Guheśvara, two gaṇas
<div n="lb"/>looked at each other and smiled. Seeing this Devī
<div n="lb"/>looked round with anger to see what caused them to
<div n="lb"/>smile. They squinted their eyes and showed Manipuṣ-
<div n="lb"/>pe vara and Candralekhā to Devī. Because of separation
<div n="lb"/>she had been much worried, weary and sad. So all
<div n="lb"/>these affairs made her angry. She said: “It is good
<div n="lb"/>that you behave like this when I am in this plight !
<div n="lb"/>The two are making love. Seeing that, you are laughing.
<div n="lb"/>May these two dotards be born on the earth and be-
<div n="lb"/>come husband and wife there. Let you two who
<div n="lb"/>laughed before me without humility also be born on
<div n="lb"/>the earth, first as poor Brāhmaṇas, and then as
<div n="lb"/>Brahmarakṣas (demon friends), outcasts, robbers,
<div n="lb"/>dogs with tails cut off and finally as various kind of
<div n="lb"/>birds.” Thus she cursed the four of gaṇas. Then a
<div n="lb"/>gaṇa named Dhūrjaṭa said to Pārvatī: “Devī, this is
<div n="lb"/>unfortunate. They have not committed any severe
<div n="lb"/>crime.” Devī got angry at him and cursed him too:
<div n="lb"/>“May you also be born on the earth as a human be-
<div n="lb"/>ing.” After this Jaya the loved maid of Pārvatī reques-
<div n="lb"/>ted her for absolution from curse, for all. The Devī
<div n="lb"/>said that all of them would get absolution at the place
<div n="lb"/>of penance of Brahmā and other gods and would re-
<div n="lb"/>turn here. Of these, Candralekhā and her husband and
<div n="lb"/>Dhūrjaṭa would be happy on the earth. The two
<div n="lb"/>others would lead a miserable life on the earth.”
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara, Padmāvatīlaṃbaka, Taraṅga 1).
