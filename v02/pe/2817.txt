JAIGĪṢAVYA¦. A hermit who attained salvation by the
<div n="lb"/>strength of his penance.
<div n="NI"/>It is stated in Harivaṃśa Chapter 18, that three
<div n="lb"/>daughters, Aparṇā, Ekaparṇā and Ekapāṭalā were
<div n="lb"/>born to Himālaya by Menā and the hermit Devala
<div n="lb"/>married Ekaparṇā and the hermit Jaigīṣavya married
<div n="lb"/>Ekapāṭalā. In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>229, mention is made that this hermit gave much
<div n="lb"/>advice to the hermit Devala, son of Asita, about the
<div n="lb"/>need for equanimity. On another occasion this hermit
<div n="lb"/>talked to Yudhiṣṭhira about the glory of Śiva. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 18, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about how this hermit Jaigīṣavya
<div n="lb"/>attained the world of Brahmā. Once he reached the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Devala, who showed the necessary
<div n="lb"/>hospitalities. After a few days this hermit disappeared.
<div n="lb"/>After that he used to be seen only at the time of meals.
<div n="lb"/>Once Devala took his waterpot and went by air to the
<div n="lb"/>sea, to fetch water. When he reached the sea he saw
<div n="lb"/>Jaigīṣavya bathing there. Devala had gone when
<div n="lb"/>Jaigīṣavya was in the hermitage. How did he reach
<div n="lb"/>the sea before Devala? Devala filled the pot and
<div n="lb"/>returned thoughtful. When he reached the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>Jaigīṣavya was there. After this Devala travelled
<div n="lb"/>through the world of the inspired sages. Wherever he
<div n="lb"/>went, he saw Jaigīṣavya. He asked the inspired
<div n="lb"/>sages how it was possible. They praised the attain-
<div n="lb"/>ments, Jaigīṣavya had obtained, by his ‘tapas’
<div n="lb"/>(penance). Finally in the sight of everybody, Jaigīṣavya
<div n="lb"/>flew to the world of Brahmā. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 50).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>11, Stanza 24, that this hermit Jaigīṣavya sits in the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Brahmā and carries on meditation and con-
<div n="lb"/>templation on Brahmā.
