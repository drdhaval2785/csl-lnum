<div n="lb"/>begot three sons, Daṇḍa, Vikukṣi and Nimi. After his
<div n="lb"/>father's death Daṇḍa became king of the country bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween the Vindhya and the Himālayas. In the course
<div n="lb"/>of a hunting expedition once Daṇḍa saw and was imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately attracted by the charms of Arā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Śukra maharṣi. He committed rape on her and she
<div n="lb"/>told her father about the attack by Daṇḍa. The Maha-
<div n="lb"/>rṣi asked his daughter to do tapas, and further told
[Page046-b+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>her that he would burn Daṇḍa's kingdom by a rain of
<div n="lb"/>fire. Arā did tapas, and at the behest of the Maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>Indra destroyed Daṇḍa's kingdom by a downpour of a
<div n="lb"/>rain of fire. Afterwards this place became a terrible
<div n="lb"/>forest where neither birds nor animals lived, and came
<div n="lb"/>to be known as Daṇḍakāraṇya. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
