YĀJÑAVALKYA¦. An ancient sage who was a profound
<div n="lb"/>scholar.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Purāṇas say that this sage spent the major
<div n="lb"/>part of his life at the court of King Janaka. He was
<div n="lb"/>also King Janaka's priest. In Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16,
<div n="lb"/>it is mentioned that Kalki was Yājñavalkya's priest.
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 51,
<div n="lb"/>mentions that Yājñavalkya was a “Brahmavādī son” of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Thousand cows.%} Once King Janaka conducted a
<div n="lb"/>Yāga. At that time he wished to find out the most
<div n="lb"/>eminent among the sages. He promised to present a
<div n="lb"/>thousand cows to the sage who was a consummate
<div n="lb"/>scholar. A bag of gold coins was also tied to each horn
<div n="lb"/>of the cows. Janaka announced that the sage who claim-
<div n="lb"/>ed to be a consummate scholar might come forward and
<div n="lb"/>take the cows with him. No one among the numerous
<div n="lb"/>sages who were present, dared to come forward. Yājña-
<div n="lb"/>valkya, however, ordered his disciple to take the cows
<div n="lb"/>home with him. The other sages questioned his right to
<div n="lb"/>claim the cows. Yājñavalkya asserted his right to do so.
<div n="lb"/>One of the sages named Arthabhāga stood up and
<div n="lb"/>asked him the following question:—
<div n="NI"/>Arthabhāga:—When a man who has not acquired
<div n="lb"/>divine knowledge dies, his “Jñānendriyas” (senses of
<div n="lb"/>knowledge) are also merged with it. How is it possible
<div n="lb"/>for him to accept another body afterwards? “Yājña-
<div n="lb"/>valkya:—Karma (action) becomes the cause of his re-
<div n="lb"/>birth.”
<div n="NI"/>Next Kahola and many other sages put various ques-
<div n="lb"/>tions to him. The substance of their talk is given
<div n="lb"/>below:—
<div n="NI"/>Kahola:—What have you to say about the invisible
<div n="lb"/>and omnipresent Brahman?
<div n="NI"/>Yājñavalkya:—Your soul is the omni-present Brahman.
<div n="lb"/>The soul has no hunger or thirst, fear or desire, old age
<div n="lb"/>or death. Those who wish to know the soul, become
<div n="lb"/>sages after transcending love of wife, children or world-
<div n="lb"/>ly riches. The two qualities essential for sages are
<div n="lb"/>scholarship and spiritual knowledge.
<div n="NI"/>Gārgī:—Who is the warp and woof of everything?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—It is Brahman. Do not ask further; if you do,
<div n="lb"/>your head will be broken to pieces.
<div n="NI"/>Āruṇi:—Who is he who exists within? (Antaryāmī).
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—He who is contained in Jagat (the universe)
<div n="lb"/>without the knowledge of Jagat, he whose body is
<div n="lb"/>Jagat, he who controls Jagat as antaryāmī, he is within
<div n="lb"/>every one. He cannot be seen, but he sees. He cannot
[Page891-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>be heard; but he hears. He is capable of thinking; but
<div n="lb"/>he is beyond our thoughts. He exists as one who sees,
<div n="lb"/>hears and thinks, in all creatures.
<div n="NI"/>Gārgī:—I have two questions to ask. They are as sharp
<div n="lb"/>and pointed as two arrows. By what force is fixed that
<div n="lb"/>which is above Heaven, below the earth and that
<div n="lb"/>which is between them, like warp and woof?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—By the sky.
<div n="NI"/>Gārgī:—By what force is the sky held in position like
<div n="lb"/>warp and woof?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Under the command of God, the sun and
<div n="lb"/>moon do not deviate from their orbits. The sky and the
<div n="lb"/>earth remain in their respective places. Rivers run mak-
<div n="lb"/>ing the fields fertile. One who lives and works without
<div n="lb"/>the ability to know God does not obtain immortality.
<div n="lb"/>He who dies without knowing God is a Kṛpaṇa (spirit-
<div n="lb"/>ual bankrupt). On the contrary, he who knows God
<div n="lb"/>attains Mokṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Śākalya:—How many gods are there?
<div n="NI"/>Yājṅa:—Thirtythree. They are—8 Vasus, 11 Rudras,
<div n="lb"/>12 Ādityas, Indra and Prajāpati. The 8 Vasus are—
<div n="lb"/>Agni, Pṛthvī, Vāyu, Antarīkṣa, Āditya, Dyau (Heaven),
<div n="lb"/>Candra and Stars. The 11 Rudras are the combination
<div n="lb"/>of the 10 jñānendriyas and the working of the mind.
<div n="lb"/>The ruling deities of the 12 months are known as the
<div n="lb"/>12 Ādityas. They receive into them our lives and our
<div n="lb"/>Karmans (actions).
<div n="NI"/>Yājñavalkya gave suitable answers to all other ques-
<div n="lb"/>tions of Śākalya. At last, he asked Śākalya:—“Now I
<div n="lb"/>will ask you a question. Whom do the Upaniṣads
<div n="lb"/>describe? If you do not answer, your head will break.”
<div n="lb"/>Śākalya could not answer it. He dropped down with a
<div n="lb"/>broken head. He asked the other scholars who had
<div n="lb"/>gathered there, if any of them wanted to ask him more
<div n="lb"/>questions. But no one came forward. All remained
<div n="lb"/>dumb. Then he continued:—“Fresh leaves sprout
<div n="lb"/>from a tree which has been cut. If the seed is destroy-
<div n="lb"/>ed, the tree does not grow out of it. How is it that a
<div n="lb"/>man is born again after his death?”
<div n="NI"/>No one was able to answer that question. Thus after
<div n="lb"/>defeating all of them in argument, Yājñavalkya went
<div n="lb"/>home with the cows.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%In Janaka's court again.%} On another occasion,
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya went to see King Janaka. The King asked
<div n="lb"/>him whether he had come for getting cows or to ask
<div n="lb"/>abstruse question. The sage answered that he had come
<div n="lb"/>for both. Their conversation continued as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Jita Muni has said that “Vacana” (word) is
<div n="lb"/>Brahman or God. What is your opinion?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—It is correct. But did he say which is the body
<div n="lb"/>and abode of God?
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—No.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—In that case he has said only onefourth about
<div n="lb"/>God. Vacana is god's body and sky, his abode. Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>vidyā depends on the word. The word is Parabrahman.
<div n="lb"/>Janaka was highly pleased. He decided to give a thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand bulls to the sage. But Yājñavalkya said that his
<div n="lb"/>father's principle was to give effective knowledge to the
<div n="lb"/>pupil and not to receive any dakṣiṇā (Payment) from
<div n="lb"/>him. Janaka again wanted Yājñavalkya to explain
<div n="lb"/>clearly what “Brahma Vidyā” means.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Just as a person can reach his destination by
<div n="lb"/>walking or by travelling in a chariot or by sailing in a
<div n="lb"/>boat, in order to secure peace for the soul, you are
<div n="lb"/>depending on the Upaniṣads. But although one is
[Page892-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>learned in Vedas and Āgamas, or adored by others or
<div n="lb"/>wealthy, or well-versed in Upaniṣads, unless one has
<div n="lb"/>known God—unless one acquired Brahmajñāna—one
<div n="lb"/>cannot be said to be gratified. Do you know where you
<div n="lb"/>will go after renouncing your body?
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—I do not know.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—I shall tell you. The deity of the right eye is
<div n="lb"/>“Inda” (light). People call it “Indra”. The deity of
<div n="lb"/>the left eye is Indrāṇī, the wife of Indra. Indra is eater
<div n="lb"/>and Indrāṇī is food. In a state of consciousness they
<div n="lb"/>are separated. (Then the soul is called Vaiśvānara).
<div n="lb"/>In a state of dream, the two are united. (Then the
<div n="lb"/>soul is called Taijasa). In a state of slumber, the soul
<div n="lb"/>is in “Prjñāa” state. (Since there is no activity it is
<div n="lb"/>called Prājña). In the fourth or “Turīya” state, one
<div n="lb"/>becomes capable of transcending the three other states
<div n="lb"/>and to attain Parabrahman. It is a state of fearlessness
<div n="lb"/>transcending birth and death.
<div n="NI"/>The King who was pleased by this teaching dedicated
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom of Videha and even himself to the sage.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%In Janaka's court for the third time.%} After some years
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya went again to Janaka's court. At that time
<div n="lb"/>also there was a philosophical discussion between the
<div n="lb"/>King and the sage in the form of questions and answers.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Which is the light that gives us guidance
<div n="lb"/>during the day time?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—The Sun.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—After sunset which is the light that guides us?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—The Moon.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—And in the absence of the sun and moon?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Agni.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Which is the light that guides us in the
<div n="lb"/>absence of the sun, moon and Agni?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Vacana.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Which is the light that shines in the absence
<div n="lb"/>of all these luminaries?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Ātmajyotis (soul's light).
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Who is Ātman?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—“Puruṣa” who is formed by the union of
<div n="lb"/>“vyāna” in prāṇas (lives) and jyotis (light) in the
<div n="lb"/>heart. The soul is disposed to action with the help of
<div n="lb"/>intelligence. In the end it transcends the body, senses
<div n="lb"/>and mind and attains Mokṣa. In the state of conscious-
<div n="lb"/>ness the soul's activities become manifest to us. When
<div n="lb"/>in sleep, after deputing “Prāṇa” for the protection of
<div n="lb"/>the body, the soul remains outside the body. The senses
<div n="lb"/>become inactive. Therefore we should never wake up
<div n="lb"/>one who is asleep. When the soul remains in the body
<div n="lb"/>and the senses are active, it is in a most vigilant state.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the soul is above the states of wakefulness, dream
<div n="lb"/>and slumber. The soul is the divine light of pure
<div n="lb"/>energy.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka who was pleased, gave the sage a thousand
<div n="lb"/>cows more. After that Yājñavalkya spoke about libera-
<div n="lb"/>tion from worldly bonds.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—The soul has no connection with the three
<div n="lb"/>conditions. Just as the actions in a dream do not affect
<div n="lb"/>the soul, the actions in a wakeful state also do not
<div n="lb"/>affect it. Just as a fish jumps from one side of the river
<div n="lb"/>to the other and back again, life keeps jumping from
<div n="lb"/>the state of wakefulness to the state of slumber and vice
<div n="lb"/>versa.
<div n="NI"/>Just as a kite goes up flying and then comes back to its
<div n="lb"/>nest, one moves from the state of wakefulness to sleep
<div n="lb"/>and back again. In deep slumber, he merges with God,
[Page892-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>but he does not know that. In that state, the father or
<div n="lb"/>the mother does not have the knowledge that they are
<div n="lb"/>the father or mother.
<div n="NI"/>After that Yājñavalkya explained the nature of the soul
<div n="lb"/>and the various aspects of its working in a state of wake-
<div n="lb"/>fulness and of slumber. He added:—“As long as there
<div n="lb"/>is “Kāma” (desire) there is “Karman” also. Life goes
<div n="lb"/>on passing from birth to death and from death to birth.
<div n="lb"/>One attains perfection when one is above all desires,
<div n="lb"/>and acquires the highest divine knowledge. He is liber-
<div n="lb"/>ated from birth and death and becomes immortal.
<div n="NI"/>By jñāna, dāna and tapas we become self-purified and
<div n="lb"/>thus become worthy of the highest divine grace. We
<div n="lb"/>have to go from the world of Karman (action) to the
<div n="lb"/>world of ātman (soul). One who has acquired Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>jñāna (knowledge of Brahman) becomes a Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing these famous teachings of Yājñavalkya, Janaka
<div n="lb"/>became his permanent disciple.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%His end.%} Yājñavalkya had two wives named Kalyāṇī
<div n="lb"/>and Maitreyī. After giving his all to his wives he passed
<div n="lb"/>into immortality. (Bṛhadāraṇyaka; M.B. Śānṭi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 3-9).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%His works.%} Yājñavalkya has written a Smṛti on the
<div n="lb"/>subject of law. “Mitākṣarā” is its famous commentary.
<div n="lb"/>Mitākṣarā is the highest authoritative treatise on Law
<div n="lb"/>in South India.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Yājñavalkya flourished in Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) He was also a member of Indra's assembly. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Yājñavalkya was the priest at the Rājasūya Yajña
<div n="lb"/>of Dharmaputra. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 33,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 35).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Yājñavalkya had his knowledge of Vedas from
<div n="lb"/>Sūryadeva. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 318, Verse 6).
