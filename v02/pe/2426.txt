GHOṢĀ¦. A tapasvinī famed in Ṛgveda. She was the
<div n="lb"/>grand-daughter of Dṛgata maharṣi and daughter of sage
<div n="lb"/>Kakṣīvān. As she contracted leprosy in her very child-
<div n="lb"/>hood nobody came forward to marry her. Ultimately
<div n="lb"/>she composed a mantra in praise of Aśvinīdevas. They
<div n="lb"/>cured Ghoṣā of leprosy and she got married. (Ṛgveda,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 7, Sūkta 117).
