PĀRVATĪ¦. Wife of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Pārvatī is known under different names and worshipped

<div n="NI"/>Umā, Kātyāyanī, Gaurī, Kālī, Haimavatī, Īśvarī,
<div n="lb"/>Śivā, Bhavānī, Rudrāṇī, Śarvāṇī, Sarvamaṅgalā,

<div n="lb"/>Dākṣāyaṇī, Girijā, Menakātmajā, Cāmuṇḍā, Karṇa-
<div n="lb"/>moṭī, Carccikā, Bhairavī.
<div n="NI"/>Some of these names refer to the various dispositions of
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī, while a few are the names in the various incar-
<div n="lb"/>nations of Pārvatī. The origin of Pārvatī and her
<div n="lb"/>other prominent births are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Incarnation of Satī.%} Śiva was born from Brahmā. To
<div n="lb"/>make Śiva active, Satī, an aspect of Mahāmāyā, was
<div n="lb"/>born as the daughter of Dakṣa, one of the Prajāpatis.
<div n="lb"/>The 9th Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata gives the following
<div n="lb"/>story about the incarnation of Satī:
<div n="NI"/>While Brahmā was engaged in creation a few daityas
<div n="lb"/>named Hālāhalas were born. They were very valiant
<div n="lb"/>and ferocious and they did penance to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and after obtaining boons from him conquered
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds and asserted their supremacy in all the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds. They defied the Trimūrtis (trio of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva). Śiva and Viṣṇu in despair went to
<div n="lb"/>war against them. The war continued for sixty thousand
<div n="lb"/>years and both the daityas and Devas were exhausted.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva refused to attend to their duties. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>understood the situation and taking into his hands the
<div n="lb"/>work of Śiva and Viṣṇu also and calling his sons,
<div n="lb"/>Sanaka and others to his side said “Oh sons, Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu are incapable of doing their work now, I have
<div n="lb"/>therefore, taken on myself the charge of their duties also
<div n="lb"/>and hence I do not find time to do penance. You must
<div n="lb"/>therefore, do penance to propitiate Mahāmāyā. Let
<div n="lb"/>her be pleased and when she incarnates in this universe
<div n="lb"/>the world will be happy.”
<div n="NI"/>As soon as they heard this the Prajāpatis headed by
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa went to the forests on the side of the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>They started doing penance reciting the mantra of
<div n="lb"/>Māyābīja. The penance lasted for a hundred thousand
<div n="lb"/>years and then the goddess was pleased. She graciously
<div n="lb"/>appeared before them with three eyes and four hands
[Page576-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>bearing pāśa, aṅkuśa, vara and abhīti. Dakṣa and others
<div n="lb"/>praised her and she granted them boons. She did also
<div n="lb"/>promise to be born as the daughter of Dakṣa. Dakṣa and
<div n="lb"/>others returned happy.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāmāyā incarnated as Satī in the house of Dakṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Satī blossomed into a beautiful maiden and all the
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpatis joined together and made Śiva marry her.
<div n="lb"/>The bride and bridegroom lived in the bride's house.
<div n="NI"/>At that time the sage Durvāsas worshipped Jagadambikā
<div n="lb"/>seated at Jāmbūnada meditating on her and reciting the
<div n="lb"/>māyābīja mantra. The devī was immensely pleased and
<div n="lb"/>appearing before him gave him the divine garland lying
<div n="lb"/>round her neck. The garland was highly perfumed.
<div n="lb"/>Honey flowed from it always. Wearing that garland the
<div n="lb"/>sage travelled through air and reached the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa, father of Satī, and gave that garland to him.
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa received it with great delight and took it to his
<div n="lb"/>bed-room and placed it there. That night Dakṣa inhal-
<div n="lb"/>ed the perfume of the divine garland and enjoyed an
<div n="lb"/>amorous sport with his wife. This act made the garland
<div n="lb"/>impure and the latent curse in it made Dakṣa hate his
<div n="lb"/>daughter Satī and her husband Śiva. After that Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>conducted a Yāga and insulted Śiva by not inviting
<div n="lb"/>either him or his wife. Satī, however, attended the Yāga
<div n="lb"/>uninvited and she was insulted. Unable to bear the in-
<div n="lb"/>sult Satī leapt into the fire and committed suicide. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards Śiva roamed about in the world
<div n="lb"/>crying “Satī, Satī.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Satī, Pārvatī (Kālī).%} During that time a son named
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāṅga was born to Kaśyapa of his wife Diti. This
<div n="lb"/>virtuous asura practised austerities for a thousand
<div n="lb"/>years and when he opened his eyes after his long penance
<div n="lb"/>he did not see his wife. Vajrāṅga started in search
<div n="lb"/>of her collecting fruits and roots for his food on
<div n="lb"/>the way. Then he came across her standing underneath
<div n="lb"/>a tree weeping and she said: “All the time you were
<div n="lb"/>doing penance, Indra was teasing me. I was living
<div n="lb"/>without food on the banks of the river keeping a vow of
<div n="lb"/>silence. Indra came there in the form of a monkey and
<div n="lb"/>threw away all my articles used for worship. Then he
<div n="lb"/>came in the form of a lion and frightened me. Then
<div n="lb"/>again he came in the form of a serpent and bit me. Oh
<div n="lb"/>lord, am I, your wife, an orphan?” Vajrāṅga got angry
<div n="lb"/>and decided to do penance again to find a remedy for
<div n="lb"/>this unjust act of Indra. Then Brahmā coming to know
<div n="lb"/>of the fierce decision of Vajrāṅga appeared before him
<div n="lb"/>and said “Why do you go in for a penance again? Ask
<div n="lb"/>me what you want and I shall grant you.” Vajrāṅga
<div n="lb"/>said “Oh Lord, I did penance all these thousand years
<div n="lb"/>to get rid of the demoniac disposition of mine. But
<div n="lb"/>when I was engaged in meditation Indra tormented my
<div n="lb"/>virtuous wife very much without any reason. If you will
<div n="lb"/>bless me I must get a son named Tāraka to kill all the
<div n="lb"/>devas including Indra.” Brahmā granted the boon.
<div n="NI"/>Varāṅgī became pregnant and after twelve months was
<div n="lb"/>born a son to her named Tārakāsura. Tāraka did severe
<div n="lb"/>penance sitting in the midst of Pañcāgni (five fires) for
<div n="lb"/>a long time and Brahmā was pleased and appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him. Tāraka then said: “If I were to die I must
<div n="lb"/>die at the hands of a seven-day-old babe. You must
<div n="lb"/>grant me a boon like that.” Brahmā granted the boon.
<div n="lb"/>Tāraka became arrogant with that boon and joined
<div n="lb"/>hands with such fierce demons as Prasena, Jambha and
<div n="lb"/>Kālanemi to create havoc in the three worlds of Svarga,
[Page577-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmi and Pātāla. They blessed the wicked and killed
<div n="lb"/>the virtuous. It was the time when Śiva was sadly roam-
<div n="lb"/>ing about in search of his lost wife Satī.
<div n="NI"/>All the devas headed by Indra went and complained to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Brahmā said:—“After all, this calamity is not
<div n="lb"/>without remedy. There is an escape from the boon I
<div n="lb"/>have given him. Tārakāsura himself has allowed him
<div n="lb"/>to be killed by a sevenday-old babe. If there should be
<div n="lb"/>such a babe it should be from the virility of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura thinks that since Śiva is observing brahma-
<div n="lb"/>carya after the death of Satī there is no chance of a babe
<div n="lb"/>being born to him. That was why he was prepared to
<div n="lb"/>allow that clause in that boon. I shall therefore suggest
<div n="lb"/>a plan. Satī herself should be born as the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Himavān and Menā in the name of Kālī. Kālī should
<div n="lb"/>do great penance and break the vow of celibacy of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>If Śiva accepts her as his wife and a child is born to
<div n="lb"/>them we are saved.”
<div n="NI"/>Śiva was all this time spending his time thinking of
<div n="lb"/>Satī. Once during this time Śiva bathed in the river
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī and then the waters of the river Kālindī be-
<div n="lb"/>came black and the waters remained black ever since
<div n="lb"/>that.
<div n="NI"/>Indra and others on their return from Brahmā went to
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati to think about further procedure in the
<div n="lb"/>matter. Bṛhaspati said:—“No obstacle would ever come
<div n="lb"/>to any act of the devas. Himavān was doing penance
<div n="lb"/>for a long time to obtain a child and by the grace of Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>Satī has already been born as the daughter of Himavān.
<div n="lb"/>(Skanda Purāṇa in its Sambhava Kāṇḍa states thus
<div n="lb"/>about the birth of Satī as Pārvatī. “Satī before
<div n="lb"/>jumping into the fire meditated on Śiva and prayed
<div n="lb"/>that she should be born in her next birth as his wife.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva granted that request. It was at that time that Hima-
<div n="lb"/>vān along with his wife Menā went to the vicinity of
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtasaras and started doing penance to get a child.
<div n="lb"/>One day when Himavān and his wife were bathing in
<div n="lb"/>the saras they saw a gem of a girl in the waters and
<div n="lb"/>they took it. Then they found the child with four hands
<div n="lb"/>and all other emblems of goddess on her. They praised
<div n="lb"/>her with verses from Vedas and soon the divine emblems
<div n="lb"/>faded away and Himavān gave the child to his wife.”)
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā never wanted Tāraka to know that the child
<div n="lb"/>was an incarnation of Devī and so he made the
<div n="lb"/>babe black by sending Niśā to do so. Niśā entered the
<div n="lb"/>womb of the pregnant Menā while she was sleeping with
<div n="lb"/>her mouth open one day. The child was like a sapphire idol.
<div n="lb"/>Himavān was surprised to see the child. The child will
<div n="lb"/>do severe penance and obtain Śiva as her husband. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and Satī will never be separated in any of their births.
<div n="lb"/>Oh Indra now go and try to get Śiva interested in a
<div n="lb"/>married life.”
<div n="NI"/>Himavān and Menā had three daughters and a son.
<div n="lb"/>The devas were watching who among the three—Rāgiṇī,
<div n="lb"/>Kuṭilā and Kālī—would become the consort of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>All the three were interested in penance. The devas
<div n="lb"/>took Rāgiṇī to Brahmaloka and showed her to Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and the latter declared that Rāgiṇī was incapable of
<div n="lb"/>bearing the virility of Śiva. Rāgiṇī got angry and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā cursed her and made her into Sandhyārāga
<div n="lb"/>and she took her place in the sky. Then the devas took
<div n="lb"/>Kuṭilā to Brahmā and the latter said that she was
<div n="lb"/>also incapable of being a mate of Śiva. Kuṭilā also
<div n="lb"/>got angry and Brahmā made her into a river and kept
<div n="lb"/>her in Brahmaloka. Menā was greatly distressed at
[Page577-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the loss of her two daughters and so she advised Kālī,
<div n="lb"/>her third daughter to go home, discontinuing the
<div n="lb"/>penance. She at first said Umā (Mā = do not) and so
<div n="lb"/>she got the name of Umā She was the daughter of a
<div n="lb"/>Parvata (Himavān is a parvata (mountaiṇ) and so she
<div n="lb"/>got the name Pārvatī (mountain-girl) also. Kālī later
<div n="lb"/>went home. But after some time the natural inclination
<div n="lb"/>in her led her to start a severe penance again.
<div n="NI"/>The young Kālī, who was only a small girl then, accom-
<div n="lb"/>panied by two of her girl companions went to the shores
<div n="lb"/>of a river deep in the forests and started practising
<div n="lb"/>austerities. In summer she would sit in the midst of
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāgni (five fires) and in the rainy season she would
<div n="lb"/>sit in water and do penance. The penance lasted for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva who was roaming about in search of Satī went once
<div n="lb"/>to the palace of Himavān. Śiva agreed to stay there for
<div n="lb"/>some time at the persistent request of Himavān. During
<div n="lb"/>his stay there Śiva understood that one of the daughters
<div n="lb"/>of his host was doing penance meditating on Śaṅkara.
<div n="lb"/>Curious to know more about her, Śiva one day went
<div n="lb"/>to the āśrama of Kālī. Kālī saw Śiva and she stood up
<div n="lb"/>bowing before him. Śiva was pleased with her. But
<div n="lb"/>before Kālī could have another look at Śiva, he vanished
<div n="lb"/>from there.
<div n="NI"/>Kālī was disappointed and continued her penance again.
<div n="lb"/>Years went by and one day there came to her āśrama
<div n="lb"/>a Vaṭu (a brahmin brahmacārī). Kālī and her companions
<div n="lb"/>stood up and worshipped the Vaṭu who looked brilliant
<div n="lb"/>with ashes on his body and wearing rudrākṣa and
<div n="lb"/>akṣamālā (berry of a tree and rosary made of it) and
<div n="lb"/>carrying in his hand a daṇḍa (stick) and a Kamaṇḍalu
<div n="lb"/>(water pot). After formal introduction the Vaṭu asked
<div n="lb"/>Kālī the purpose of her penance and Kālī told him all
<div n="lb"/>about it. Then the Vaṭu asked her in tones of surprise
<div n="lb"/>why such a beautiful girl like herself born to be the wife
<div n="lb"/>of a king, should go after a crudely dressed aged man
<div n="lb"/>like Śiva who goes on the back of a bullock always.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī resented the statement of the Vaṭu and got
<div n="lb"/>angry with him. Then Śiva appeared before her in his
<div n="lb"/>real form and married Pārvatī (Kālī alias Umā) in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of devas and maharṣis.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Pārvatī changes into Gaurī.%} Śiva and Pārvatī spent
<div n="lb"/>their honeymoon travelling throughout the world. Years
<div n="lb"/>went by like that. One day Śiva in a spirit of sport
<div n="lb"/>called Pārvatī ‘Kālī, Kālī’. Kālī meant black one and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī was as black as sapphire. Pārvatī misunderstood
<div n="lb"/>Śiva addressing her thus two times and thought, perhaps,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva did not like her black body and trembling with
<div n="lb"/>grief said “If a wound is made by an arrow it will heal
<div n="lb"/>in due course; if the top of a tree is chopped off it will
<div n="lb"/>again blossom when the season comes; but the wound in
<div n="lb"/>the minds of others by harsh words is never healed. It was
<div n="lb"/>not my fault that I was born black and I would never again
<div n="lb"/>come near you with this black body. I am going.” Saying
<div n="lb"/>thus with a firm determination, she rose up into the air and
<div n="lb"/>travelling for some time reached a big forest. She creat-
<div n="lb"/>ed by her reciting the smaraṇamantra four attendants
<div n="lb"/>for her named Somaprabhā, Jayā, Vijayā and Jayantī
<div n="lb"/>and started doing penance there. She practised severe
<div n="lb"/>austerities standing on one foot for a hundred years and
<div n="lb"/>then Brahmā appeared before her and sought the reason
<div n="lb"/>why Pārvatī, wife of Parameśvara should do such severe
<div n="lb"/>penance and then she narrated to him all that had
<div n="lb"/>happened. Brahmā after hearing her story told her thus:—
[Page578-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>“Virtuous woman, from today onwards, your black com-
<div n="lb"/>plexion would change into one of the hue of a lotus
<div n="lb"/>petal. Because of that ‘gaura’ hue you would be called
<div n="lb"/>‘Gaurī’.” By the time Brahmā finished blessing her the
<div n="lb"/>colour changed into the one described by Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gaurī changes into Kātyāyanī, Vindhyavāsinī, Caṇḍikā and%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Cāmuṇḍikā.%} When Devī became Gaurī her superficial
<div n="lb"/>skin peeled off and dropped down, it is said.
<div n="NI"/>At that time there were two great demons called
<div n="lb"/>Rambha and Karambha. They had no sons and they
<div n="lb"/>started severe penance. Karambha was doing penance
<div n="lb"/>standing in deep waters and a crocodile swallowed him.
<div n="lb"/>The crocodile was none other than Indra. Rambha did
<div n="lb"/>penance standing in the midst of fire and finding no
<div n="lb"/>result even after a long time decided to sacrifice himself
<div n="lb"/>into the fire. Agnideva then appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>blessed him thus: “Oh Rambha, you will get a mighty
<div n="lb"/>son of the woman you love.” Rambha stopped his
<div n="lb"/>penance and returned home with the boon. On the way
<div n="lb"/>he saw a beautiful she-buffalo and passion rose in him
<div n="lb"/>and he made contacts with the buffalo. The buffalo be-
<div n="lb"/>came pregnant and in due course delivered a child
<div n="lb"/>which later on became the notorious Mahiṣāsura. In
<div n="lb"/>the meantime a buffalo loved Mahiṣāsura's mother and
<div n="lb"/>it attacked Rambha and gored him to death. The
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas burnt his dead body in a funeral pyre and the
<div n="lb"/>she-buffalo jumped into the pyre and abandoned her
<div n="lb"/>life. From that pyre there arose then another demon
<div n="lb"/>and he was the notorious Raktabīja. Mahiṣāsura became
<div n="lb"/>the king of demons and Raktabīja, Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>became his ministers. They attacked the devas and drove
<div n="lb"/>them to exhaustion. The devas took refuge in Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>to think of a plan to kill those asuras. Viṣṇu, and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>took part in the conference. Viṣṇu the eternal, got
<div n="lb"/>angry along with Śiva and became fierce like the fire
<div n="lb"/>of death. Brahmā and the devas also became angry and
<div n="lb"/>from the face of everyone a brilliance emanated and all
<div n="lb"/>these brilliances joined together and reached the holy
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Kātyāyana maharṣi and that eminent sage
<div n="lb"/>also sent out a brilliance. The ascetic brilliance joined
<div n="lb"/>with the divine brilliance and the combined brilliance
<div n="lb"/>shone like a thousand suns. Then this superior brilliance
<div n="lb"/>entered the peeled-off skin of Kālī to produce the
<div n="lb"/>fierce and divine form of a goddess named Kātyāyanī.
<div n="lb"/>Each limb of the new form was made up of the brillian-
<div n="lb"/>ce from a particular god as follows: From the brilliance
<div n="lb"/>of Mahendra was formed the face; from Agni, the eyes;
<div n="lb"/>from Yama, the hair; from Viṣṇu, the eighteen hands;
<div n="lb"/>from Indra, the central parts; from Varuṇa, the hip
<div n="lb"/>and the thighs; from Brahmā, the feet; from Sūrya,
<div n="lb"/>the toes; from Prajāpati, the teeth; from Vasus, the
<div n="lb"/>fingers of the hands; from Yakṣa, the nose; from Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>the ears and from the ascetic brilliance, the erotic eyebrows.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Kātyāyanī shone in the world with a figure formed
<div n="lb"/>with distinctive perfection.
<div n="NI"/>All the gods and devas presented Kātyāyanī with gifts:—
<div n="lb"/>Śiva gave her a trident (triśūla); Viṣṇu a Discus;
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, a conch; Agni, a javelin; Vāyu, a bow; Sūrya,
<div n="lb"/>a never-empty quiver; Indra, Vajraghaṇṭā; Yama,
<div n="lb"/>a daṇḍa (stick); Vaiśravaṇa, a mace; Brahmā, a rosary
<div n="lb"/>garland; Kāla, a sword and shield; Candra, Cāmara
<div n="lb"/>(white brush-like fan) and a pearl necklace; Ocean
<div n="lb"/>a garland; Himavān, a lion; Viśvakarmā, a moon-
<div n="lb"/>disced Cūḍāmaṇi, earrings and a dagger; the King of
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas, a silver-plated drinking cup; the King of
[Page578-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>nāgas, a nāgahāra; and the Ṛtus (seasons), never-
<div n="lb"/>fading flowers. The three-eyed Kātyāyanī on getting
<div n="lb"/>all these was highly pleased and made a roaring sound.
<div n="lb"/>Devī, thus worshipped and adored by all, mounted on
<div n="lb"/>the lion and went to the topmost peak of the Vindhyas.
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Agni went and served Kātyāyanī thus living
<div n="lb"/>there. Vindhya called Devī, Kauśikī and Agastya
<div n="lb"/>called her Durgā.
<div n="NI"/>Mahiṣāsura once went to the Vindhyas after conquering
<div n="lb"/>all the three worlds. He was accompanied by his
<div n="lb"/>ministers, Raktabīja, Caṇḍa, Muṇḍa, Cikṣura and
<div n="lb"/>Naraka. They met there the goddess Kātyāyanī.
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣāsura fell in love with the beautiful and well-
<div n="lb"/>figured Kātyāyanī and he sent Dundubhi as messenger
<div n="lb"/>to the goddess to make her know his desire. Dundubhi
<div n="lb"/>approached Kātyāyanī and told her to become the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Mahiṣa, the emperor of all the three worlds. Devī
<div n="lb"/>replied that she would accept as her husband one who
<div n="lb"/>defeated her and that was the custom also in her
<div n="lb"/>caste. Mahiṣāsura with a huge army and heavy equip-
<div n="lb"/>ments went to war with her. But Kātyāyanī entered
<div n="lb"/>the field alone mounted on her lion and the devas
<div n="lb"/>watching her enter the battlefield without wearing
<div n="lb"/>even an armour were shocked. Devī went forward
<div n="lb"/>reciting the mantra of Viṣṇupañcākṣara given to her
<div n="lb"/>by Śiva and lakhs and lakhs of demons were killed by
<div n="lb"/>the adroit sword-swinging and the dinning roar of
<div n="lb"/>Kātyāyanī. Mahiṣa and his ministers surrounded her
<div n="lb"/>and Devī stepping down from the lion started to dance
<div n="lb"/>wielding her sword. Swinging her sword to the rhythm
<div n="lb"/>of her dance-steps Devī picked up the leading demons
<div n="lb"/>one by one and killed them. Seeing that, Mahiṣāsura
<div n="lb"/>approached her, burning with rage like the pralayāgni.
<div n="lb"/>All the attendants of Devī fled. Those who remained
<div n="lb"/>were trampled to death by Mahiṣāsura. Devī at first
<div n="lb"/>killed the ministers and then faced Mahiṣāsura. Mahiṣa
<div n="lb"/>became an elephant and Devī cut off its trunk. The
<div n="lb"/>elephant became a buffalo then. Devī sent a spike and
<div n="lb"/>it broke. Even Devī's Discus, granted to her by Viṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>blunted when it hit the rock-like body of Mahiṣāsura.
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇapāśa, Yamadaṇḍa and Indravajra were all
<div n="lb"/>alike fruitless against the mighty Mahiṣāsura. Angered
<div n="lb"/>Devī jumped on the buffalo form of the demon and
<div n="lb"/>drove it to exhaustion and when at last its power of
<div n="lb"/>resistance had failed, Devī plunged her spear into the
<div n="lb"/>ears of the buffalo and the demon fell dead.
<div n="NI"/>Many years went by. Kaśyapa begot of his wife Danu
<div n="lb"/>three great sons named Śumbha, Niśumbha and Namuci.
<div n="lb"/>All were fierce demons. Namuci attacked Indra but
<div n="lb"/>they soon came to a compromise. But Indra hid in the
<div n="lb"/>foam of the ocean which entered the ears, nose and
<div n="lb"/>mouth of Namuci while he was playing in the ocean.
<div n="lb"/>Indra used his Vajrāyudha from inside and killed him.
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha and Niśumbha were angry and they entered
<div n="lb"/>svarga and defeating everyone there, carried all the
<div n="lb"/>riches from there to the earth. They met Raktabīja and
<div n="lb"/>he said “Oh Lords, I am Raktabīja, minister of Mahi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣāsura. Kātyāyanī Devī killed virtuous Mahiṣāsura.
<div n="lb"/>His two ministers Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa are hiding inside
<div n="lb"/>the ocean afraid of Kātyāyanī devī.” While he was speak-
<div n="lb"/>ing thus Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa also came there. When
<div n="lb"/>they all exchanged ideas Śumbha called one of his men
<div n="lb"/>and said “Bho: Sugrīvāsura, go and tell Kātyāyanī to
<div n="lb"/>be my wife.” Sugrīva went to Kātyāyanī and returned
<div n="lb"/>disappointed and said “Lords Śumbha and Niśumbha,
[Page579-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>I told Devī your message and she only laughed. She
<div n="lb"/>said that Śumbha and Niśumha might be mighty lords
<div n="lb"/>but only those who defeated her could marry her.”
<div n="NI"/>Enraged at this arrogance of Kātyāyanī, Śumbha sent
<div n="lb"/>Dhūmrākṣa to drag Kātyāyanī down to him. Dhūmrākṣa
<div n="lb"/>with six Akṣauhiṇīs of soldiers went to the seat of
<div n="lb"/>Kātyāyanī and challenged her to a fight. Devī stepped
<div n="lb"/>down from her seat and stood before Dhūmrākṣa and
<div n="lb"/>the latter leaped forward to catch hold of her. But
<div n="lb"/>Dhūmrākṣa was burnt to death by the huṃkāra fire
<div n="lb"/>of the goddess. Not only that, the huṃkāra sound
<div n="lb"/>reached the ears of Śumbha. Śumbha felt small by this
<div n="lb"/>prowess of the Devī but his rage increased. Śumbha
<div n="lb"/>then sent Caṇḍa, Muṇḍa and the great demon Ruru
<div n="lb"/>also with an army of a hundred crores of demons to
<div n="lb"/>face Devī Kauśikī. When the enemies reached Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>the bhūtas of Devī made loud and shrill noises. The
<div n="lb"/>lion of Kātyāyanī roared and she leaped into the midst
<div n="lb"/>of the army sword in hand. Lakhs and lakhs of asuras
<div n="lb"/>fell dead by the sword of the goddess. Devī once opened
<div n="lb"/>her mouth and lakhs of asuras entered it and then she
<div n="lb"/>shut her mouth keeping in her stomach the asuras till
<div n="lb"/>they all died. Devī beat the demon Ruru to death.
<div n="lb"/>Devī plucked her matted hair and struck it on the
<div n="lb"/>ground and from there arose the fierce form of Cāmuṇḍī.
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa fled but Cāmuṇḍī followed them to
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla and catching hold of them chopped off their
<div n="lb"/>heads and presented them to Kātyāyanī. Then Devī,
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī and the bhūtas together tore to pieces all the
<div n="lb"/>remaining asuras and stored them all in their stomachs.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this Śumbha's rage knew no bounds and he
<div n="lb"/>started with an army of thirty crores of men. The army
<div n="lb"/>swept on like an ocean and finding it moving forward
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī roared. Kātyāyanī made a sound like a lion's
<div n="lb"/>roar. Brahmāṇī holding high the dagger jumped down to
<div n="lb"/>fight. Māheśvarī with snakes and the spike, with the
<div n="lb"/>three eyes open got down in fits of anger. Kaumārī
<div n="lb"/>with the javelin hanging round her waist and bright
<div n="lb"/>eyes entered the field. Vaiṣṇavī swinging her sword and
<div n="lb"/>whirling the mace with many weapons rushed to the
<div n="lb"/>field. Vārāhī breaking open the earth with its tusk and
<div n="lb"/>bearing a large wooden pestle came to fight. Indrāṇī
<div n="lb"/>with diamond on her sides came to fight. Nārasiṃhī
<div n="lb"/>brushing the manes on her breast, shaking the stars and
<div n="lb"/>whirling the planets and making a fierce appearance
<div n="lb"/>came to the field. (Cāmuṇḍī, Brahmāṇī, Māhesvarī,
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī and Nārasiṃhī are the different forms
<div n="lb"/>of Kātyāyanī. They are called Saptamātṛs (seven
<div n="lb"/>mothers). These saptamātṛs were born when-Kātyāyanī
<div n="lb"/>in her wrath beat the earth with her matted hair).
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī roared. The world became dark. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the roar Śiva descended to the field. The Asuras
<div n="lb"/>surrounded the Devī again. But they all fell dead with
<div n="lb"/>blood flowing in a stream. The dead bodies of the
<div n="lb"/>asuras became heaped up and in despair Śumbha and
<div n="lb"/>Niśumbha wept. Seeing that, Raktabīja got angry and
<div n="lb"/>rushed at Devī. The Saptamātṛs shouted and Cāmuṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>opened her mouth. The lower jaw of Cāmuṇḍī touched
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla when she opened her mouth from the sky.
<div n="lb"/>Raktabīja, wounded and bleeding by a dagger stroke of
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī, fell into the mouth of Cāmuṇḍī and dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared. Then Niśumbha interfered and the fight be-
<div n="lb"/>came one between Niśumbha and Devī. The fat and sturdy
<div n="lb"/>hands of Niśumbha and the mace he was carrying fell
<div n="lb"/>by an arrow sent by Devī. Then Devī struck him with
[Page579-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>her spike and Niśumbha was killed. Both Śumbha and
<div n="lb"/>Niśumbha who came to wreak vengeance on her were
<div n="lb"/>thus killed. (See under Laṅkālakṣmī to know how Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>became Laṅkālakṣmī).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Pārvatī takes the forms of Elephant and monkey.%} Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and Pārvatī went about enjoying amorous sports in the
<div n="lb"/>forests. Śiva turned himself into a tusker and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>became a she-elephant then. Gaṇapati was born as a
<div n="lb"/>result of that sport. Śiva became a monkey and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>became his mate and Hanūmān was born as a result
<div n="lb"/>of that sport. (See under Gaṇapati and Hanūmān).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Pārvatī became Sītā.%} This happened when Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa along with Sītā were in the forests. One day
<div n="lb"/>Sītā went to the Godāvarī river nearby to bring water
<div n="lb"/>to the āśrama and she stayed for some time watching
<div n="lb"/>two swans playing in the midst of lotuses in the lake
<div n="lb"/>there. Hearing a sound she looked into the river and
<div n="lb"/>saw Śrī Rāma bathing there. She was surprised. When
<div n="lb"/>she left the āśrama Rāma was sitting there. At the
<div n="lb"/>same time another thing happened in the āśrama. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma found Sītā coming to him and when he arose to
<div n="lb"/>receive her the figure disappeared. Then Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>found bathing by Sītādevī also disappeared. When an
<div n="lb"/>astonished Sītā reached the āśrama she found an equally
<div n="lb"/>astonished Śrī Rāma sitting there. They then told
<div n="lb"/>each other their experiences and Śrī Rāma on medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion understood that in the guise of Rāma and Sītā Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and Pārvatī had come from Kailāsa to know about
<div n="lb"/>the welfare of the princes in exile.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Pārvatī, Vihuṇḍa and Jalandhara.%} See under those
<div n="lb"/>names.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Pārvatī shines in the court of Brahmā. (Śloka 41,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 11, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) When the Pāṇḍavas were in exile Pārvatī guarded
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna always. (Vana Parva, Chapter 37, Śloka 38).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Pārvatī appeared in person and blessed
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra. (Chapter 6, Virāṭa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa pleased Pārvatī and she granted
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa boons. The first was that he would have sixteen
<div n="lb"/>thousand wives. The next was a beautiful form for
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and the next was love of his relatives. Another
<div n="lb"/>boon was that Kṛṣṇa would have the prosperity to be
<div n="lb"/>able to give food for seven thousand travellers daily.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 7, Chapter 15, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) It was because of a curse of Pārvatī that devas do
<div n="lb"/>not get sons by their own wives. There is the following
<div n="lb"/>story behind that.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva and Pārvatī went to the Himālayas after their
<div n="lb"/>marriage and started living there. Śiva and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>were so much engrossed in their amorous sport that they
<div n="lb"/>were oblivious of the happenings outside. After a long
<div n="lb"/>time when their sport continued without a break the
<div n="lb"/>devas went in and informed Śiva that the whole universe
<div n="lb"/>was trembling by their sport and if Śiva produced a
<div n="lb"/>son the world would be incapable of bearing it and so
<div n="lb"/>he should withdraw from the act of producing a child.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva agreed and drew his virile strength upwards.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī did not like that and she cursed the devas that
<div n="lb"/>they would never have sons of their own wives. (Cha-
<div n="lb"/>pter 84, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Pārvatī once taught Gaṅgādevī the duties of
<div n="lb"/>women. (Śloka 33, Chapter 146, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Pārvatī resides in the mount of Muñjavān in
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa with Paramaśiva. There is a mount called
[Page580-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Muñjavān in the Himālayas. Bhagavān Umāpati (Śiva)
<div n="lb"/>shines there on treetops, underneath the trees, on the
<div n="lb"/>mounts and in caves. (Chapter 8, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) The Mahābhārata uses the following synonyms
<div n="lb"/>for Pārvatī: Ambikā, Āryā, Umā, Bhīmā, Śailaputrī,
<div n="lb"/>Sailarājasutā, Śākambharī, Śarvāṇī, Deveśī, Devī,
<div n="lb"/>Durgā, Gaurī, Girisutā, Girirājātmajā, Kālī, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhīmā, Mahādevī, Mahākālī, Maheśvarī, Parvatarāja-
<div n="lb"/>kanyā, Rudrāṇī, Rudrapatnī and Tribhuvaneśvarī.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Pārvatī pratiṣṭhā.%} The installation of the goddess
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī in temples is done with the following sacred
<div n="lb"/>rites.
<div n="NI"/>An inner temple should be constructed and the idol of
<div n="lb"/>Devī should be installed there. Before that, on the
<div n="lb"/>bed of the platform bearing the idol, amulets with spi-
<div n="lb"/>ritual inscriptions on them should be deposited there
<div n="lb"/>just as in the case of the installation of Maheśvara.
<div n="lb"/>Then Parāśakti should be consecrated there with recit-
<div n="lb"/>als of mantras followed by the deposition of Pañcarat-
<div n="lb"/>nas meditating on Piṇḍikā. Then the idol of Devī
<div n="lb"/>should be fixed on the platform. After that Kriyā-
<div n="lb"/>śakti should be consecrated on the platform and Jñāna-
<div n="lb"/>śakti on the idol. Finally Ambikā named Śivā should
<div n="lb"/>be invoked with the mantras as ordained in the
<div n="lb"/>scriptures.
<div n="NI"/>The different zones like the east and the west and the
<div n="lb"/>guards of the Universe like Indra should also be wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped. (Chapter 98, Agni Purāṇa; Sarga 36, Bāla
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇda, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa; Chapters 51 and 53, Vā-
<div n="lb"/>mana Purāṇa; 7th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata; 4th Skan-
<div n="lb"/>dha, Bhāgavata; Chapter 43, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa; Ara-
<div n="lb"/>ṇya Kāṇḍa, Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa;
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 121, Padma Purāṇa; Chapter 186, Ādi Parva;

<div n="lb"/>Chapter 283, Śānti Parva; Chapters 15, 84, 140 and
<div n="lb"/>146, Anuśāsana Parva; and Chapter 8, Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>PĀRVATĪYA I. (PARVATĪYA). A king who lived
<div n="lb"/>during the period of Mahābhārata. He was born of the
<div n="lb"/>species of the dānava called Kukṣi. (Śloka 56, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>67, Ādi Parva).
