MITRĀVARUṆA¦(S). The combined name of two of
<div n="lb"/>the Dvādaśādityas (twelve Sūryas) Mitra and Varuṇa.
<div n="lb"/>These two are always seen together. Agastya and
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha were born as sons of Mitrāvaruṇa. It was due
<div n="lb"/>to a curse by Mitrāvaruṇas that Urvaśī had to marry
<div n="lb"/>King Purūravas, a man of the earth. Manu had no
<div n="lb"/>children and he performed a yāga to placate Mitrā-
<div n="lb"/>varuṇas. But since there were many faults in the
<div n="lb"/>ceremony a girl was born to him. (For details see under
<div n="lb"/>Ilā, Nimi, Urvaśī, Vasiṣṭha and Mitra).
