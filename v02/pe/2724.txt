IḌĀ I¦. Daughter of Vāyu (wind-god). Iḍā had a son
<div n="lb"/>Utkala by Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>IḌĀ II. Daughter of Manu. In Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>we find the following reference to this Iḍā:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Manu came to know that Devas and Asuras had
<div n="lb"/>performed an Agnyādhāna (consecration of the fire).
<div n="lb"/>To ascertain whether it was deposited at the proper
<div n="lb"/>time, Manu sent Iḍā to them. Iḍā found that both
<div n="lb"/>parties had followed the wrong method, She said to
<div n="lb"/>Manu:—“Your yajña (Agnyādhāna) should not be as
<div n="lb"/>ineffectual as that of the Devas and Asuras. Therefore
<div n="lb"/>I myself shall deposit the Trividhāgnis (the three Agnis
<div n="lb"/>which are to be set in the proper place) at the proper
<div n="lb"/>place.” Manu agreed and began his yāga. As a result
<div n="lb"/>of it the Devas attained plenty and prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Iḍā was in the presence of Manu. the
<div n="lb"/>Devas invited her openly and the Asuras invited her
<div n="lb"/>covertly. Since Iḍā accepted the invitation of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas, all creatures abandoned the Asuras and joined
<div n="lb"/>the party of Devas. (Taittirīya Saṃhitā).
