ṚKṢARAJAS¦. A monkey who was the foster-father of
<div n="lb"/>Bāli and Sugrīva. He was the king of Kiṣkindhā. He
<div n="lb"/>had no issue for a long time. Bāli and Sugrīva were
<div n="lb"/>brought up by Ahalyā at Gautama's āśrama. Ṛksarajas,
<div n="lb"/>with the permission of Indra, went to the āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>took Bāli and Sugrīva with him to Kiṣkindhā. From
<div n="lb"/>that time, Bāli and Sugrīva remained with him as his
<div n="lb"/>foster-sons. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Prakṣipta Sarga,
<div n="lb"/>about the origin of this monkey.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Brahmā was in a state of meditation on the
<div n="lb"/>Meru mountain, tears rolled down from his eyes and
<div n="lb"/>he gathered the tears in his own hands. From those
<div n="lb"/>tears, a monkey came into being. Ṛkṣarajas was that
<div n="lb"/>monkey.
<div n="NI"/>One day, Ṛkṣarajas went to a lake to quench his thirst.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing his own image reflected in the water, he thought
<div n="lb"/>it was some enemy and jumped into the lake, to
<div n="lb"/>attack him. But he soon realized his mistake and
<div n="lb"/>returned to the shore. As soon as he came out of the
<div n="lb"/>water, he felt that he had become a woman. Seeing her
<div n="lb"/>fascinating beauty, Indra and Sūrya were filled with
<div n="lb"/>lustful passion. Both of them had involuntary emission
<div n="lb"/>of semen. Bāli was born from Indra's semen which
<div n="lb"/>fell on the head and Sugrīva was born from Sūrya's
<div n="lb"/>semen which fell on the neck of Ṛkṣarajas. Towards the
<div n="lb"/>end of the night, Ṛkṣarajas lost his female form and re-
<div n="lb"/>gained his former shape as a male. At once he took the
<div n="lb"/>two children with him to Brahmā and told him the
<div n="lb"/>whole story. Brahmā sent a messenger with Ṛkṣarajas
<div n="lb"/>and had him anointed king of Kiṣkindhā. After the
<div n="lb"/>time of Ṛkṣarajas, Bāli became king of Kiṣkindhā.
