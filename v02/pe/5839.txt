RUKMĪ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} King of the Province Bhoja-
<div n="lb"/>kaṭa in the country of Vidarbha. It is stated in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 62, that this
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī was born from a portion of the Asura named
<div n="lb"/>Krodhavaśa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Father of Rukmī was the king Bhīṣmaka.
<div n="lb"/>Two children were born to Bhīṣmaka, named Rukmī
<div n="lb"/>and Rukmiṇī. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>62).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Getting a bow.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa took Rukmī's sister
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī by force and married her. Rukmī did not like
<div n="lb"/>this and so he confronted Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In the contest Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa reviled him. Rukmī got angry at this and went to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa and did penance before Śiva. Śiva appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him after three years, and gave him a bow for
<div n="lb"/>destroying the enemies. Śiva told him that it would be
<div n="lb"/>broken, only if it was used against Mahāviṣṇu. After
<div n="lb"/>getting this bow he returned to Bhojakaṭa and lived
<div n="lb"/>there.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The details regarding Rukmī, given in the Mahābhārata.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Rukmī accepted the suzerainty of Sahadeva at the
<div n="lb"/>time of his regional conquest. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 21, Stanza 62).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Rukmī paid tribute to Karṇa at the time of his
<div n="lb"/>regional conquest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 254,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 14).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The Pāṇḍavas had sent invitation to Rukmī for the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata-battle. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 11,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 16).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Bhīṣmaka, the father of Rukmī, was known
<div n="lb"/>by the name ‘Hiraṇyaromā’ also. Rukmī became
<div n="lb"/>famous throughout all the countries. He accepted
<div n="lb"/>Druma, a famous Kimpuruṣa (Kinnara) as his teacher
<div n="lb"/>in archery. Druma presented him with a bow called
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya. This Vijaya was on a par with the Gāṇḍīva.
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī fought with Śrī Kṛṣṇa and was defeated. The
<div n="lb"/>place at which he was defeated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa is known
<div n="lb"/>as Bhojakaṭa.
<div n="NI"/>After having been defeated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, a thought
<div n="lb"/>arose in the mind of Rukmī to keep amity and concord
<div n="lb"/>with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Knowing this, the Pāṇḍavas invited
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī to their palace. He promised his help if ever
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna feared to do battle. At this Arjuna laughed and
<div n="lb"/>said that he was not in need of any help. After this
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī went to Duryodhana and promised to help him.
<div n="lb"/>But Duryodhana also rejected his help. (M.B. Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 158).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death of Rukmī.%} Discontented with everybody, Rukmī
<div n="lb"/>lived in Bhojakaṭa, having no contact with any body.
<div n="lb"/>During this period the king of Kaliṅga once approached
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī and advised him to challenge Balabhadrarāma
<div n="lb"/>for a game of dice. The challenge was made knowing
<div n="lb"/>that Balabhadra was not a good player. Knowing that
<div n="lb"/>to reject a challenge was not honourable, Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>went to play the game. Rukmī won the first round of
<div n="lb"/>game. Staking everything, the second round of the
<div n="lb"/>game began and Balabhadra won the game. But
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī and the king of Kaliṅga did not accept the
<div n="lb"/>victory. All the kings who witnessed the game sided
<div n="lb"/>with Rukmī. Instantly an ethereal voice said “Balabha-
<div n="lb"/>drarāma has won the game.” The friends of Rukmī
<div n="lb"/>did not accept the ethereal voice. They began to create
<div n="lb"/>a tumult in the hall. Balabhadrarāma who became
<div n="lb"/>furious at this ridicule took a pestle of iron and killed
[Page657-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī with one blow. The rest of the kings fled from
<div n="lb"/>the place. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
