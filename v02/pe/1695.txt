DAMAYANTĪ¦ Daughter of Bhīma the King of Vidar-
<div n="lb"/>bha. The most noble of all the Indian heroines, Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī has secured a place in the literatures of almost
<div n="lb"/>all the languages in the world. The famous hero Nala
<div n="lb"/>is her husband.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The background of the story of Nala.%} During the time
<div n="lb"/>of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas, Arjuna had gone to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa to do penance before Śiva for getting divine
<div n="lb"/>weapons. The rest of the Pāṇḍavas spent the time
<div n="lb"/>till the arrival of Arjuna, in sorrow and sadness. They
<div n="lb"/>spent miserable days one by one. At that time the her-
<div n="lb"/>mit Bṛhadaśva visited them. They welcomed the
<div n="lb"/>hermit. In the midst of their conversation Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra told the hermit with tears that he was the most
<div n="lb"/>unhappy man in the world. Hearing this the hermit
<div n="lb"/>told them the story of Nala, to console the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The birth of Damayantī.%} The King Bhīma of Vidar-
<div n="lb"/>bha was childless for a long time. While the King was
<div n="lb"/>spending sorrowful days, as he had no children, a
<div n="lb"/>hermit named Dama reached his palace. The King
<div n="lb"/>welcomed the hermit. Seeing the sorrow of the King the
<div n="lb"/>hermit blessed the King and the queen, and as a result
<div n="lb"/>a daughter named Damayantī and as her brothers
[Page196-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>three sons Dama, Dānta and Damana were born to
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Damayantī.%} During
<div n="lb"/>this period a son named Nala was born to Vīrasena the
<div n="lb"/>King of Niṣadha. The child was an expert in the game
<div n="lb"/>of dice and he would speak only truth. He grew up
<div n="lb"/>and became a youth.
<div n="NI"/>Once the swans which came to the palace of Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī from Nala, began to praise Nala. They sang
<div n="lb"/>about the glory of Nala. Nala also knew about the
<div n="lb"/>beauty and the other good qualities of Damayantī.
<div n="lb"/>Thus they fell in love with each other. Nala also started
<div n="lb"/>for Kuṇḍinapurī, the capital city of Vidarbha, to marry
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī. The devas (gods) Indra, Agni, Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Yama, having heard of the beauty of Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>from Nārada, had gone Kuṇḍinapurī, to take part
<div n="lb"/>in the marriage. On the way they met Nala. They
<div n="lb"/>were aware of the fact that Damayantī was in love
<div n="lb"/>with Nala. So they called Nala and sent him to Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī with a message that Damayantī should accept
<div n="lb"/>one of the four gods as her husband. By the boon of
<div n="lb"/>invisibility, given by the Gods, Nala entered the room
<div n="lb"/>of Damayantī unseen by others and gave the message
<div n="lb"/>to Damayantī. But Damayantī did not agree to it.
<div n="lb"/>The Gods also entered the nuptial hall and took their
<div n="lb"/>seats in the shape of four Nalas. Damayantī entered
<div n="lb"/>the hall with the nuptial garland in her hands. She
<div n="lb"/>saw five Nalas including the real Nala, and prayed to
<div n="lb"/>the gods to show her the real Nala her lover. So the
<div n="lb"/>devas assumed their real forms and Damayantī put
<div n="lb"/>the garland on the neck of the real Nala and accepted
<div n="lb"/>him as her husband. Being much pleased with the be-
<div n="lb"/>haviour and character of both Nala and Damayantī,
<div n="lb"/>the four gods blessed them. Agni promised to be near
<div n="lb"/>Nala whenever he thought of him. Yama said that
<div n="lb"/>Nala would always be righteous. Varuṇa said that
<div n="lb"/>Nala would obtain water at the thought of it. Indra
<div n="lb"/>blessed him saying that he would get mokṣa immedia-
<div n="lb"/>tely after the completion of a yāga. The gods remained
<div n="lb"/>till the end of the marriage ceremony and then they
<div n="lb"/>departed. Nala and Damayantī lived in Kuṇḍinapurī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The hatred between Kali and Dvāpara.%} Hearing about
<div n="lb"/>the Svayamvara of Damayantī Kali and Dvāpara
<div n="lb"/>started for Kuṇḍinapurī. On the way they met Indra
<div n="lb"/>and the other gods, who were returning from the marri-
<div n="lb"/>age of Damayantī. They told Kali and Dvāpara that
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī had accepted Nala as her husband. Kali
<div n="lb"/>and Dvāpara got angry at this and returned saying
<div n="lb"/>that they would destroy the kingdom of Nala. After
<div n="lb"/>that Kali waited for a chance to enter the body of
<div n="lb"/>Nala. After twelve years, once Nala, after passing
<div n="lb"/>urine, without washing his legs performed his evening
<div n="lb"/>worship. At that moment Kali entered the body of
<div n="lb"/>Nala. With that Nala became bereft of all senses of
<div n="lb"/>righteousness and duty, and challenged his younger
<div n="lb"/>brother Puṣkara to a game of dice. Puṣkara engaged
<div n="lb"/>Nala in the game of dice. Kali stood in the shape of
<div n="lb"/>an ox as helper of Nala. Nala lost his kingdom in the
<div n="lb"/>game. Seeing that her husband was being defeated
<div n="lb"/>continuously, Damayantī sent for the charioteer Vārṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṇeya and sent her son Indrasena and daughter Indra-
<div n="lb"/>senā to Kuṇḍinapurī. After leaving the children at Kuṇḍi-
<div n="lb"/>napurī Vārṣṇeya engaged himself in a travel. After
<div n="lb"/>visiting several countries he reached Ayodhyā and
[Page197-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>became the charioteer of King Ṛtuparṇa.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Nala and Damayantī to the forest.%} Puṣkara got the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom, wealth and everything that his elder brother,
<div n="lb"/>Nala, had possessed. The miserable Nala left every-
<div n="lb"/>thing he had and clad in only one cloth got out of the
<div n="lb"/>palace. His wife Damayantī followed him. They stayed
<div n="lb"/>outside the city for three days. Puṣkara made a pro-
<div n="lb"/>clamation that if anybody rendered any help to Nala
<div n="lb"/>he would be ruthlessly put to death. After that Nala stay-
<div n="lb"/>ed there for three more days, with only water for food
<div n="lb"/>and drink. Then he went to the forest. His wife followed
<div n="lb"/>him. They were hungry. Nala saw some golden birds.
<div n="lb"/>Nala wanted to catch them for food. So he took his
<div n="lb"/>only cloth and spread it on the ground. The birds
<div n="lb"/>took that cloth and flew away. Those birds were the
<div n="lb"/>dices used in the game. They were influenced by
<div n="lb"/>Kali. The miserable and hungerstricken Nala asked
<div n="lb"/>his wife Damayantī to go with the caravan traders
<div n="lb"/>who were going to Avanti and save herself. But she
<div n="lb"/>did not consent to go away from him.
<div n="NI"/>They spent that night in an inn. They both fell asleep
<div n="lb"/>because of weakness. After a time Nala woke up.
<div n="lb"/>He thought that his wife would somehow or other
<div n="lb"/>get to some country closeby and save herself, if he
<div n="lb"/>left her there. So he decided to take half of her cloth.
<div n="lb"/>How to do it without her knowledge? Thinking so he
<div n="lb"/>walked round the inn. He saw a good sword. He
<div n="lb"/>took the sword, and cut half of the cloth of Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>and leaving her in the inn he went away.
<div n="NI"/>In a short while she woke up and missing her husband
<div n="lb"/>she cried aloud and ran here and there in search of
<div n="lb"/>him. Then she went into the forest crying. A big snake
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of her and began to swallow her. She cried
<div n="lb"/>aloud. Hearing the cry, a forester came there. He
<div n="lb"/>cut the snake open and saved Damayantī. But when
<div n="lb"/>he saw her he became overpowered by libido and
<div n="lb"/>tried to make her his wife. She got angry and cursed
<div n="lb"/>him and he instantly fell down dead. After this she
<div n="lb"/>began to wander in the forest aimlessly, often seeing
<div n="lb"/>wild animals and fearing them. At last she got on a
<div n="lb"/>rock and sat there and began to wail thinking of Nala.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Damayantī in the kingdom of Cedi.%} While she was
<div n="lb"/>sitting on the rock wailing, a caravan of traders came
<div n="lb"/>by that way. They had been attacked by a herd of
<div n="lb"/>elephants and were running away from them. They
<div n="lb"/>saw Damayantī. She told them her story. They brought
<div n="lb"/>her to the kingdom of Cedi. She wandered through
<div n="lb"/>the country for a while and finally reached the palace
<div n="lb"/>of the King Subāhu. Thinking her to be a mad wo-
<div n="lb"/>man the street boys were following her. The queen
<div n="lb"/>saw the woman surrounded by street boys and felt
<div n="lb"/>pity for her. She sent her maid and brought her to
<div n="lb"/>the palace. Without revealing that she was the queen
<div n="lb"/>of King Nala, she told everything else to the queen.
<div n="lb"/>The queen consoled her and said that she would get her
<div n="lb"/>husband back. She invited Damayantī to stay in the
<div n="lb"/>palace till she got her husband back. Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>replied as follows: “Mother, I shall stay here. But
<div n="lb"/>there are certain conditions. I won't eat remains and
<div n="lb"/>offals of victuals, I won't make others to wash my legs.
<div n="lb"/>I won't talk with men who are not related to me. If
<div n="lb"/>anybody hankers after me you must order him to be
<div n="lb"/>killed. Brāhmaṇas may come and see me only in con-
<div n="lb"/>nection with the search for my husband. This is my
<div n="lb"/>vow.” The queen agreed to her conditions and made
[Page197-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>her the attendant of her daughter Sunandā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Nala in Ayodhyā.%} Nala filled with sorrow was walk-
<div n="lb"/>ing along the forest when he saw a wild fire. From the
<div n="lb"/>midst of the fire somebody was calling Nala by name
<div n="lb"/>and crying. When Nala approached the fire, he saw
<div n="lb"/>the great and famous serpent Karkoṭaka lying entwined
<div n="lb"/>in the flames. Karkoṭaka the King of the Nāgas had
<div n="lb"/>once deceived Nārada, who then cursed him that he
<div n="lb"/>would become stationary in a place like an immovable
<div n="lb"/>thing till Nala came and rescued him. From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards, Karkoṭaka was remaining in that forest with-
<div n="lb"/>out moving. Then the forest caught fire. Karkoṭaka
<div n="lb"/>being unable to move had to remain in the fire. Nala
<div n="lb"/>immediately saved Karkoṭaka from the fire and with
<div n="lb"/>that he was absolved from the curse of Nārada. Kar-
<div n="lb"/>koṭaka asked Nala to walk forward, counting the steps.
<div n="lb"/>When Nala counted ten, Karkoṭaka bit on the leg of
<div n="lb"/>Nala and he became ugly. Then the serpent said to
<div n="lb"/>the flurried Nala, “Don't fear. I have made you ugly
<div n="lb"/>so that others may not recognize you. Now you are
<div n="lb"/>ugly because of my poison. But my poison has affected
<div n="lb"/>Kali who is in your body. Because he had harmed
<div n="lb"/>you who are blameless, he has to suffer for it. So long
<div n="lb"/>as this poison is in you, nobody will harm you. You
<div n="lb"/>must go to Ṛtuparṇa the King of Ayodhyā and tell
<div n="lb"/>him that you are Bāhuka a charioteer. You must give
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtuparṇa the spell ‘Aśvahṛdaya mantra’ and get
<div n="lb"/>from him the spell ‘Akṣahṛdayamantra’. After that
<div n="lb"/>you will have reunion with your wife and children.
<div n="lb"/>Here are two cloths for you. Whenever you want
<div n="lb"/>to get your original form you need only wear them.”
<div n="lb"/>Saying these words Karkoṭaka gave Nala two divine
<div n="lb"/>garments and then disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>Nala started for Ayodhyā. He reached the palace
<div n="lb"/>on the tenth day. There he was employed as the horse
<div n="lb"/>keeper of Ṛtuparṇa on a pay of hundred pieces of gold.
<div n="lb"/>Thus he stayed there under the name Bāhuka. Vārṣṇeya
<div n="lb"/>and Jīvala who were the horse-keepers of Ṛtuparṇa
<div n="lb"/>upto that time, were placed under Bāhuka.
<div n="NI"/>Bāhuka used to recite a poem every evening when he
<div n="lb"/>returned from his work.
<Poem>Weary and worn of hunger and thirst,
<div n="lb"/>That poor woman, where might she be?
<div n="lb"/>Serving whom will she be now.
<div n="lb"/>Thinking of the unlucky fool?</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this song of lamentation everyday, once his
<div n="lb"/>assistant Jīvala asked Bāhuka, whom he was reciting
<div n="lb"/>the poem about. Bāhuka replied: “Once there was
<div n="lb"/>a man who was a fool. He got a good wife. For some
<div n="lb"/>reason they were separated. The fool is still wandering
<div n="lb"/>about weary and sad in search of his wife.”
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Damayantī in Kuṇḍinapura.%} At this time Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī was living in the palace of the King of Cedi,
<div n="lb"/>as the maid of princess Sunandā. King Bhīma became
<div n="lb"/>very sorry not knowing where Nala and Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>had gone. He sent men in all directions to search for
<div n="lb"/>them. The King proclaimed that those who found
<div n="lb"/>them would be awarded thousand cows, lands assigned
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmins, and villages. He proclaimed that so
<div n="lb"/>many cows would be given even to those who could
<div n="lb"/>give any information about them. Hearing this Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas went in all directions and Sudeva, one of them,
<div n="lb"/>reached the Kingdom of Cedi. He recognized Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī who was like fire inside the cover of smoke. When
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī was alone Sudeva approached her and
[Page198-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>said that he had come from Vidarbha and that he was
<div n="lb"/>a friend of Damayantī's brother. Damayantī recog-
<div n="lb"/>nized Sudeva and she cried aloud. Sunandā who saw
<div n="lb"/>this scene, told her mother about it. The queen sent
<div n="lb"/>for Sudeva and asked him what the matter was. He
<div n="lb"/>revealed everything about Damayantī, to the queen.
<div n="lb"/>When they heard the story all the women in the harem
<div n="lb"/>cried. Then with tears the queen said, “Hear this,
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī, your mother and myself are the two daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ters of Sudama the King of Daśārṇa. Father gave
<div n="lb"/>your mother to Bhīma the King of Vidarbha and me
<div n="lb"/>to Vīrabāhu the King of Cedi. I have seen you when
<div n="lb"/>you were an infant.”
<div n="NI"/>When the King of Cedi knew everything he sent Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī in a palanquin to Vidarbha.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The search for Nala.%} Damayantī told her father
<div n="lb"/>that she didn't want to live any longer unless Nala
<div n="lb"/>was brought to her. Bhīma had been trying hard to
<div n="lb"/>find out Nala. One day Parṇāda one of the numerous
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins who were engaged in the search for Nala,
<div n="lb"/>came to Bhīma and said, “while I was wandering from
<div n="lb"/>place to place, I happened to reach the palace of Ṛtu-
<div n="lb"/>parṇa the King of Ayodhyā. There I made enquiries
<div n="lb"/>about Nala the husband of Damayantī, in the pre-
<div n="lb"/>sence of the King. But nobody gave me any answer.
<div n="lb"/>When I returned Bāhuka the charioteer of Ṛtuparṇa
<div n="lb"/>followed me. An ugly man with short hands, an ex-
<div n="lb"/>pert in driving horses, and an excellent cook, he asked
<div n="lb"/>me several questions about Damayantī.”
<div n="NI"/>When Damayantī heard this she had horripilation.
<div n="lb"/>She secretly went to her mother and compelled her
<div n="lb"/>to send Sudeva the Brāhmaṇa to Ayodhyā. Her mother
<div n="lb"/>consented. She called Sudeva, in the presence of her
<div n="lb"/>mother and told him to go to Ayodhyā and tell Ṛtuparṇa
<div n="lb"/>that the second svayaṃvara (marriage) of Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>would take place before sunrise next day and that
<div n="lb"/>he should come earlier. Sudeva instantly went to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtuparṇa, hearing the words of Sudeva, wanted
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuka to take him in the chariot to Vidarbha within
<div n="lb"/>the period of a day time for the second svayaṃvara
<div n="lb"/>of Damayantī. Nala consented with a breaking heart.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately they started. Vārṣṇeya also got into
<div n="lb"/>the chariot. The chariot flew through the sky with
<div n="lb"/>tremendous speed, to Vidarbha. On the way the upper
<div n="lb"/>garment of the King fell on the ground. He ordered
<div n="lb"/>the chariot to be stopped for taking his upper garment.
<div n="lb"/>Nala said that within that winking time the chariot
<div n="lb"/>had travelled a yojana (league) and gloried in his
<div n="lb"/>power of driving horses. Then they saw in the forest
<div n="lb"/>a Tanni tree (Terminalia bellerica) with fruits. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>the Tanni tree the King said, “O Bāhuka, if you are
<div n="lb"/>an expert in horse-driving I am an expert in reckoning.
<div n="lb"/>I will tell you how many leaves and nuts there are
<div n="lb"/>in that Tanni Tree. There are five crores of leaves in
<div n="lb"/>both the branches together and two thousand and
<div n="lb"/>ninety-five nuts. They stopped the chariot and checked
<div n="lb"/>the tree and found the reckoning of the King correct.
<div n="lb"/>The King had the knowledge of the art called ‘Akṣahṛ-
<div n="lb"/>daya’. It was with this art that the king calculated
<div n="lb"/>the number of leaves in the tree, at one look. Bāhuka
<div n="lb"/>drove the chariot with the speed of wind because he had
<div n="lb"/>known the art called ‘Aśvahṛdaya’. Then and there,
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuka taught the King the art of ‘Aśvahṛdaya’ and
<div n="lb"/>the King taught Bāhuka the art of ‘Akṣahṛdaya’. The
[Page198-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>moment Nala learned Akṣahṛdaya Kali vomitted
<div n="lb"/>the poison of Karkoṭaka and got out of the body of
<div n="lb"/>Nala. Long ago, the mother of Indrasena, a god, had
<div n="lb"/>cursed Kali and drove him out. Since then Kali had
<div n="lb"/>been living in the body of Nala. As soon as he came
<div n="lb"/>out Kali begged Nala for pardon. Nala curbed his
<div n="lb"/>anger. But Kali was afraid of Nala. So he made the
<div n="lb"/>Tanni tree his abode. Because of that Tanni became
<div n="lb"/>detestable.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtuparṇa, Vārṣṇeya and Bāhuka reached Kuṇḍina-
<div n="lb"/>pura in the evening. When the sound of the chariot
<div n="lb"/>of Nala reached the ears of Damayantī her heart bumped
<div n="lb"/>with joy. The chariot was stopped and Ṛtuparṇa
<div n="lb"/>entered the palace. The King Bhīma welcomed
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtuparṇa heartily. As there was no sign of any prepara-
<div n="lb"/>tion for the svayaṃvara (marriage) Ṛtuparṇa under-
<div n="lb"/>stood that some sort of trick had been played on him.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Test of Nala.%} Damayantī sent her maid Keśinī
<div n="lb"/>to Bāhuka to watch him. Keśinī had a secret talk
<div n="lb"/>with Bāhuka. Though Nala did not reveal himself,
<div n="lb"/>he cried when she talked about Damayantī. Keśinī
<div n="lb"/>returned to Damayantī and told her what she had
<div n="lb"/>heard and seen. Damayantī became more and more
<div n="lb"/>convinced that Bāhuka was Nala himself So she sent
<div n="lb"/>Keśinī again to Nala. She discovered the following
<div n="lb"/>facts about Bāhuka, after a keen observation, and
<div n="lb"/>made a report of them.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Bāhuka does not stop to pass through even a small
<div n="lb"/>door. The upper sill lifts by itself for him to pass
<div n="lb"/>through.
<div n="NI"/>(2) He gets enough room for him to pass through even
<div n="lb"/>a big crowd.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Empty pots are filled with water at a look from him.
<div n="NI"/>(4) When he stretches out a grass to the sun, it catches
<div n="lb"/>fire.
<div n="NI"/>(5) Fire does not burn him even if he touches it.
<div n="NI"/>(6) When he crushes a flower, it blooms more beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful and fragrant than before.
<div n="NI"/>When Keśinī said all these facts to Damayantī, she
<div n="lb"/>became fully convinced that Bāhuka was none other
<div n="lb"/>than Nala himself. Damayantī sent Keśinī again to
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuka to get some meat cooked by him. Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>tested the taste of the meat brought by Keśinī and
<div n="lb"/>she knew that the food was cooked by Nala. She
<div n="lb"/>sent Keśinī again to Bāhuka with her children. See-
<div n="lb"/>ing Indrasena and Indrasenā coming to him, Bāhuka
<div n="lb"/>ran to them, gathered them and embraced them and
<div n="lb"/>cried aloud. Then he told Keśinī that he had done
<div n="lb"/>so because the children were just like his two child-
<div n="lb"/>ren.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Reunion.%} After having tested Bāhuka so far Dama-
<div n="lb"/>yantī sent Keśinī to her mother to tell her everything,
<div n="lb"/>and to say that she was convinced of the fact that
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuka was none other than Nala and that the diffe-
<div n="lb"/>rence was only in shape and to request that she may
<div n="lb"/>be permitted to see Bāhuka in person. The queen
<div n="lb"/>informed the King of all these facts. With the permis-
<div n="lb"/>sion of her parents Bāhuka was brought to the room
<div n="lb"/>of Damayantī. The moment Bāhuka saw Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>he began to shed tears. Damayantī also was filled
<div n="lb"/>with emotion. But she told him thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“Bāhuka, have you seen a man who had left his sleep-
<div n="lb"/>ing wife in the forest? Who else, but Nala the famous
<div n="lb"/>and the righteous would discard his blameless and
<div n="lb"/>loving wife who had been sleeping, with fatigue and
[Page199-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>hunger in a lonely place? Have I done anything
<div n="lb"/>wrong to him in my younger days so that he should
<div n="lb"/>leave me in the forest when I was sleeping? Leaving
<div n="lb"/>aside real gods I married him. I worshipped, him. I had
<div n="lb"/>children from his blood and now he has abandoned
<div n="lb"/>me. In the presence of Gods and with fire as witness,
<div n="lb"/>holding my hands he had taken a vow that he would
<div n="lb"/>support and protect me. Where has that vow gone?”
<div n="lb"/>At these words Bāhuka shed tears for a long time.
<div n="lb"/>Then he told her all that had happened to him since
<div n="lb"/>their separation. Damayantī requested Nala, not to
<div n="lb"/>have any misconception regarding the idea of a second
<div n="lb"/>svayaṃvara; she said to him that she committed no
<div n="lb"/>wrong and that her fidelity and loyalty had undergone
<div n="lb"/>no change. At that time Vāyu (the wind-god) in an
<div n="lb"/>etherial voice said “Damayantī has committed no
<div n="lb"/>sin”. Immediately Nala put on the divine clothes
<div n="lb"/>given by Karkoṭaka and regained his original form.
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī embraced Nala and cried aloud. The king
<div n="lb"/>her father, mother and the people of the city all ran
<div n="lb"/>to them.
<div n="NI"/>Next day Ṛtuparṇa returned. After a few days Nala
<div n="lb"/>collected an army consisting of three hundred soldiers,
<div n="lb"/>sixteen elephants, fifty horses and a white chariot only,
<div n="lb"/>from Vidarbha and went to the kingdom of Niṣadha.
<div n="lb"/>Reaching there Nala challenged Puṣkara for a game of
<div n="lb"/>dice. Puṣkara refused the challenge. Nala took his
<div n="lb"/>sword to cut Puṣkara into two. Finally Puṣkara agreed
<div n="lb"/>to play. At the first cast of the dice the life and the
<div n="lb"/>Kingdom of Puṣkara fell into the hands of Nala. But
<div n="lb"/>Nala did not kill Puṣkara; instead, he embraced him.
<div n="lb"/>Nala became King. Damayantī and the children reached
<div n="lb"/>Niṣadha. Nala ruled the country with more happiness
<div n="lb"/>and prosperity than before. (Mahābhārata, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 52 to 79).
