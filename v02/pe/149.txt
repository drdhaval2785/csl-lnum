AKṢAHṚDAYA¦. A sacred chant or mantra. When
<div n="lb"/>Nala was roaming about in the forests after his separa-
<div n="lb"/>tion from Damayantī he happened to save the cobra,
<div n="lb"/>Kārkoṭaka, from a wild fire. But in return the snake bit
<div n="lb"/>him and made him as black as clouds. He then advised
<div n="lb"/>Nala to go to the palace of King Ṛtuparṇa where the
[Page023-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>cobra said, Nala would be taught the secret mantra of
<div n="lb"/>Akṣahṛdaya by the King.
<div n="NI"/>One who knows this sacred chant can find out all secrets
<div n="lb"/>of a game of dice and can count within no time the
<div n="lb"/>number of leaves, fruits and flowers on a tree. Nala went
<div n="lb"/>to Rṭuparṇa and stayed with him. While living there a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin named Sudeva came to Ṛtuparṇa and informed
<div n="lb"/>him that Damayantī was going to marry again. Ṛtuparṇa
<div n="lb"/>immediately started for Vidarbha taking Nala as his
<div n="lb"/>charioteer. The chariot driven by Nala flew like a wind
<div n="lb"/>and on the way when Ṛtuparṇa's handkerchief fell down
<div n="lb"/>and he requested Nala to stop the chariot. Nala informed
<div n="lb"/>him that by the time the request was made they had
<div n="lb"/>travelled already one yojana. As they proceeded they
<div n="lb"/>saw a huge tree full of leaves and fruits. Ṛtuparṇa at a
<div n="lb"/>glance told Nala that the tree contained five crores of
<div n="lb"/>leaves and two thousand nine hunḍred and five fruits.
<div n="lb"/>Nala was surprised. Then they understood that Nala
<div n="lb"/>was able to drive the chariot so quickly because of his
<div n="lb"/>knowledge of the sacred chant Aśvahṛdaya and that
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtuparṇa was able to count the leaves and fruits be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of his knowledge of the chant Akṣahṛdaya. They
<div n="lb"/>taught each other the sacred mantras. Because of this
<div n="lb"/>Akṣahṛdaya Nala was able to win the game of dice the
<div n="lb"/>second time and regain his kingdom. (Chapter 72,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva).
