MITHI¦ (MITHI JANAKA). Son of King Nimi. The
<div n="lb"/>sixth chapter of Devī Bhāgavata gives the following
<div n="lb"/>story about the birth of Mithi.
[Page503-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>There was once an emperor of great renown in the line
<div n="lb"/>of Ikṣvāku named Nimi. He was the twelfth son of the
<div n="lb"/>celebrated Ikṣvāku and was devoted to the welfare of
<div n="lb"/>his subjects. He was a very honest, virtuous, righteous
<div n="lb"/>and good-natured man of a charitable disposition. The
<div n="lb"/>agrahāra (village where brahmins reside) named
<div n="lb"/>Jayantapura near the āśrama of Gautama Maharṣi was
<div n="lb"/>constructed by this emperor. This emperor of a Rājaṣic
<div n="lb"/>mind decided to perform a yāga which would take
<div n="lb"/>years for its conclusion and in which land was to be
<div n="lb"/>given as gifts. He went to his father Ikṣvāku, and took
<div n="lb"/>permission from him to conduct the yāga. He made all
<div n="lb"/>preparations for the yāga. He invited Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras,
<div n="lb"/>Vāmadeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and Ṛcīka all of whom
<div n="lb"/>were well-versed in the Vedas and were worthy of being
<div n="lb"/>priests in a Yāga of the kind he was conducting. He
<div n="lb"/>then went and invited his Kulaguru (family priest and
<div n="lb"/>preceptor) Vasiṣṭha for the Yāga. But Vasiṣṭha had to
<div n="lb"/>officiate at a Yāga conducted by Indra and so he
<div n="lb"/>commanded Nimi to postpone the Yāga by five hundred
<div n="lb"/>years. Nimi did not act according to it and he perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed the Yāga with the help of the other sages and com-
<div n="lb"/>pleted it successfully. After five hundred years when
<div n="lb"/>the Yāga of Indra came to a close, Vasiṣṭha came to see
<div n="lb"/>Nimi. Nimi was asleep then and the servants in the
<div n="lb"/>palace hesitated to go and inform him of the arrival of
<div n="lb"/>the sage. Vasiṣṭha got angry and cursed him and made
<div n="lb"/>him Videha (without body). At once the body of the
<div n="lb"/>King fell to the ground and the soul got out of it. But
<div n="lb"/>before the soul separated from the body Nimi cursed
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha also and separated his soul from his body.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha was again born as the son of Mitrāvaruṇas.
<div n="NI"/>The other sages present there took the lifeless body of
<div n="lb"/>Nimi and after sacrificial ceremonies and worship of
<div n="lb"/>gods started to churn the body. After some time a mighty
<div n="lb"/>and perfect man of great brilliance was born out of it.
<div n="lb"/>Because he was born by Mathana (churning) he was
<div n="lb"/>named Mithi. Because he was born from his father
<div n="lb"/>(Janaka) he was called Mithijanaka and because he was
<div n="lb"/>born of Nimi, a Videha, he was called Videha also.
<div n="lb"/>The country which was ruled by Mithi got the name
<div n="lb"/>of Mithilā. It is the country of Sītā.
