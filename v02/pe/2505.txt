GRĀMADEVATĀ¦. India is predominantly a rural
<div n="lb"/>country with a number of villages, and the rural folk
<div n="lb"/>depend mainly upon agriculture for living. Agricultural
<div n="lb"/>land, rain and epidemics which affect them as well as
<div n="lb"/>their cattle—these are the main concern of the villagers.
<div n="lb"/>Indians, from very ancient days, used to believe that
<div n="lb"/>each of the above has its own presiding devatās. Such
<div n="lb"/>devatās are the grāmadevatās.
<div n="NI"/>Devī is the chief grāmadevatā of South India. Devī is
<div n="lb"/>called Durgā and Kālī also. But, Devī is worshipped in
<div n="lb"/>sixtyfour different forms or aspects. The gentle Devī,
<div n="lb"/>viz. in her gentle aspect or attitude has three forms,
<div n="lb"/>Kanyā, Kāmākṣī, and Mūkāmbikā. In Kerala Devī is
<div n="lb"/>called Bhagavatī also. Valiyaṅgāḍi Bhagavatī of
<div n="lb"/>Calicut is Lakṣmīdevī. Kālī temples in Karṇāṭaka are
<div n="lb"/>called ‘Koṭṭāpuraṃ Lakṣmī Kṣetras’. There are such
[Page299-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>temples in Andhra also. Most of them are Jokulāmbikā
<div n="lb"/>temples. In Tamil Nadu there are grāmadevatās called
<div n="lb"/>Mariyamma, Kālīyamma, and Draupadīyamma. Not
<div n="lb"/>the Draupadī mentioned in the Mahābhārata; but the
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇṇakī of Cilappadikāra is the Devī worshipped in
<div n="lb"/>Tamil Nadu.
<div n="NI"/>There are two kinds of Devīs called Saptamātṛs and
<div n="lb"/>Saptakanyās. Saptamātṛs have puruṣas (husbands) and
<div n="lb"/>saptakanyās have seven brothers for help and support.
<div n="lb"/>Devī pūjā is very much prevalent in South India. The
<div n="lb"/>custom is supposed to be as old as 5000 B.C. Idols of
<div n="lb"/>Devī have been unearthed from Mohanjo-daro and
<div n="lb"/>Harappa. Even the Buddhists worship the Devīs called
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣī and Hārītī. When in after years Hinduism was
<div n="lb"/>revitalised these grāmadevatās got promoted as the
<div n="lb"/>great Devatās of the epics and the Purāṇas. The
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa mentions the incident of the Devī called
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkālakṣmī driving away Hanūmān. There are famous
<div n="lb"/>Kālī temples in Ujjayinī and Calcutta. It is believed
<div n="lb"/>that in the temple at Cidambaram also Kālī occupied
<div n="lb"/>a prominent place. But, according to legends, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>defeated Kālī in a dance competition and ousted her to
<div n="lb"/>her present temple at the outskirts of the city. Cāmuṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>is worshipped as the ancestral guardian deity in Mysore.
<div n="lb"/>The Kāmākṣī temple of Kāñcī, Mīnākṣī temple of
<div n="lb"/>Madura and Mūkāmbikā temple of North Karṇāṭaka
<div n="lb"/>may be cited as examples for the worship of the gentle
<div n="lb"/>form of Devī. Alarmel Maṅkattāyār temple at
<div n="lb"/>Tiruccānūr is a very important Devī temple. The
<div n="lb"/>‘Aditi’ in the Vedas and Koṭṭravai of Tamil Saṅgha
<div n="lb"/>texts point to the very long past of the Devī in India.
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa and Kālamegha (a Tamil poet of the
<div n="lb"/>fifteenth century have worshipped Kālī. Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>Paramahaṃsa and the great modern Tamil poet
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratī were devotees of Kālī.
<div n="NI"/>There are also grāmadevas worshipped like the grāma-
<div n="lb"/>devatās. Munīśvara and Karuppan are two prominent
<div n="lb"/>grāmadevas. In certain villages Bhairava, Vīra Irula,
<div n="lb"/>Kāṭṭeri and Noṅgi are worshipped as grāmadevas. In
<div n="lb"/>South Karṇāṭaka a set of Devas called Bhūtas are
<div n="lb"/>worshipped, Pañcuruli being one of them. Śāstā or
<div n="lb"/>Ayyappa is another grāmadeva. Śāstā is most popular
<div n="lb"/>in Kerala and in Tamil Nāḍu. Buddha also is called
<div n="lb"/>Śāstā. In certain places idols of Śāstā with two wives,
<div n="lb"/>called Pūrṇā and Puṣkalā are also found. Śabarimala
<div n="lb"/>Śāstā is yogamūrti (in yogic pose).
<div n="NI"/>In most of the grāmadeva temples idols of the Devas
<div n="lb"/>are not found. A pīṭha (stool-like seat) is supposed as
<div n="lb"/>the seat of the Deva and it represents the Deva also.
<div n="lb"/>But, in some temples weapons like the sword, the club
<div n="lb"/>etc. are found. Offerings to the deity in grāmakṣetras
<div n="lb"/>and annual festivals are common in such temples. (Nām
<div n="lb"/>vaṇamguṃ daivaṃgal-Tamil).
