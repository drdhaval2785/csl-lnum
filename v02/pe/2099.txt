DIVYAVARṢA¦(M). 365 days make one year for hu-
<div n="lb"/>man beings. One year for human beings is one day for
<div n="lb"/>the gods. 365 such days of the gods make one year for
<div n="lb"/>the gods. This means that 365 years for human beings
<div n="lb"/>are equal to one year for the gods. The year for the
<div n="lb"/>gods is known as “Divyavarsa” or “Divyavatsara”.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtayuga is made up of 4,800 Divyavatsaras. Tretāyu-
<div n="lb"/>uga has 3,600 Divyavatsaras. 2,400 Divyavatsaras make
<div n="lb"/>up one Dvāparayuga. Kaliyuga has 1,200 Divyavatsaras.
<div n="lb"/>12,000 Divyavarṣas of this kind make up one “catur-
<div n="lb"/>yuga”. 71 Caturyugas are the period of one Manu.
<div n="lb"/>After the end of the period of one Manu, the gods
<div n="lb"/>complete their term of existence. The total period of
<div n="lb"/>14 Manus is called a Kalpa. At the end of every
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa there is a deluge. One Kalpa is one day time
<div n="lb"/>for Brahmā. After the deluge, until the time of one
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa, is Brahmā's night. There is no universe at that
<div n="lb"/>time. At the end of that Kalpa, the next Kalpa
<div n="lb"/>begins and Brahmā starts his work of creation.
<div n="lb"/>In this way when 360 days and nights of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>are completed, it is one Brahmā Varṣa. One Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>life-span is 120 such years. After that there is nothing
[Page246-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>for a Brahmā's life-span. Then Brahmā is re-born and
<div n="lb"/>resumes creation. (Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha).
