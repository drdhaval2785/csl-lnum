LAKṢMAṆA¦. Son born to Daśaratha of Sumitrā.
<div n="lb"/>1) {%Short history.%} Since details about Lakṣmaṇa are
<div n="lb"/>included in the story under ‘Rāma’ only a short
<div n="lb"/>description is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Daśaratha, King of Ayodhyā had three wives,
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā, Kaikeyī and Sumitrā. To obtain children
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha performed a sacrifice named Putrakāmeṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>requesting the great sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to officiate at the
<div n="lb"/>ceremony. At the close of the ceremony a divine
<div n="lb"/>person rose up from the sacrificial fire with a pot of
<div n="lb"/>pudding and all the three wives became pregnant by
<div n="lb"/>eating the same. Kausalyā gave birth to Śrī Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī to Bharata and Sumitrā to Lakṣmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna. Lakṣmaṇa was an incarnation of Ananta
<div n="lb"/>and so Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa had more attachment to
<div n="lb"/>each other.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra once took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to the
<div n="lb"/>forests to give protection to the sages against the
<div n="lb"/>demons who gave them trouble. In the course of that
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra took them to the Svayaṃvara held at the
<div n="lb"/>court of Janaka and Śrī Rāma married Sītā and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa married Ūrmilā.
[Page449-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>When the coronation of Śrī Rāma was about to take
<div n="lb"/>place, Kaikeyī demanded of Daśaratha, on the strength
<div n="lb"/>of the two boons granted to her on a previous occasion,
<div n="lb"/>to send Śrī Rāma to the forests for fourteen years and
<div n="lb"/>crown Bharata her son as King. Daśaratha was
<div n="lb"/>compelled to accede to her request and so Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>went to the forests. Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa accompanied
<div n="lb"/>him. Lakṣmaṇa during the fourteen years of their
<div n="lb"/>exile followed his brother Rāma like a shadow.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa cut off the breasts and nose of Śūrpaṇakhā,
<div n="lb"/>the demoness who made amorous overtures to them.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa acted promptly and bravely when the
<div n="lb"/>notorious trio, Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras attacked
<div n="lb"/>them and he was responsible for the slaughter of the
<div n="lb"/>three. Rāvaṇa, coming to know of that, carried away
<div n="lb"/>Sītā to Laṅkā.
<div n="NI"/>Grief-stricken, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa roamed about in
<div n="lb"/>the forests searching for Sītā. At last they came to
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva with whom they made an alliance. Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa got back for Sugrīva his kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā and Sugrīva in return helped Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa to fight Rāvaṇa. Accompanied by an army
<div n="lb"/>led by Sugrīva Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went to Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>and defeating Rāvaṇa took back Sītā to Ayodhyā. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma was crowned King and Lakṣmaṇa helped his
<div n="lb"/>brother in his duties. When there arose a scandal
<div n="lb"/>about Sītā from the people, Śrī Rāma asked Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>to take Sītā away to the forest and leave her there. In
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvamedha conducted by Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>led the sacrificial horse and the horse was blocked and
<div n="lb"/>captured by Lava and Kuśa and Lakṣmaṇa fought
<div n="lb"/>against them.
<div n="NI"/>When the purpose of the incarnation of Rāma was
<div n="lb"/>over, god of Death in the garb of a sage approached
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma for a private talk. Rāma and the sage were
<div n="lb"/>closeted in a room and Lakṣmaṇa was asked to keep
<div n="lb"/>watch over the door with instructions not to allow
<div n="lb"/>anybody inside. After some time sage Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>came there and Lakṣmaṇa entered the room to give
<div n="lb"/>his brother the information of his arrival. Rāma was
<div n="lb"/>angry and abandoned Lakṣmaṇa and, feeling repen-
<div n="lb"/>tant later, Śrī Rāma jumped into the river and drowned
<div n="lb"/>himself before a huge crowd of weeping subjects.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa immediately ended his life by drowning
<div n="lb"/>himself at the same place where his brother did so.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Lakṣmaṇa was born on the day of Āśleṣā
<div n="lb"/>in the lagna of Karkaṭaka. (Śloka 15, Chapter 18,
<div n="lb"/>Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
