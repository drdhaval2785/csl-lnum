KARṆA I¦. The eldest son of Kuntī. Though he was the
<div n="lb"/>brother of the Pāṇḍavas he joined sides with the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas and became the King of Aṅga. So the name of
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa comes in the genealogy of the Aṅga royal family.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Karṇa.%} Pāṇḍu, a King of Candravaṃśa,
<div n="lb"/>married Kuntī, daughter of King Śūrasena. This girl
<div n="lb"/>was brought up even from childhood by a King called
<div n="lb"/>Kuntibhoja. She grew up in the palace of the King. She
<div n="lb"/>was once put in charge of attending to the welfare of
<div n="lb"/>those engaged in religious duties. The sage Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>came there then and stayed for four months as the king's
<div n="lb"/>guest. Kuntī served the sage during his stay there with
<div n="lb"/>so much care, patience and devotion that the sage was
<div n="lb"/>immensely pleased and gave her at the time of his de-
<div n="lb"/>parture a divine mantra. If she called upon any god
<div n="lb"/>repeating that mantra once, that god would manifest
<div n="lb"/>himself to her and bless her with a son equal to him
[Page391-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>in glory. The mantra was to be used only five times.
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī was young and wanted to test the power of the
<div n="lb"/>mantra. So she recited the mantra meditating on the
<div n="lb"/>Sun. Instantly she felt she saw a divine person coming
<div n="lb"/>to her from the sun. She was perplexed. But the
<div n="lb"/>divine form embraced her and consoled her saying that
<div n="lb"/>she would never lose her virginity even if she bore a
<div n="lb"/>son from him. None excepting her step-mother knew
<div n="lb"/>about this. In due course Kuntī delivered a male child
<div n="lb"/>and with the help of her step-mother she put that child
<div n="lb"/>in a box and floated it on the river Aśvā.
<div n="NI"/>That box leaving the river Aśvā entered the Yamunā
<div n="lb"/>river and leaving Yamunā it entered the river Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>Drifting slowly the box reached Campāpurī, a country
<div n="lb"/>of Sūtas. Adhiratha born of the Sūtavaṃśa and an ally
<div n="lb"/>of the Kauravas, saw a box floating on the river while
<div n="lb"/>he went for his bath and took it home. Rādhā, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Adhiratha, who was childless was greatly pleased to see
<div n="lb"/>a babe inside the box and they adopted it and brought
<div n="lb"/>it up. The boy was named Vasuṣeṇa. It was this babe
<div n="lb"/>that became the celebrated Karṇa afterwards. (Four
<div n="lb"/>chapters from 305, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Education of Karṇa.%} Karṇa grew up in the house of
<div n="lb"/>Adhiratha in the country of Aṅga bearing the names
<div n="lb"/>Vasuṣeṇa and Vṛṣa. Kuntī knew this through spies.
<div n="lb"/>When the time came for imparting education to Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>Adhiratha sent him to Hastināpura to the presence of
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa for teaching him archery. Karṇa studied under
<div n="lb"/>Kṛpa and Paraśurāma also. After his education he
<div n="lb"/>entered into a treaty with Duryodhana. (Chapter 309,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Karṇa is cursed.%} Karṇa was cursed by a brahmin and
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. The story is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Even while they were studying archery Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa vied with each other. Karṇa once requested
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa to teach him in private the secret of the Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>missile to fight against Arjuna. But Droṇa did not
<div n="lb"/>accede to his request.
<div n="NI"/>Karṇa then went to Mahendragiri and bowed before
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma and represented himself as a member of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu family. He said he had come to him to be his
<div n="lb"/>disciple and learn the secret of the Brahmā missile from
<div n="lb"/>him. Paraśurāma believed him and accepting him as
<div n="lb"/>his disciple taught him many new techniques in archery.
<div n="lb"/>Once Karṇa was wandering in the vicinity of the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama when he saw a lonely cow grazing there and
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa without knowing that it belonged to a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>sent an arrow and killed it. The brahmin got furious
<div n="lb"/>and cursed Karṇa thus “Oh, sinner, the wheel of your
<div n="lb"/>chariot would go down in the mud when you face the
<div n="lb"/>enemy to fight against whom you are now taking training.
<div n="lb"/>Then, when you stand perplexed, your opponent would
<div n="lb"/>cut off your head.” Karṇa requested for a removal of
<div n="lb"/>the curse but the brahmin refused to show any mercy.
<div n="NI"/>Paraśurāma taught Karṇa the secret of the Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>missile. One day tired after a day's fast and a walk
<div n="lb"/>around the āśrama with his disciples Paraśurāma slept
<div n="lb"/>resting his head on the lap of Karṇa. Then a
<div n="lb"/>beetle named Alarka attacked Karṇa and started sucking
<div n="lb"/>blood from his thigh. Blood was oozing from his thigh
<div n="lb"/>and still Karṇa did not stir from his position lest it
<div n="lb"/>should disturb his guru in his nap. Suddenly Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma awoke and stared at the beetle and the beetle fell
[Page392-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>dead. It then took the form of a demon and rising up
<div n="lb"/>in the air said “Svāmin! I was once a demon called
<div n="lb"/>Daṃśa. Once I carried away by force the wife of the
<div n="lb"/>sage Bhṛgu and the angered sage cursed me and made
<div n="lb"/>me a beetle. When I craved for pardon he said
<div n="lb"/>that I would be given my original form by Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma.”
<div n="NI"/>When the demon disappeared saying so much Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma turned to Karṇa who stood with respect, his dress
<div n="lb"/>all covered with blood. Paraśurāma said: “No brah-
<div n="lb"/>min can bear so much pain with such patience. Surely,
<div n="lb"/>you are not a brahmin. Let me know the truth.” Trem-
<div n="lb"/>bling with fear Karṇa revealed his identity and then
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma cursed him saying “You will forget the
<div n="lb"/>secret of the Brahmā missile at the time when you want
<div n="lb"/>to use it against your enemy.” (Chapters 2 and 3, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%How Karṇa became the King of Aṅga.%} The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and Kauravas were studying archery under Droṇācārya
<div n="lb"/>together and Karṇa also was among them. When their
<div n="lb"/>education was complete a day was fixed to exhibit the
<div n="lb"/>skill of the students. The public also was invited to see
<div n="lb"/>the skill of the princes. Everybody showed his best and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna displayed super-human skill so that the vast
<div n="lb"/>assemblage was lost in wonder and admiration. Then
<div n="lb"/>strode Karṇa to the scene and not only did he duplicate
<div n="lb"/>with ease Arjuna's feats but he did show something
<div n="lb"/>more. The assemblage was dumbfounded. Arjuna turnn-
<div n="lb"/>ed pale. At this moment Kṛpa stood up and questioned
<div n="lb"/>the right of Karṇa to compete with those with royal
<div n="lb"/>blood in them. Then rose Duryodhana and said: “If
<div n="lb"/>the combat is not in order simply because Karṇa is not
<div n="lb"/>a prince it is easily remedied. I crown Karṇa as the
<div n="lb"/>King of Aṅga”. Then there came to the scene the aged
<div n="lb"/>Adhiratha, the foster-father of Karṇa, and as Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>saw him coming he went and bowed before him and
<div n="lb"/>Adhiratha embraced him with tears in his eyes. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ters 134 to 136, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Karṇa's armour and ear-rings.%} Karṇa was born with an
<div n="lb"/>armour on his body and rings in his ears. Chapter 99
<div n="lb"/>of Adi Parva says thus: “To Kuntī was born of Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>the mighty Karṇa. Even at his birth he was adorned
<div n="lb"/>with an armour over his body and rings in his ears.”
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya had ordained that as long as Karṇa wore the
<div n="lb"/>armour and ear-rings he would be unconquerable.
<div n="lb"/>Indra knew this and wanted to get Karṇa rid of these
<div n="lb"/>so that Arjuna, his son, might gain a victory over Karṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa was reputed for his charity and Indra under the
<div n="lb"/>garb of a brahmin went to Karṇa and begged of him
<div n="lb"/>his ear-rings and armour. The Sun god had already
<div n="lb"/>warned him in a dream that Indra would thus try to
<div n="lb"/>deceive him. Still Karṇa could not bring himself to refuse
<div n="lb"/>any gift that was asked of him and so he cut off the
<div n="lb"/>ear-rings and armour with which he was born and gave
<div n="lb"/>them to the Brāhmaṇa. The only request that the noble
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa did make was that in separating the ornaments
<div n="lb"/>from his body no wound should be made. Indra did it
<div n="lb"/>with great skill neither hurting him nor making even a
<div n="lb"/>scratch on this body. Indra bade Karṇa ask for any
<div n="lb"/>boon he wanted. The Sun god had also advised him to
<div n="lb"/>ask for a good weapon in return in case he gave away
<div n="lb"/>his assets and so he requested Indra the best of the
<div n="lb"/>weapons he possessed. Indra gave him his weapon, the
<div n="lb"/>Śakti, called Vaijayantī also. Karṇa had to use that
[Page392-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>weapon to kill the great Ghaṭotkaca in the Mahābhā-
<div n="lb"/>rata battle.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}

<div n="lb"/>below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Before the great war started Kuntī went alone to
<div n="lb"/>the shores of Gaṅgā and met Karṇa. She then confessed
<div n="lb"/>to him that she was his mother and that the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>were his brothers. She advised Karṇa to join sides with
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas and the Sun god approved of it. But
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa refused to do so. He said he would never forsake
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana who had brought him up from his child-
<div n="lb"/>hood at a time when he was in peril. But he promised
<div n="lb"/>his mother that he would never kill any of her other four
<div n="lb"/>sons but would kill Arjuna in the battle-field. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>146 Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Karṇa started his fight against the Pāṇḍavas after
<div n="lb"/>taking blessings from Bhīṣma. (Chapter 3, Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva).

<div n="NI"/>(vii) Karṇa insulted Kṛpācārya at one time. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>158, Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Karṇa killed Ghaṭotkaca with the weapon Śakti
<div n="lb"/>which Indra had given him in exchange for the armour

<div n="NI"/>9) {%Karṇa goes to heaven.%} After his death Karṇa went to
<div n="lb"/>heaven and merged with his father, the Sun god. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>20, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
