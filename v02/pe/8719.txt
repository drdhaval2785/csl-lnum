YAMAJIHVĀ¦. A prostitute. In Kathāsaritsāgara,
<div n="lb"/>Śaktiyaśolambaka, 1st Taraṅga, there is a story about
<div n="lb"/>her as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>In the city of Citrakūṭa Ratnavarmā a wealthy Vaiśya,
<div n="lb"/>had a son named Īśvaravarmā. In order to avoid his
<div n="lb"/>son falling under the influence of prostitutes, the father
<div n="lb"/>decided to teach “veśyātantram”, to Īśvaravarmā
<div n="lb"/>while he was a boy. Yamajihvā, the prostitute under-
<div n="lb"/>took this task for a reward of 1000 Niṣkas. (a gold coin
<div n="lb"/>of that time).
<div n="NI"/>After completing his education on the wiles and tricks
<div n="lb"/>of prostitutes, he was sent by his father to start a trade
<div n="lb"/>with a capital of five crores of Niṣkas. Īśvaravarmā
<div n="lb"/>and his friend Arthadatta on their way, stopped at a
<div n="lb"/>park on the outskirts of the city of Kāñcanapura.
<div n="lb"/>There he fell a victim to the bewitching charms of a
<div n="lb"/>prostitute named Sundarī. He spent the lion's share of
<div n="lb"/>the money given by his father, on her. On the advice of
<div n="lb"/>his friend Arthadatta he was about to leave the place
<div n="lb"/>when Sundarī pretended to be in danger of falling into
<div n="lb"/>a well and asked for his help. Īśvaravarmā was again
<div n="lb"/>caught in her trap and he was forced to spend the res
<div n="lb"/>of his money also on her. When he was rendered penni-
<div n="lb"/>less the prostitute and her mother deserted him.
<div n="NI"/>Īśvaravarmā returned home to his father, empty-hand-
<div n="lb"/>ed. Ratnavarmā took his son to Yamajihvā again and
<div n="lb"/>told her the whole story. He said that his son fell into
<div n="lb"/>this plight because Yamajihvā's training was not effect-
<div n="lb"/>ive. After listening to the whole story, Yamajihvā
<div n="lb"/>promised to recover the whole amount lost by Īśvara-
<div n="lb"/>varmā. She brought her trained monkey named “Āla”
<div n="lb"/>and placed 1,000 Niṣkas before him. She taught him to
<div n="lb"/>swallow the whole amount. After that, she taught him
<div n="lb"/>to give out by vomiting, the swallowed money in instal-
<div n="lb"/>ments of twenty, thirty, forty etc., as ordered. Then
<div n="lb"/>Yamajihvā said to Īśvaravarmā:—“Take this monkey
<div n="lb"/>with you and go to Sundarī's place. Make him swallow
<div n="lb"/>the money in secret and get it again from him, in
<div n="lb"/>instalments, in her presence. She would think that the
<div n="lb"/>monkey is an inexhaustible source of wealth and
<div n="lb"/>would be prepared to buy it at any cost—even
<div n="lb"/>by offering her whole wealth in return. At first you
<div n="lb"/>must pretend to be unwilling to part with the monkey.
<div n="lb"/>In the end, you must make him swallow 2,000 Niṣkas
<div n="lb"/>which he would be able to give out in two days at the
<div n="lb"/>rate of 1,000 on each day. Exchange him for her whole
<div n="lb"/>wealth and leave the place immediately.”
<div n="NI"/>With this advice Yamajihvā sent Īśvaravarmā with the
<div n="lb"/>monkey. He went to Kāñcanapura in the company of
<div n="lb"/>his friend Arthadatta after receiving two crores of Niṣkas
<div n="lb"/>from his father. When Sundarī knew that Īśvaravarmā
<div n="lb"/>had come again with more money, she welcomed him
<div n="lb"/>with due respect and invited him to live with her. He
<div n="lb"/>accepted her invitation and took up his residence there.
<div n="lb"/>One day, he brought the monkey into the house and in
<div n="lb"/>the presence of Sundarī asked him to produce various
<div n="lb"/>amounts of money for different purposes.
<div n="NI"/>The monkey promptly vomited the various amounts
<div n="lb"/>separately without making any mistake. Sundarī and
<div n="lb"/>her mother Makarakaṭī were naturally amazed at the
[Page894-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>marvellous performance of the monkey. Īśvaravarmā
<div n="lb"/>explained that the monkey was capable of giving in this
<div n="lb"/>way, 1,000 Niṣkas daily. Sundarī made up her mind to
<div n="lb"/>purchase the wonderful animal at any price. She request-
<div n="lb"/>ed Īśvaravarmā to give her the monkey in exchange for
<div n="lb"/>the crores of Niṣkas she had taken from him earlier.
<div n="lb"/>But he turned down her request. At last she persuaded
<div n="lb"/>him to sell the monkey to her for the entire wealth she
<div n="lb"/>possessed. Īśvaravarmā secretly made the monkey
<div n="lb"/>swallow 2,000 Niṣkas before handing it over to Sundarī
<div n="lb"/>and left the place at once to go to Svarṇadvīpa for
<div n="lb"/>trade.
<div n="NI"/>Āla, the monkey gave Sundarī 1,000 Niṣkas on each of
<div n="lb"/>the first two days, but on the third day she was disillu-
<div n="lb"/>sioned. In her disappointment and anger, she beat Ālan.
<div n="lb"/>The enraged monkey attacked both Sundarī and
<div n="lb"/>Makarakaṭī and harmed them by biting and tearing
<div n="lb"/>with its nails. They in turn, beat him to death. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Sundarī lost all her ill-gotten wealth and was reduced to
<div n="lb"/>utter poverty and distress.
