[Page167-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} Uttānapāda and Priyavrata were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Svāyambhuvamanu, and Dhruva was Uttāna-
<div n="lb"/>pāda's son. Dhruva had two sons, Śiṣṭi, and Bhavya
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Śambhu. Suchāyā, wife of Śiṣṭi, had five
<div n="lb"/>sons, viz., Ripu, Ripuñjaya, Vipra, Vṛkala and Vṛkate-
<div n="lb"/>jas. From Bṛhatī, wife of Ripu, was born Cākṣuṣa, the
<div n="lb"/>mighty and Cākṣuṣa begot a son called Manu by
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkaraṇī, daughter of Vīraṇaprajāpati and one of the
<div n="lb"/>offsprings of Varuṇa. This Manu was called Cākṣuṣa
<div n="lb"/>Manu. And Cākṣuṣa Manu had ten sons by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Nadvalā, daughter of Vairājaprajāpati, called Kuru,
<div n="lb"/>Puru, Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satyavān, Śuci, Agni-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭoma, Atirātra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Out of
<div n="lb"/>the ten, Puru had the following sons by Āgneyī, viz.
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga, Sumanas, Khyāti, Kratu, Aṅgiras and Śibi.
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga married Sunīthā, and Vena was their son. The
<div n="lb"/>famous emperor, Pṛthu was Vena's son.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Former life.%} The following story is told in the
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa about the former life of Cākṣuṣa
<div n="lb"/>before he was born as Cākṣuṣa. In that former life he
<div n="lb"/>was Ānanda, son of Anamitra. Once a cat carried
<div n="lb"/>Ānanda away and laid him on the bed of the child of
<div n="lb"/>King Vikrānta, and the same cat deposited the king's
<div n="lb"/>child somewhere else. And, Ānanda grew up as the
<div n="lb"/>real son of the King. But, one day he told the King
<div n="lb"/>the truth about him and left for the forest for tapas.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appeared before him and blessed that he
<div n="lb"/>would, in the next birth, be born as the sixth Manu
<div n="lb"/>and thus Cākṣuṣa became the sixth Manu.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Chief incidents during his time.%} During Cākṣuṣaman-
<div n="lb"/>vantara were born the famous Nara and Nārāyaṇa as
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Dharma. It was also during this period that
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was born as Candra, Viṣṇu as Dattātreya and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva as Durvāsas from Anasūyā, the purest of women
<div n="lb"/>and the wife of Atri. (Devī Bhāgavata, Caturtha
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
