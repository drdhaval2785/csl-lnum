LĪLĀVATĪ II¦. A prostitute who attained Svarga by
<div n="lb"/>simply observing the Śuklāṣṭamīvrata in the month of
<div n="lb"/>Proṣṭhapada in which was born Rādhādevī. Chapter
<div n="lb"/>seven, Brahmakhaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa contains the
<div n="lb"/>following story.
<div n="NI"/>In times of old in Kṛtayuga there was a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>prostitute of the name Līlāvatī. Once she went away
<div n="lb"/>from her own town to another in search of better pros-
<div n="lb"/>pects. There she saw a big assemblage of people in a
<div n="lb"/>temple. They were observing Rādhāṣṭamīvrata and
<div n="lb"/>worshipping their deity with scented flowers and incense
<div n="lb"/>of sweet fragrance. Some were reciting prayers, some
<div n="lb"/>were singing and yet others were dancing. The whole
<div n="lb"/>atmosphere was filled with devotion. Līlāvatī went to
<div n="lb"/>them and enquired about it. They told her that that
<div n="lb"/>day was the birthday of Rādhādevī, the Śuklāṣṭamī of
<div n="lb"/>the month of Proṣṭhapada, and if anyone observed
<div n="lb"/>Vrata on that day worshipping Rādhādevī he would be
<div n="lb"/>absolved of all sins.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing that, Līlāvati decided to observe the Vrata.
<div n="lb"/>She joined the devotees of the temple and observed the
<div n="lb"/>Vrata with great devotion. Soon she died of snake-bite
<div n="lb"/>and the servants of Yama came to take her soul to hell
<div n="lb"/>because of the sins she had committed as a prostitute.
<div n="lb"/>But before the Yamadūtas could touch her, Pārṣadas
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu wearing the insignia of Śaṅkha, Cakra,
<div n="lb"/>Gadā and Padma came to her with a chariot drawn
<div n="lb"/>by kingly swans and took her to heaven.
