MUKTĀPHALAKETU¦. A Vidyādhara youth. The
<div n="lb"/>story of this young man who was born to kill Vidyud-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja, a fire-brand of an asura, is told thus in Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara.
<div n="NI"/>An eminent asura of name Vidyutprabha performed
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Brahmā to get a son. As a
<div n="lb"/>result of the blessings of Brahmā he got a son invincible
<div n="lb"/>to the Devas. He was named Vidyuddhvaja. Even
<div n="lb"/>from boyhood he was very brave and daring. Once
<div n="lb"/>when he saw some demons standing guard to protect
<div n="lb"/>the asura family he said “At present our country is
<div n="lb"/>being protected by the hands of others. I shall, there-
<div n="lb"/>fore, perform penance and obtain boons to remove
<div n="lb"/>this disgrace. I will conquer our enemies.” Vidyud-
[Page508-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja went straight to the forests and performed penance
<div n="lb"/>to propitiate Brahmā. When the austerities became
<div n="lb"/>severe, Vidyuddhvaja observed fasting without break
<div n="lb"/>and the whole world became excited due to anxiety.
<div n="lb"/>So Brahmā appeared before him in person and gave
<div n="lb"/>him many divine weapons like Brahmāstra. For
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāstra the only counter-missile was Pāśupata
<div n="lb"/>and so Brahmā warned him that it should be used
<div n="lb"/>only when it was found absolutely necessary.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyuddhvaja became arrogant with the possession of
<div n="lb"/>such divine weapons and started for Indraloka with
<div n="lb"/>his father and his army to conquer Indra. He knew
<div n="lb"/>that Indra was ready to face him with a big army
<div n="lb"/>headed by Candraketu and Padmaśekhara.
<div n="NI"/>The battle that ensued was very grim. Even Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and Rudra came to see the fight. In a combat with
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Vidyutprabha was killed. Vidyuddhvaja saw
<div n="lb"/>his father killed, got furious and sent Brahmāstra
<div n="lb"/>against Indra who in turn opposed it with Pāśupata.
<div n="lb"/>Vidyuddhvaja fainted. Devas sounded the trumpets of
<div n="lb"/>victory and left the place.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Vidyuddhvaja awoke from the swoon
<div n="lb"/>and lamented thus to those of his men who were
<div n="lb"/>around:—“My tapobala (strength resulting from
<div n="lb"/>penance) was of no use. I have decided to die fighting
<div n="lb"/>against Indra. I do not want to return to a country
<div n="lb"/>where my father is not alive. On hearing this his aged
<div n="lb"/>minister pointed out to him his mistake in having
<div n="lb"/>used the Brahmāstra untimely.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyuddhvaja decided to attain more powers and so
<div n="lb"/>he went to the base of the Himālayas to perform
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Śiva. Pleased at his penance of
<div n="lb"/>five thousand years Śiva appeared in person and asked
<div n="lb"/>him to name the boon he wanted. Vidyuddhvaja
<div n="lb"/>demanded “I must be able to kill Indra in a battle.”
<div n="lb"/>Śiva granted him the boon.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyuddhvaja once again attacked Indra with a huge
<div n="lb"/>army. In the fierce battle that followed Indra fell
<div n="lb"/>down fainting by the weapons of Vidyuddhvaja. At
<div n="lb"/>once a voice from the air commanded, “Take away
<div n="lb"/>Indra from the battlefield. It is dangerous to keep
<div n="lb"/>him there” Vāyu came and carried him away swiftly.
<div n="lb"/>When Indra awoke from fainting he went to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaloka with all the other devas.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyuddhvaja established himself in Amarāvatī, the
<div n="lb"/>capital city of Indra and lived there enjoying his life
<div n="lb"/>as Indra. In the meantime Candraketu, King of the
<div n="lb"/>Vidyādharas was sitting in Vāyuloka musing thus, “How
<div n="lb"/>long should we remain thus displaced from our
<div n="lb"/>positions! There is no waning of the power of Vidyud-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja. My friend Padmaśekhara, King of Gandhar-
<div n="lb"/>vas, has gone to Śivapura to perform penance. I do
<div n="lb"/>not know whether he has been blessed by god. Anyhow
<div n="lb"/>I will act after hearing from him.”
<div n="NI"/>As his musings came to an end Padmaśekhara himself
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and said: “I have come to tell you
<div n="lb"/>the glad news that Śiva told me. Śiva said “Son, do
<div n="lb"/>not grieve. You will get your country back. You will
<div n="lb"/>get a son and a daughter. They will be top-ranking
<div n="lb"/>men in all activities. The husband of your daughter
<div n="lb"/>will kill Vidyuddhvaja.”
<div n="NI"/>A happy Candraketu went to Kailāsa with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Muktāvalī and started penance. Padmaśekhara went
<div n="lb"/>and mentioned to the devas all that had happened.
<div n="lb"/>The devas then went to Mahāviṣṇu and told him of
[Page508-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the boons which Vidyuddhvaja had received from Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and how he was ruling Indraloka then. After hearing
<div n="lb"/>them patiently Viṣṇu said that only Śiva could do
<div n="lb"/>anything in that matter. They all then went to the
<div n="lb"/>temple of Siddhīśvara and sat there meditating on
<div n="lb"/>Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>In the meantime Bhagavān appeared before Candraketu
<div n="lb"/>and blessed him and said he would get a very valorous
<div n="lb"/>son who would kill Vidyuddhvaja and restore Devaloka
<div n="lb"/>to the devas. But after that he would be born as a man
<div n="lb"/>on earth by a curse. Padmāvatī daughter of a
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva King, would by the strength of her penance
<div n="lb"/>release him from the curse and help him to get his
<div n="lb"/>original state as a Gandharva. He would then marry
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī and remain as emperor of the Vidyādharas
<div n="lb"/>for ten Kalpas together. Candaraketu and wife came
<div n="lb"/>back to Vāyuloka.
<div n="NI"/>At this time Śiva appeared in person to those sitting
<div n="lb"/>in the temple of Siddhīśvara and said that a son would
<div n="lb"/>be born to Candraketu from a part of his and that
<div n="lb"/>valorous youth would kill Vidyuddhvaja. Muktāvalī
<div n="lb"/>wife of Candraketu became pregnant at that time and
<div n="lb"/>soon delivered a son. He was named Muktāphalaketu.
<div n="lb"/>Even from boyhood he became an ardent devotee of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and started performing penance to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Śiva appeared before him and gave him the
<div n="lb"/>secrets of many techniques in archery.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyuddhvaja was once bathing in a river when muddy
<div n="lb"/>waters flowed from up the river and the arrogant
<div n="lb"/>demon sent a servant to find out the cause thereof.
<div n="lb"/>When he went up by the shores he saw an ox and an
<div n="lb"/>elephant bathing in the river. They were the Vāhanas
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva and Indra. The elephant was the famous
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata. He came back and intimated to Vidyuddhvaja
<div n="lb"/>what he saw. The demon then ordered his people to
<div n="lb"/>bring the culprits to his side. But the Vāhanas killed
<div n="lb"/>those who went to capture them and then they went
<div n="lb"/>to their masters, Śiva and Indra. Hearing about this
<div n="lb"/>audacity of the demon-chief the Devas challenged the
<div n="lb"/>asuras to a fight. This time the army of the devas was
<div n="lb"/>led by Muktāphalaketu.
<div n="NI"/>A Gandharva princess named Padmāvatī grew up to
<div n="lb"/>be a beautiful maiden at that time. She was in love
<div n="lb"/>with Muktāphalaketu. Padmāvatī was one day plucking
<div n="lb"/>flowers from a pond in the Gandharva land thinking
<div n="lb"/>about Muktāphalaketu who had gone to war against
<div n="lb"/>the asuras. A demoness who was going to eat flesh in the
<div n="lb"/>battle-field of the devas and asuras saw Padmāvatī, took
<div n="lb"/>her and went up. Muktāphalaketu coming to know of
<div n="lb"/>this went up with her and got back Padmāvatī who was
<div n="lb"/>struggling in the hands of the demoness like streaks of
<div n="lb"/>lightning among clouds. Then he asked her maids about
<div n="lb"/>her and they said, “She is the daughter of the Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>King Padmaśekhara. Padmāvatī is her name. She is
<div n="lb"/>unmarried. But she is betrothed to the son of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>ketu named Muktāphalaketu, who is born to destroy
<div n="lb"/>Vidyuddhvaja. She has come here to practise
<div n="lb"/>penance for the success of her father and Muktāphala-
<div n="lb"/>ketu in this war between devas and asuras.”
<div n="NI"/>Padmāvatī recognised Muktāphalaketu from the words
<div n="lb"/>of his followers. But the latter had to go back to Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka under instructions from Indra. The Devāsura war be-
<div n="lb"/>came fierce. By the valour and skill of Muktāphalaketu
<div n="lb"/>many of the asuras were killed. The war was won.
<div n="lb"/>Muktāphalaketu was given a grand reception at devaloka
[Page509-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and was then sent back. Muktāphalaketu did not seem
<div n="lb"/>to be happy and everybody thought that it might be
<div n="lb"/>due to his having killed Vidyuddhvaja. But the real
<div n="lb"/>cause was his separation from Padmāvatī.
<div n="NI"/>A sorrow-stricken Padmāvatī sent her female companion
<div n="lb"/>Manoharikā to the country of Vidyādharas to enquire
<div n="lb"/>about Muktāphalaketu. What she saw there was a sad
<div n="lb"/>Muktāphalaketu pining to see Padmāvatī. Both now
<div n="lb"/>understood each other and Manoharikā returned with
<div n="lb"/>presents for Padmāvatī from Muktāphalaketu.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Muktāphalaketu went to see a Maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>named Tapodhana. Disregarding the objections of
<div n="lb"/>the disciple Dṛḍhavrata who stood guard outside the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama Muktāphalaketu entered the āśrama with his
<div n="lb"/>friend. Dṛḍhavrata followed them. When they entered
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama they found the āśrama empty and at once
<div n="lb"/>Dṛḍhavrata cursed them both to be born on earth as
<div n="lb"/>men. Padmāvatī fainted when she heard the news.
<div n="lb"/>When she regained her consciousness she started
<div n="lb"/>practising austerities sitting in a temple devoted to
<div n="lb"/>Gaurī, wife of Śiva. She meditated on her husband
<div n="lb"/>Muktāphalaketu in his life on earth and performed
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Śiva. By the grace of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>Muktāphalaketu got his original life and he married
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī and led a happy married life. (Taraṅga 2,
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatīlambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara.)
