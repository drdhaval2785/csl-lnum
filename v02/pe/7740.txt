UPAMANYU III¦. In the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa we come
<div n="lb"/>across another Upamanyu as the son of a hermit named
<div n="lb"/>Sutapas. Upamanyu reached the hermitage of Kaśyapa,
<div n="lb"/>with the idea of marrying Sumati, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa and the elder sister of Garuḍa. Nobody liked
<div n="lb"/>the idea of giving Sumati in marriage to that old man.
<div n="lb"/>The hermit got angry at this and cursed Kaśyapa that
<div n="lb"/>if he gave his daughter in marriage to any Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>his head would break into a hundred pieces. (Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>ṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
