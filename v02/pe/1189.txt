BHUJYU¦. A Rājaṛṣi (royal sage), the son of Tugra.
<div n="lb"/>King Tugra sent his son with an army across the sea to
<div n="lb"/>conquer the enemies in a distant island. When the boat
[Page142-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>in which they sailed had reached mid-ocean, it was
<div n="lb"/>caught in a storm and wrecked. The prince and the
<div n="lb"/>soldiers sank into the sea. At that time the prince prayed
<div n="lb"/>to the Aśvins who saved Bhujyu from drowning and
<div n="lb"/>carried him back to the palace in boats and chariots
<div n="lb"/>travelling through the air. This story is given in the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda where the adventures of Aśvins are describ-
<div n="lb"/>ed. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 17th Anuvāka, 116th
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta.).
