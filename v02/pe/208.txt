AMITRAJIT¦. A King. In his country there were innu-
<div n="lb"/>merable Śiva temples. Nārada Muni who was delighted
<div n="lb"/>by this sight, went to the Palace and said to Amitrajit:
<div n="lb"/>“In the city of Campakāvatī there is a Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>virgin named Malayagandhinī. She has been abducted
<div n="lb"/>by Kaṅkālaketu, a Rākṣasa. She has promised to marry
<div n="lb"/>the person who will rescue her from him. Therefore
<div n="lb"/>please save her from the Rākṣasa.” As suggested by
<div n="lb"/>Nārada Amitrajit killed Kaṅkālaketu in battle and
<div n="lb"/>recovered Malayagandhinī and married her. Vīra was
<div n="lb"/>their son. (Skanda Purāṇa).
