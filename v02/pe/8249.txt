VIDEGHA¦ MĀTHAVA A king born of the dynasty
<div n="lb"/>of Mathu. There is an interesting story about this
<div n="lb"/>king in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. It is as follows.
<div n="NI"/>Videgha put Agni in his mouth and lived without
<div n="lb"/>talking, fearing that Agni might jump out. His priest
<div n="lb"/>Rahūgaṇa tried to the utmost, but he could not extri-
<div n="lb"/>cate fire from the mouth of the king.
<div n="NI"/>Once by chance the word Ghṛta got out of the mouth of
<div n="lb"/>Rahūgaṇa. Instantly the fire in the mouth of the king
<div n="lb"/>blazed into a big flame and burst out of the mouth.
<div n="lb"/>That fire gradually increased and began to consume
<div n="lb"/>the world, Rivers became dry. It seemed that even
<div n="lb"/>Videgha and his priest would be burnt to ashes in that
<div n="lb"/>blazing fire. At last Videgha got into the river Sadā-
<div n="lb"/>nīrā, which flowed through the boundary of his own
<div n="lb"/>kingdom, with the intention of not becoming a prey to
<div n="lb"/>the ever-increasing fire. With this the fire abated.
