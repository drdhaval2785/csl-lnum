TILOTTAMĀ¦. A prominent celestial maiden.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Tilottamā was born to Pradhā, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci.
<div n="lb"/>Alambuṣā, Miśrakeśī, Vidyutparṇā, Aruṇā, Rakṣitā,
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā, Manoramā, Subāhu, Keśinī, Suratā, Surajā
<div n="lb"/>and Supriyā were all sisters of Tilottamā. (Chapter 65,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the birth of Tilottamā. Two
<div n="lb"/>demons named Sunda and Upasunda obtained invinci-
<div n="lb"/>ble powers by doing penance. To make these two
<div n="lb"/>brothers quarrel with each other, by directions from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Viśvakarmā created Tilottamā. Viśvakarmā
<div n="lb"/>collected from all inanimate and animate objects parts
<div n="lb"/>of objects beautiful to look at and created the enchant-
<div n="lb"/>ing Tilottamā. Tilottamā was then made to come to
<div n="lb"/>the world through the womb of Kaśyapa's wife. Be-
<div n="lb"/>cause she was made by the tilāṃśa (small particle) of
<div n="lb"/>all the best (uttama) articles of the world she got the
<div n="lb"/>name of Tilottamā. (Chapter 215, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>The good girl named Tilottamā was formerly created
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmā from small particles of diamonds. (Śloka 1,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 141, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Śiva got four heads and Indra a thousand eyes.%}
<div n="lb"/>When the two demon brothers Sundopasundas were
<div n="lb"/>creating great havoc in the world by their cruel and
<div n="lb"/>immoral deeds, it was Tilottamā who was deputed by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā to create a split between the brothers. On the
<div n="lb"/>eve of her departure to the world she went to Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka to bid adieu. Brahmā stood facing south and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva stood facing north and Tilottamā stood in the
<div n="lb"/>centre surrounded by the Devas. Tilottamā circled
<div n="lb"/>round the devas worshipping them. Śiva was enamour-
<div n="lb"/>ed of her beauty and wanted to see her always and so
<div n="lb"/>a face on all the four sides of his head sprang up so
<div n="lb"/>that he could see her always as she circled round him.
<div n="lb"/>Indra was also enamoured of her and he found his two
<div n="lb"/>eyes insufficient to enjoy her beauty. So instantly a
<div n="lb"/>thousand eyes sprang up in the face of Indra. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>215, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Tilottamā cursed Sahasrānīka.%} (See under
<div n="lb"/>Sahasrānīka).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Tilottamā and Sundopasundas.%} See under Sunda.

[Page789-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>festival) of Arjuna. (Śloka 62, Chapter 122, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata).
