SAVYA¦. A son of Aṅgiras, Savya is actually Indra him-
<div n="lb"/>self. The story is that Aṅgiras began worshipping the
<div n="lb"/>Devatās for a son equal to Indra and that Indra, think-
<div n="lb"/>ing that there should not be another person equal to
<div n="lb"/>him, got himself born as the son of Aṅgiras. That son
<div n="lb"/>is Savya. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 10, Sūkta 51).
