DĪPAKARṆI¦. A character in Guṇāḍhya's Bṛhatkathā.
<div n="lb"/>Dīpakarṇi was a King. He had a wife named
<div n="lb"/>Śaktimatī. One day while she was sleeping in the gar-
<div n="lb"/>den she was bitten by a snake and she died. Distressed
<div n="lb"/>by her departure, Dīpakarṇi accepted Brahmacarya.
<div n="lb"/>He was deeply grieved because he had no son to
<div n="lb"/>succeed to his throne. One day Śiva appeared to him
<div n="lb"/>in a dream and told him thus:—“When you pass
<div n="lb"/>through the forest, you will come across a youth riding
<div n="lb"/>a lion. Take him to your palace; he will be your son.”
<div n="NI"/>Dīpakarṇi woke up happily. He had faith in his dream.
<div n="lb"/>One day he went to a distant forest for hunting.
<div n="lb"/>There he saw a very handsome boy riding on a lion.
<div n="lb"/>He was reminded of his dream when the boy dismounted
[Page243-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>and the lion walked away slowly to a nearby stream to
<div n="lb"/>drink water. At once Dīpakarṇi shot an arrow at the
<div n="lb"/>lion. Suddenly the lion gave up its animal shape and
<div n="lb"/>transformed itself into a man and spoke to the King as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I am a Yakṣa named Sāta and a friend of Vaiśravaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Once when I went to bathe in the river Gaṅgā, I
<div n="lb"/>happened to see a Ṛṣi virgin and I fell in love with her.
<div n="lb"/>I married her according to the Gāndharva rules. The
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣis who came to know of it turned us into a lion
<div n="lb"/>couple by their curse. When we fell at their feet and
<div n="lb"/>begged pardon, they gave her a blessing that a son
<div n="lb"/>would be born to her and that I would fall under your
<div n="lb"/>arrow. After that we were wandering about as a
<div n="lb"/>lion-couple and in due course she became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>In the fullness of time she gave birth to this boy and
<div n="lb"/>then was liberated from the curse. I have been bringing
<div n="lb"/>him up by giving the milk of lionesses. Now, by being
<div n="lb"/>hit by your arrow, I am also released from the curse.
<div n="lb"/>From this time kindly receive this mighty youth as
<div n="lb"/>your own.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this, the Yakṣa vanished. Dīpakarṇi
<div n="lb"/>returned to the palace, taking the boy with him. Since
<div n="lb"/>he was carried by Sāta, the boy was named “Sātavā-
<div n="lb"/>hana”. When he grew up into a youth, Dīpakarṇi
<div n="lb"/>handed over the rule of the kingdom to him and
<div n="lb"/>entered into Vānaprastha. In course of time Sātavāhana
<div n="lb"/>became an emperor. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha
<div n="lb"/>lambaka, 6th Taraṅga.).
