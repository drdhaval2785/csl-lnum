NALA I¦. Nala the King of Niṣadha. (As the history of
<div n="lb"/>Nala is included under the word Damayantī, some
<div n="lb"/>points which are not given there, are mentioned here).
<div n="NI"/>(i) Nala was the son of Vīrasena, the King of Niṣadha.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 56).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once the hermit Bṛhadaśva came to the Palace of
<div n="lb"/>Vīrasena and praised Nala a good deal and spoke
<div n="lb"/>highly of his good qualities to his father. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) When Nala was playing in the garden some swans
<div n="lb"/>with golden wings flew to the lake in the garden. Nala
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of one of them just for fun. The swan said
<div n="lb"/>to Nala, “If you will let me off, I will tell Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>about you.” So it was released. As a reward it flew to
[Page519-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the country of Vidarbha and persuaded Damayantī to
<div n="lb"/>love Nala. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) After death Nala sat in the aerial chariot of Indra
<div n="lb"/>and witnessed the battle fought by Arjuna with the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas at the end of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 56, Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Previous birth. Two different stories are narrated
<div n="lb"/>about the previous birth of Nala.
<div n="NI"/>1) In the previous birth Nala was a Vaiśya of the
<div n="lb"/>city of Pippala in the Gauḍa country. This Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>became abstinent and after leaving off everything he
<div n="lb"/>had, he went to the forest. There, according to the
<div n="lb"/>advice of a hermit he undertook the fast of Gaṇeśa.
<div n="lb"/>As a result he was born as Nala in the next birth.
<div n="lb"/>(Gaṇeśa Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) Nala and Damayantī were foresters named Āhuka
<div n="lb"/>and Āhukā. Śiva was pleased with the couple. So they
<div n="lb"/>were born in royal families in the next birth, and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>in the form of a swan, helped them. (Śiva Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Śatarudra Saṃhitā).
