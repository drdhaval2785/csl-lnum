GOVARDHANA¦. A mountain of Ambāḍi (Gokula).
<div n="lb"/>This is believed to be a form of Kṛṣṇa. This is called
<div n="lb"/>Girirāja also. The residents of Ambāḍi from time imme-
<div n="lb"/>morial used to worship Indra for getting rains. But
<div n="lb"/>after the advent of Kṛṣṇa there came a change in that
<div n="lb"/>belief. Kṛṣṇa told them that rains depended on Govar-
<div n="lb"/>dhana and it was enough if they worshipped that moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain and so the residents of Ambāḍi started worshipping
<div n="lb"/>the mountain. Indra got enraged at this and sent heavy
<div n="lb"/>rains to Ambāḍī intending to submerge it in water. But
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa lifted the mountain over Ambāḍi like an um-
<div n="lb"/>brella and saved the city from the wrath of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. See under ‘Kṛṣṇa’ for more details. (Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata)
