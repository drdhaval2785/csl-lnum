BĀLĀVATĪ¦. The daughter of hermit Kaṇva. She did
<div n="lb"/>penance to please the Sun to obtain a husband of a
<div n="lb"/>very good nature. The Sun appeared before her and gave
<div n="lb"/>her some dates and asked her to prepare food with them
<div n="lb"/>and bring them back. Bālāvatī began to cook the dates.
<div n="lb"/>Though all the faggots she had gathered were consumed
<div n="lb"/>it was not properly boiled. As there was no more fire-
<div n="lb"/>wood she put her leg into the oven. Seeing this the Sun-
<div n="lb"/>God was pleased and said “All your wishes will be
<div n="lb"/>realized”. From that day onwards that place was called
<div n="lb"/>by the name ‘Bālāpa’. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 152).
