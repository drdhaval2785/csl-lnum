AITAREYA II¦. Son of Sage, Māṇḍuki by his first wife,
<div n="lb"/>Itarā. Being the son of Itarā he came to be called Aita-
<div n="lb"/>reya. As a boy he was very pious and used to chant the
<div n="lb"/>mantra “Namo Bhagavate Vāsudevāya” frequently. But
<div n="lb"/>he was a shy and silent boy and his father mistook his
<div n="lb"/>silence to be a sign of stupidity. Dissatisfied with him and
<div n="lb"/>being desirous of having learned sons, Māṇḍuki married
<div n="lb"/>another woman named Piṅgā and had four sons by her
<div n="lb"/>who all became very learned. Once Itarā called her
<div n="lb"/>son and told him that his father regarded him as an
<div n="lb"/>unworthy son and was often twitting her using insulting
<div n="lb"/>words for having given birth to so unworthy a son. She
<div n="lb"/>then told him of her resolve to sacrifice her life. Aita-
<div n="lb"/>reya then made an enlightening discourse to her and
<div n="lb"/>dissuaded her from her determination to commit suicide.
<div n="lb"/>Some time later Lord Viṣṇu appeared before them and
<div n="lb"/>blessed the mother and son. On the advice of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya participated in the yajña conducted by Hari-
[Page019-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>medhya at Koṭitīrtha and there he made a learned
<div n="lb"/>speech on the Vedas. Harimedhya was so pleased with
<div n="lb"/>him that he gave his daughter in marriage to him.
<div n="lb"/>(See Skanda Purāṇa, Chapters 1, 2 and 42).
