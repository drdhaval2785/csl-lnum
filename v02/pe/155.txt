AKṢAYAPĀTRA¦. This is a copper vessel given to
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra by Sūrya (Sun). To destroy the Pāṇḍavas,
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana kept them in a palace made of lac. They
<div n="lb"/>escaped from there and passing through dense forests
<div n="lb"/>crossed the river Ganges and reached the Kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla where they married the King's daughter,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇā (Pāñcālī). On their way they killed two demons
<div n="lb"/>called Hidimba and Baka. When they were living hap-
<div n="lb"/>pily at Indraprastha the jealous Duryodhana defeated
<div n="lb"/>them in a game of dice by foul play and sent them for a
<div n="lb"/>period of twelve years to the forests. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>found it impossible to feed the innumerable subjects who
[Page023-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>faithfully followed them to the forest. Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>then prayed to the God, Sūrya and he appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and gave him this Akṣaya Pātra (Akṣaya=never
<div n="lb"/>getting empty, Pātra=pot). Everyday this pot never
<div n="lb"/>got empty till the meals of Pāñcālī were over. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>3, Vana Parva, M.B.). See also under Duryodhana,
<div n="lb"/>Para 12.
