MAYIL¦ (PEACOCK). In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa there is
<div n="lb"/>a story about how the peacock got its beauty. Mayil in
<div n="lb"/>Malayālam means peacock.
<div n="NI"/>Once Rāvaṇa set out in his Puṣpaka Vimāna with his
<div n="lb"/>army of Rākṣasas, determined to gain victory over all
<div n="lb"/>Kings. They got down on the mountain called Uśīravīra.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa examined the valley to see whether there were
<div n="lb"/>any Kings doing tapas anywhere there. A King named
<div n="lb"/>Marutta was performing a yāga called “Māheśvara” in
<div n="lb"/>an āśrama. Indra and other gods were also present to
<div n="lb"/>receive the share of offerings (Havirbhāga). At the sight
<div n="lb"/>of Rāvaṇa, the gods took different disguises and fled
<div n="lb"/>in panic. At that time Indra assumed the form of a big
<div n="lb"/>peacock. As soon as Rāvaṇa left the place, the gods re-
<div n="lb"/>assembled there. From that time, Indra who put on the
<div n="lb"/>disguise of a peacock felt a special attachment to that
<div n="lb"/>bird. He called the peacock and said:—“Till now you
<div n="lb"/>were blue in colour. But from today onwards, your
<div n="lb"/>feathers will have various colours. All my thousand eyes
[Page499-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>I transfer to you Besides, you will be immune from all
<div n="lb"/>diseases. Whoever kills you, will meet with death, soon
<div n="lb"/>after. You will dance at the commencement of the rainy
<div n="lb"/>season. People will greet you with enthusiasm.”
<div n="NI"/>It is because of Indra's blessing that Peacocks are so
<div n="lb"/>beautiful in appearance and dance at the onset of the
<div n="lb"/>rainy season.
