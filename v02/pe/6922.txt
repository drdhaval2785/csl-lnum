SUDARŚANA¦ X. The son of Dīrghabāhu who was born
<div n="lb"/>in the family of Manu. He conquered all the kingdoms
<div n="lb"/>and ruled as an emperor. The famous hermit Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>was his priest.
<div n="NI"/>Once Devī Mahākālī appeared to him in a dream and
<div n="lb"/>said to him: “Very soon a flood will occur in the world.
<div n="lb"/>So go to the Himālayas with your wife and the priest
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and stay there in a cave.” According to the
<div n="lb"/>instruction of Devī, Sudarśana took everybody with him
<div n="lb"/>and went to the Himālayas.
<div n="NI"/>The prophecy of Devī came true. The earth was filled
<div n="lb"/>with water. This deluge lasted for ten years. After
<div n="lb"/>that the earth resumed its original form and Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ayodhyā. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Pratisarga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, 1, 1).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Kālikā Purāṇa that Sudarśana had
<div n="lb"/>broken off a piece of a forest region of Himālaya and
<div n="lb"/>taken it to his country and founded on it the city called
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍavīnagara and that after a short period king
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya of the Bhairava dynasty killed king Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>and became the ruler of the city. (Kālikā Purāṇa, 92).
