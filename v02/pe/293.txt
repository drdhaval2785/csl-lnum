AṄGA¦. A King belonging to the Candra vaṃśa. (Lunar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order: Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa-Yayāti-Anudruhyu-Sabhānara-Kālanara-
<div n="lb"/>Sṛñjaya-Titikṣa-Kuśadhṛta-Homa-Sutapas-Bali-Aṅga.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Aṅga, Kaliṅga, Suhma, Kaṇḍra, Vaṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Adrupa and Anaśābhu are the seven sons born to Bali,
<div n="lb"/>the son of Sutapas, by his wife Suteṣṇā, and the King
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga is one of them. There is a story about the birth
<div n="lb"/>of these sons.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived a hermit named Utatthya. He was
<div n="lb"/>the elder brother of Bṛhaspati. One day when Mamatā,
<div n="lb"/>Utatthya's wife, was pregnant, Bṛhaspati approached
<div n="lb"/>her with carnal desires. In spite of her efforts to dis-
<div n="lb"/>suade her brother-in-law from his attempts she could not
<div n="lb"/>prevail upon him. He forced her and satisfied his desire.
<div n="lb"/>The child in her womb protested and kicked the sperm
<div n="lb"/>of Bṛhaspati out into the floor. Bṛhaspati got angry and
<div n="lb"/>cursed the child in the womb: “May you fall in perpe-
<div n="lb"/>tual darkness”. So the child was born blind and
<div n="lb"/>remained blind throughout his life. Hence he got the
<div n="lb"/>name ‘Dīrghatamas’. Dīrghatamas married Pradveṣi. A
<div n="lb"/>son named Gautama was born to them. The duty of
<div n="lb"/>supporting Dīrghatamas fell upon the wife and the son,
<div n="lb"/>who put him on a raft and pushed him astray into the
<div n="lb"/>River Ganges. King Bali, who was bathing in the river
<div n="lb"/>saw this. He rescued the hermit and took him to the
<div n="lb"/>palace and pleasing him by hospitality, requested him
<div n="lb"/>to beget children in his wife Suteṣṇā, who detesting the
<div n="lb"/>idea sent a Śūdrā woman Dhātreyī in her stead and
<div n="lb"/>eleven children were born to them. By and by Dīrgha-
<div n="lb"/>tamas came to know of the deceit played by Suteṣṇā on
<div n="lb"/>him and he became very angry. But the King pacified
<div n="lb"/>him and pleased him again and Dīrghatamas begot five
<div n="lb"/>sons by Suteṣṇā. They were Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Pauṇḍra and Suhma. Dīrghatamas blessed them that they
<div n="lb"/>would become very famous. Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Pauṇḍra and Suhma were the five kingdoms ruled by
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Pauṇḍra and Suhma respectively.
<div n="lb"/>These five are the famous Kings of the Bāli family.
<div n="lb"/>(Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 104).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Aṅga got children.%} Once Aṅga performed a
<div n="lb"/>horse sacrifice. But the gods did not appear to receive
[Page037-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>oblations. Holy seers said that the Gods refused to
<div n="lb"/>accept the oblations offered by the King because he was
<div n="lb"/>childless. So he performed the sacrifice called Putrakā-
<div n="lb"/>meṣṭi (Sacrifice to get a son) and from the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>fire arose a divine person with a golden flask of pud-
<div n="lb"/>ding, which he offered to the King and his queen. The
<div n="lb"/>King and the queen Sunīthā ate the pudding, as a
<div n="lb"/>result of which a son was born to them. He was named
<div n="lb"/>Vena. This son was wicked. Because of his wickedness
<div n="lb"/>the King became so miserable that he left his kingdom
<div n="lb"/>and went on a pilgrimage. Since there was no other
<div n="lb"/>means the people enthroned Vena, who tortured his
<div n="lb"/>subjects beyond limit. (Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ters Band 14).
