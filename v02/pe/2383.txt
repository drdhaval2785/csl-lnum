GAUTAMA¦. V. An ungrateful brahmin. He was born
<div n="lb"/>in Madhyadeśa. He left his parents and after travelling
<div n="lb"/>in many lands he came to a country of foresters. The
<div n="lb"/>foresters received him with respect and he lived in a
<div n="lb"/>hut of the foresters and married a lady from among
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama abandoned his brahminhood and accepted
<div n="lb"/>the duties of foresters. He was living like this when
<div n="lb"/>another brahmin boy came to that village. He searched
<div n="lb"/>in vain for a brahmin house to stay for the night and
<div n="lb"/>then knowing that a man born a brahmin but made
<div n="lb"/>a forester by his duties was living there he went to his
<div n="lb"/>house. Gautama also came there carrying the animals
<div n="lb"/>and birds he had hunted down that day. His body
<div n="lb"/>was bathed in blood. The brahmin guest felt com-
<div n="lb"/>passion for Gautama and advised him to leave his
<div n="lb"/>trade and go to his house in his country.
<div n="NI"/>In the morning the brahmin guest went away without
<div n="lb"/>taking any food. The advice of his guest kept him
<div n="lb"/>thinking. He decided to abandon his life as a hunter
<div n="lb"/>and so leaving everything behind he went to the sea-
<div n="lb"/>shore. He met some merchants on the way and while
<div n="lb"/>they were travelling together a wild elephant attacked
<div n="lb"/>them. Many were killed and Gautama escaping ran
<div n="lb"/>swiftly and came to the base of a big banyan tree.
<div n="lb"/>He was tired and slept there for a while.
<div n="NI"/>A big vulture named Nāḍījaṃgha lived on the top of
<div n="lb"/>that banyan tree. He used to go out to worship Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>at dusk and when he returned to his abode that day
<div n="lb"/>he saw a man lying wearied down below. Gautama
<div n="lb"/>attempted to catch the vulture and eat it but the
<div n="lb"/>vulture playing a benign host placed before Gautama
<div n="lb"/>food for him and made enquiries about him and asked
<div n="lb"/>him the purpose of his travels. Gautama told him that
<div n="lb"/>he was very poor and that he wanted to acquire some
<div n="lb"/>wealth somehow.
<div n="NI"/>Nāḍījaṃgha then said that he would get for him enough
<div n="lb"/>wealth from the demon-King Virūpākṣa who was an
<div n="lb"/>intimate friend of his. Gautama was pleased. The
<div n="lb"/>vulture fanned him and sent him to sleep. Next morn-
<div n="lb"/>ing Nāḍījaṃgha sent Gautama to Virūpākṣa and the
<div n="lb"/>demon gave Gautama as much gold as he could carry
<div n="lb"/>on his shoulders.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama took the gold as a head load and came back
<div n="lb"/>to the base of the banyan tree. Nāḍījaṃgha came to him
<div n="lb"/>and they talked to each other for some time. Gautama
<div n="lb"/>who had become a gluttonous flesh eater looked with
<div n="lb"/>greed at the fat body of the vulture and in an instant
[Page287-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>killed it and packed the flesh along with the load of
<div n="lb"/>gold and went his way.
<div n="NI"/>Virūpākṣa did not see Nāḍījaṃgha for two days and he
<div n="lb"/>was worried. He, therefore, sent his son to the banyan
<div n="lb"/>tree to look for Nāḍījaṃgha. When he reached the
<div n="lb"/>base of the tree he found to his grief only the bones
<div n="lb"/>and feathers of his father's friend. He knew what had
<div n="lb"/>happened and he immediately followed the ungrateful
<div n="lb"/>brahmin and capturing him brought him to his father
<div n="lb"/>bound hand and foot. Virūpākṣa without any mercy
<div n="lb"/>cut him into pieces and threw them for the crows to
<div n="lb"/>eat. But even the crows would not eat the flesh of such
<div n="lb"/>an ungrateful man.
<div n="NI"/>Virūpākṣa burnt the remains of Nāḍījaṃgha in a
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre. Devas assembled in the skies to watch
<div n="lb"/>the funeral. Then Surabhi sprinkled milk on the
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre and brought back Nāḍījaṃgha to life.
<div n="lb"/>The reborn vulture felt sorry for Gautama and request-
<div n="lb"/>ed Surabhi to restore to life the wretched Gautama
<div n="lb"/>also. Gautama also was brought back to life and he
<div n="lb"/>embraced Nāḍījaṃgha. Gautama then went away with
<div n="lb"/>his load of gold.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama returned to Śabarālaya and there married a
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra lady and begot evil sons. The devas were
<div n="lb"/>offended at this and cursing him condemned him to
<div n="lb"/>hell. (Chapters 168 to 173, Śānti Parva).
