KETAKĪ¦. (A flower). [Pandarnus odoratissimus]
<div n="lb"/>Though Ketakī is a flower which had been worn on
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's head, it is not worshipped for the following
<div n="lb"/>reason.
<div n="NI"/>In Satyayuga Mahāviṣṇu performed intense penance
<div n="lb"/>on the Śveta island for the attainment of eternal happi-
<div n="lb"/>ness. Brahmā also performed penance at a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful place for the annihilation of desires. During
<div n="lb"/>their tapas Viṣṇu and Brahmā, for a rest, left their
<div n="lb"/>seats and walked about in the forest when they met
<div n="lb"/>each other. There arose a controversy between them
<div n="lb"/>about their respective greatness when Śiva, in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a Liṅga, appeared between the two contestants and
<div n="lb"/>told them that he, who first found out his (Śiva's) head
<div n="lb"/>or feet was greater than the other. Accordingly Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>went down and Brahmā went up on a tour of
<div n="lb"/>enquiry.
<div n="NI"/>Though Viṣṇu went down deeper and deeper for a long
<div n="lb"/>time to find out Śiva's feet he failed in the attempt and so
<div n="lb"/>returned and sat at the place whence he started for the
<div n="lb"/>search. Brahmā went up a very long distance when he
<div n="lb"/>saw a Ketakī flower falling down from the sky. He took
<div n="lb"/>the flower in his hands and went to Viṣṇu and told him
<div n="lb"/>that he had found out Śiva's head and showed the
<div n="lb"/>Ketakī flower as proof of his discovery claiming that it
<div n="lb"/>was taken from Śiva's head. But Viṣṇu did not believe
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and asked the Ketakī flower to bear witness
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmā's claim. The flower gave false evidence in
<div n="lb"/>favour of Brahmā. Śiva got angry at this false evidence
<div n="lb"/>of Ketakī and cursed it. The Ketakī lost its place
<div n="lb"/>among the best flowers from that day onwards.
