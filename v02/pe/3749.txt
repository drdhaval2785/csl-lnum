KṢUPA I¦. A Prajāpati. There is a story about the
<div n="lb"/>birth of this Prajāpati in Mahābhārata. Once Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>wished to perform a sacrifice. But he could not get
<div n="lb"/>suitable priest as the performer of the sacrifice. So
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā decided to create a befitting person as Ṛtvik
<div n="lb"/>(the priest who does the rituals of the sacrifice) and
<div n="lb"/>he got pregnant in his head. After a thousand years he
<div n="lb"/>sneezed and a Prajāpati came out of the head of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. That Prajāpati was Kṣupa. He made Kṣupa
<div n="lb"/>his Ṛtvik. (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 122).
<div n="NI"/>Rudra Bhagavān made him Prajāpati (the Lord of all
<div n="lb"/>subjects).
