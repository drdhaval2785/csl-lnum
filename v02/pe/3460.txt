KĀYAVYA¦. A Caṇḍāla. He was born to a Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>woman as the son of a Kṣatriya. But the Caṇḍālas
<div n="lb"/>who were impressed by Kāyavya's moral conduct,
<div n="lb"/>made him the headman of the village. He taught
<div n="lb"/>others that all people should honour Brāhmaṇas and
<div n="lb"/>love their country. His political creed was that those
<div n="lb"/>who prospered by the ruin of a country were just like
<div n="lb"/>the worms living on a dead body. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 135).
