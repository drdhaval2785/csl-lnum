CANDRĀVALOKA¦. A King of Citrakūṭanagara.
<div n="NI"/>When once the King in the course of a hunting expedition
<div n="lb"/>came to the bank of a river tired and done up he saw
<div n="lb"/>there the very beautiful lady, Indīvaraprabhā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Maharṣi Kaṇva by Menakā. Having fallen in love
<div n="lb"/>with each other they went to the āśrama of the maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>where, at his instance, Candrāvaloka took the pledge not
<div n="lb"/>to kill animals in future, and Kaṇva married his daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter to the King. On their way back to the palace the
<div n="lb"/>couple went to sleep on the banks of a pool which be-
<div n="lb"/>longed to a Brahmarakṣas, who caught hold of them,
<div n="lb"/>but released them on condition that they gave him in
<div n="lb"/>their stead a brahmin boy aged seven. Thus they re-
<div n="lb"/>turned to Citrakūṭa and told about the incident to
<div n="lb"/>minister Sumati. As advised by Sumati an idol in gold
<div n="lb"/>equal in size to a brahmin boy aged seven was made and
<div n="lb"/>a proclamation was issued that the golden idol would
<div n="lb"/>be given to him who, in return, give a brahmin boy
<div n="lb"/>seven years old. A brahmin boy was got, and he was
<div n="lb"/>given to the Brahmarakṣas. (Kathāsaritsāgara Śaśāṅka-
<div n="lb"/>vatī Laṃbaka, Taraṅga 27).
