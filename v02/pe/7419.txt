SVAYAṂVARA II¦. A Kṣatriya custom of princesses
<div n="lb"/>selecting their husbands themselves. There are three
<div n="lb"/>kinds of Svayaṃvara. These three types are stipulated
<div n="lb"/>for Kings only. The first type is Icchāsvayamvara, the
<div n="lb"/>second one is Savyavasthāsvayaṃvara and the third is
<div n="lb"/>Śauryaśulkasvayaṃvara. No condition is attached to
<div n="lb"/>Icchāsvayaṃvara. Anybody may be chosen as husband
<div n="lb"/>according to the wish of the bride. Damayantī Svayaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>vara is an example of this. In the second it will be
<div n="lb"/>stipulated that the bridegroom will have to possess
<div n="lb"/>certain qualifications. In Sītā-Svayaṃvara Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>drew the bow of Tryambaka, and married Sītā. This is
<div n="lb"/>an example of the second type of Svayaṃvara. The
<div n="lb"/>third type is meant for adventurous heroes. Arjuna's
<div n="lb"/>marrying Subhadrā is an example of the third type of
<div n="lb"/>Svayaṃvara. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 3).
