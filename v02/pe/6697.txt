SOMĀŚRAYĀYAṆA¦. An ancient holy place situated
<div n="lb"/>in the basin of the Gaṅgā. The Pāṇḍavas visited this
<div n="lb"/>holy place while they were on their way to Pāñcāla
<div n="lb"/>from Ekacakrā. It was in this place that Citraratha
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva who had been defeated by Arjuna, had
<div n="lb"/>enjoyed bathing sports with girls. It was because of
<div n="lb"/>these two facts that Somāśrayāyaṇa became a holy
