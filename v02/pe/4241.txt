MĀLAVĪ¦. The queen of Aśvapati king of Madra. She
<div n="lb"/>was the mother of Sāvitrī. Aśvapati begot of Mālavī
<div n="lb"/>a hundred sons called Mālavas.
<div n="NI"/>Yama took to Kālapurī the soul of Satyavān who was
<div n="lb"/>shortlived. Sāvitrī, wife of Satyavān, followed Yama.
<div n="lb"/>Yama blessed Sāvitrī and said she would have many
<div n="lb"/>children and gave life to Satyavān again. Yama said
<div n="lb"/>“Satyavān will live for four hundred years and you will
<div n="lb"/>get a hundred sons of him. Your father Aśvapati also
<div n="lb"/>will get a hundred sons of Mālavī and the earth will
<div n="lb"/>get the name of Sāvitrī also”. Accordingly Mālavī got
<div n="lb"/>a hundred sons and they were called Mālavas. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>297, Vana Parva).
