<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu are
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Sūrya—Tapatī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Sūrya married Saṃjñā daughter of Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>karmā. He begot of Saṃjñā two children named
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī and Yama. At that time Sūrya (Sun) was not
<div n="lb"/>of the form as seen now. Saṃjñā, unable to bear the
<div n="lb"/>splendour of Sūrya who was of the shape of an egg
<div n="lb"/>entrusted her maid Chāyā with the work of serving her
<div n="lb"/>husband and left for a temple in the guise of a mare to
[Page786-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>do penance. Chāyā disguised as Saṃjñā served Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>for a very long period. Sūrya begot of her two child-
<div n="lb"/>ren, Śanaiścara and Tapatī. Besides these, Sūrya had
<div n="lb"/>another daughter named Sāvitrī also. (Chapter 47,
<div n="lb"/>Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} There was a mighty king in the Lunar
<div n="lb"/>race called Ṛkṣa in the beginning of Kṛtayuga. He
<div n="lb"/>had a son named Saṃvaraṇa. He was made king of
<div n="lb"/>his country by his father even while he was a boy.
<div n="lb"/>He was a pious and righteous man. Vasiṣṭha was his
<div n="lb"/>Guru and he taught Saṃvaraṇa the Vedas along with
<div n="lb"/>the Aṅgas.
<div n="NI"/>Once Saṃvaraṇa entrusting the administration of the
<div n="lb"/>state to Vasiṣṭha went to do penance in the forests. On
<div n="lb"/>his way he followed a deer for a long distance on horse-
<div n="lb"/>back and reached a deep forest named Vaibhrāja
<div n="lb"/>alone. There he saw a lotus pond full of blossomed
<div n="lb"/>lotuses and Kalhāra flowers. Celestial maidens were
<div n="lb"/>playing there without interruption. Among them he
<div n="lb"/>saw a very beautiful maiden. She was Tapatī daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter of Sūrya. Even at first sight they became lovers.
<div n="lb"/>The king looking at her lost his balance and fell from
<div n="lb"/>the horse. At once great and charming Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>approached the king and sprinkling water on his face
<div n="lb"/>brought him back from swoon. Tapatī was also upset
<div n="lb"/>and the other nymphs took her to her father's house
<div n="lb"/>and consoled her.
<div n="NI"/>Saṃvaraṇa returned on horse-back to his residence
<div n="lb"/>the city of Pratiṣṭhā. But the king neither slept nor ate
<div n="lb"/>any food. The sage Vasiṣṭha knew that all the ail-
<div n="lb"/>ments of the king were due to his love for Tapatī,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Sūrya. So he flew up by his yogic powers
<div n="lb"/>and met Sūrya sitting in his chariot in all splendour.
<div n="lb"/>The sage described to Sūrya the love affair between
<div n="lb"/>Saṃvaraṇa and Tapatī and pleaded on behalf of the
<div n="lb"/>king for giving Tapatī to Saṃvaraṇa. Sūrya was
<div n="lb"/>pleased to hear that and sent Tapatī along with
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha to Saṃvaraṇa. Before long the marriage of
<div n="lb"/>Tapatī with Saṃvaraṇa was celebrated solemnly at
<div n="lb"/>Pratiṣṭhānagara. The celebrated emperor Kuru was
<div n="lb"/>the son born to Tapatī of Saṃvaraṇa. (Chapter 21,
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%How she got that name.%} Because she was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Sūrya who makes the sky hot (tapa) by
<div n="lb"/>his brilliance, she was called Tapatī. (Śloka 6, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>171, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Tapatī becomes river Narmadā.%} Śūrya, father of
<div n="lb"/>Tapatī, blessed her and said she would thereafter
<div n="lb"/>flow west from the Vindhya as a river named Narmadā.
<div n="lb"/>The present holy river Narmadā is but Tapatīdevī
<div n="lb"/>transformed. (Chapter 47, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
