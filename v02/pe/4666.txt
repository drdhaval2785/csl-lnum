NAGARA¦. In ancient days there were rules and prin-
<div n="lb"/>ciples regulating the construction of a city. The name
<div n="lb"/>‘city’ could be applied to them only if they conformed
<div n="lb"/>to the rules and principles in vogue. The principles
<div n="lb"/>and rules of the erection of a proper city are given
<div n="lb"/>below:—
<div n="NI"/>One yojana or a half of land should be selected as
<div n="lb"/>site.
<F>1) A yojana is approximately twelve Kilometres.</F> The planning of the city should be commenced
<div n="lb"/>after worshipping the deity of Vāstu. There should be
<div n="lb"/>four main gates on the four sides, East, West, North
<div n="lb"/>and South. The South gate should be in the position of
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvapada, West gate in the place of Varuṇa, the
<div n="lb"/>North gate in the place of Soma (Moon) and the East
<div n="lb"/>fort gate in the place of Sūryapada (the position of the
<div n="lb"/>Sun). The haṭṭas (minor gates) should be wide enough
<div n="lb"/>for elephants etc. to pass through. The main gates
<div n="lb"/>should be six rods wide.
<div n="NI"/>When the city is completed goldsmiths should be
<div n="lb"/>settled in the Agni corner
<F>2) To know the corners see under Aṣṭadikpālakas.</F> (i. e. South East). The
<div n="lb"/>courtesans who live by dancing etc. should have their
<div n="lb"/>houses on the south side of the city. The houses of
[Page514-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>actors, those who extract oil, fishermen etc. should be
<div n="lb"/>in the corner of Nirṛti (South West). Sheds for chariots,
<div n="lb"/>weapons, swords etc. should be on the western side.
<div n="lb"/>Dealers in liquor, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons etc.
<div n="lb"/>and servants should be given houses in the Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>corner i.e. North West. The houses of Brahmins, hermits,
<div n="lb"/>sages, saints, and such others should be on the north
<div n="lb"/>side. In the Īśāna corner (North East) merchants of
<div n="lb"/>vegetables and on the eastern side, the authorities of
<div n="lb"/>the army should have their houses.
<div n="NI"/>The army (Infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants)
<div n="lb"/>should be put up in the Agni corner. On the south the
<div n="lb"/>goddesses who are protectors of women-folk should be
<div n="lb"/>consecrated. Archers should live in the Nirṛti corner.
<div n="lb"/>Most honourable people, Treasury officers, Leaders of
<div n="lb"/>the people, Brahmin groups and such others should
<div n="lb"/>have their abodes on the western side. So also Kṣatri-
<div n="lb"/>yas should have their houses on the eastern side,
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśyas on the south and Śūdras on the west of the
<div n="lb"/>city. Vaiśyas and horses should be placed on all four
<div n="lb"/>sides. The army also should be placed thus. The
<div n="lb"/>movable wealth should be placed on the east side
<div n="lb"/>and the funeral place on the south. The cattle
<div n="lb"/>etc. should be kept on the west, farmers on the
<div n="lb"/>north, and the outcastes on the corners. This
<div n="lb"/>should be the plan of a city as well as that of
<div n="lb"/>villages too.
<div n="NI"/>On the east fort-gate of cities and villages Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Bhagavatī should be consecrated. They will
<div n="lb"/>confer prosperity upon those who visit them. Temples
<div n="lb"/>dedicated to Gods should be erected on the western
<div n="lb"/>side facing the east. If temples are erected on the east
<div n="lb"/>they should face the west and those erected on the
<div n="lb"/>south should face the North. For the protection of the
<div n="lb"/>city, there should be temples dedicated to Indra, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and such other Gods. If there is no worshipping place
<div n="lb"/>in a city, a village, a fort, or a house, such places will
<div n="lb"/>be haunted by devils and troubled by diseases etc. If
<div n="lb"/>cities are built according to this plan they will afford
<div n="lb"/>both salvation and prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>On the east there should be the house of Lakṣmī, in
<div n="lb"/>the Agni corner, the kitchen on the south, bedrooms
<div n="lb"/>in the Nirṛti corner the weapon-house, on the west
<div n="lb"/>the dining hall, in the Vāyu corner, the granary, on
<div n="lb"/>the north, the treasury, and the place of worship in
<div n="lb"/>the Īśāna corner.
<div n="NI"/>Houses could be erected with four blocks, three blocks
<div n="lb"/>or only one block. Houses with four blocks could be
<div n="lb"/>made in two hundred and fiftyfive ways by making
<div n="lb"/>changes in each block and the open verandas. Houses
<div n="lb"/>with three blocks are of four types; with two blocks
<div n="lb"/>are of five types; and houses of only one block are of
<div n="lb"/>four types. There are houses and cities with twenty-
<div n="lb"/>eight open verandas. There are fiftyfive types of
<div n="lb"/>houses with four open verandas and seven open
<div n="lb"/>verandas. Houses with six open verandas and eight
<div n="lb"/>open verandas are of twenty types. In cities houses
<div n="lb"/>should have eight open verandas (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 105).
