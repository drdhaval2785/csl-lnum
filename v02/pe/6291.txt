SĀRASVATA II¦. An ancient hermit. It is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 51, Verse 7,
<div n="lb"/>that Sārasvata was the son of Dadhīca. Dadhīca once
<div n="lb"/>happened to see the celestial maid Alambuṣā and
<div n="lb"/>became excited, and seminal discharge occurred to him.
<div n="lb"/>The semen fell in the river Sarasvatī. The river became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant and delivered a child. This child grew up
<div n="lb"/>and became the famous hermit named Sārasvata.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of the hermit Dadhīci, due to scarcity
<div n="lb"/>of rain a great famine occurred which lasted for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years. When the famine became unbearable all the
<div n="lb"/>hermits on the basin and banks of the river Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>began to migrate to other places leaving all their
<div n="lb"/>possessions behind, to save their lives. But Sārasvata
<div n="lb"/>alone remained on the banks of Sarasvatī, living on
<div n="lb"/>fish obtained from the river, engaged in meditation
<div n="lb"/>and study of Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>After twelve years the famine ended and the country
<div n="lb"/>became prosperous as before. The hermits who had gone
<div n="lb"/>to other places began to come back to their hermitages.
<div n="lb"/>The desire to study Vedas grew up in their minds.
<div n="lb"/>But there was not a single person, well-versed in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas, except Sārasvata. So all the hermits accepted
<div n="lb"/>him as their teacher. Thus Sārasvata taught the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>to Sixtythousand hermits, who had returned to their
<div n="lb"/>hermitages. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 50).
<div n="NI"/>In course of time the place where the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Sārasvata stood, became famous under the name
<div n="lb"/>Sārasvata tīrtha. Tuṅgakāraṇya is another name of
<div n="lb"/>this place. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Verses
<div n="lb"/>43-50).
<div n="NI"/>In ancient days there were two schemes of study known
<div n="lb"/>as ‘Kāṇḍānukramapāṭha’ and ‘Sārasvatapāṭha’ for the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya-collection (Saṃhitā). But today the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍānukramapāṭha has become quite extinct. The
<div n="lb"/>following is a description, given in Śaṃskāraratnamālā
<div n="lb"/>stating how the ‘Sārasvatapāṭha’ attained so vigorous a
<div n="lb"/>vogue.
<div n="NI"/>Once owing to the curse of the hermit Durvāsas, the
<div n="lb"/>river Sarasvatī took birth as a woman in the house of
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin, who belonged to the Gotra of Ātreya.
<div n="lb"/>Later from that same Brahmin she conceived and gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a son named Sārasvata. The river Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>herself, taught her son the Vedas completely, and then
[Page695-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>sent him to Kurukṣetra to do penance. As a result
<div n="lb"/>of the penance Sārasvata got an original Kramapāṭha
<div n="lb"/>(serial lessons) of the Taittirīya saṃhitā. He taught
<div n="lb"/>those serial lessons to his disciples. In course of time
<div n="lb"/>these serial lessons got the name Sārasvatapāṭha.
<div n="lb"/>which earned metaphysical and philosophical import-
<div n="lb"/>ance.
