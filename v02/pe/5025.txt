PARĀŚARA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>-Vasiṣṭha—Śakti—Parāśara.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śakti, son of Vasiṣṭha begot of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Adṛṣyantī the son named Parāśara. Even at the time of
<div n="lb"/>his birth he was a scholar. (For details regarding birth
<div n="lb"/>see under Adṛśyanṭī).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Rākṣasayāga.%} Even before the birth of Parāśara,
<div n="lb"/>Kalmāṣapāda in his demoniacal form ate his father,
<div n="lb"/>Śakti. Therefore Parāśara nurtured an obstinate hatred
<div n="lb"/>against the Rākṣasas. So he performed a Yāga to kill
<div n="lb"/>all the rākṣasas. Thousands of rākṣasas were burnt to
<div n="lb"/>death at this yāga and Vasiṣṭha, grandfather of
<div n="lb"/>Parāśara felt sorry for the innocent rākṣasas. He
<div n="lb"/>approached Parāśara and said “Son, do not give way
<div n="lb"/>to such anger. Abandon this wrath. What harm have
<div n="lb"/>these poor rākṣasas done? Death was in the destiny of
<div n="lb"/>your father. Every one has to suffer the result of his
<div n="lb"/>own deeds. Anger destroys the fame and austerity which
<div n="lb"/>one has attained by years of toil. Therefore abandon
<div n="lb"/>your anger and wind up your Yāga.”
<div n="NI"/>Parāśara accepted the advice of his grandfather.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha was pleased with his grandson and at that
<div n="lb"/>time Pulastyamaharṣi son of Brahmā also came there.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha gave arghya (water and flowers) and received
<div n="lb"/>him. Then Vasiṣṭha and Pulastya jointly blessed him
<div n="lb"/>and said he would be the author of Purāṇasaṃhitā.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Parāśara became the best of the Guruparamparā
<div n="lb"/>(traditional line of preceptors). (Chapter 1, Aṃśa 1,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Vyāsa.%} Parāśara begot a son of a fisher-
<div n="lb"/>woman named Satyavatī and the boy became later the
<div n="lb"/>celebrated Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) He got the name Parāśara because even from the
<div n="lb"/>womb of his mother he consoled Vasiṣṭha when his son
<div n="lb"/>Śakti, father of Parāśara was eaten by the demoniac
<div n="lb"/>form of Kalmāṣapāda.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) See under Guruparamparā the status of Parāśara in
<div n="lb"/>that traditional line of Gurus.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Among the Sūktas, Sūkta 65, Anuvāka 12, Maṇḍala
<div n="lb"/>1 of Ṛgveda was sung by Parāśara.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Parāśara was one among the several sages who
<div n="lb"/>visited Bhīṣma lying on his bed of arrows. (Chapter 47,
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Parāśara visited king Janaka and talked with
<div n="lb"/>him on Ādhyātmika topics (spiritual matters). (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>290, Śānti Parva).
[Page568-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Chapter 150 of Anuśāsana Parva mentions Parāśara
<div n="lb"/>as describing the power of Sāvitrīmantra to an
<div n="lb"/>audience.
