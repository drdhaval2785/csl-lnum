VARAMAṆI¦. A beetle made of jewel. Brahmā had
<div n="lb"/>given a boon that only he who fought with this jewel-
<div n="lb"/>beetle in his mouth could kill Pātāla Rāvaṇa. This
[Page827-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>secret was known only to the giants, such as Rāvaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>and others. This Varamaṇi was kept in an under-
<div n="lb"/>ground cell of a harem near the Kālī temple in the
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>The battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa was going on.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān made a fort coiling his tail like a spring and
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa stayed inside this fort. While they
<div n="lb"/>were sleeping, Pātāla Rāvaṇa made a tunnel under the
<div n="lb"/>earth and carried away Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>knew this, only next day morning. Instantly he sent
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān to Pātāla. In accordance with the advice of
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣana, Hanūmān went directly to the cell in the
<div n="lb"/>harem, took Varamaṇi and put it in his mouth. Then
<div n="lb"/>he fought with Pātāla Rāvaṇa and defeated him. Thus
<div n="lb"/>with the help of the Varamaṇi Hanūmān rescued Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
