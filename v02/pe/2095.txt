DIVODĀSA¦. (ATITHIGVA). A king of Kāśī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu descended in the following
<div n="lb"/>order:—Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-
<div n="lb"/>Āyus-Anenas-Pratikṣatra-Sṛñjaya-Jaya-Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>Kṛti-Haryaśva-Sahadeva-Nadina-Jayatsena-Saṃkṛti-
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatradharmā-Śuhotra-Śala-Ārṣṭiṣeṇa-Kāśa-Dīrgha-
<div n="lb"/>tapas-Dhanvantari-Ketumān-Bhīmaratha-
<div n="lb"/>Divodāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Divodāsa's great grandfather's father, Kāśa had many
<div n="lb"/>sons. They were called the Kāśis. It was from Kāśa's
<div n="lb"/>reign that Vārāṇasī came to be called Kāśī. (Hari
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśa, Chapter 29).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Divodāsa's Reign.%} When Divodāsa began his rule in
<div n="lb"/>Vārāṇasī, there was a Rākṣasa named Kṣemaka.
<div n="lb"/>Divodāsa killed him and extended his kingdom. At
<div n="lb"/>that stage, Bhadraśreṇya, King of Hehayas invaded
<div n="lb"/>Divodāsa. Divodāsa killed the hundred sons of Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>śreṇya. At that time the sage Kuṃbhaka (Nikumbha)
<div n="lb"/>came to Kāśī. His practice was to live fora thousand
<div n="lb"/>years at any place where he reached at the time of
<div n="lb"/>dusk. Since he had reached Vārāṇasī at dusk, he set up
<div n="lb"/>an āśrama and lived there for a thousand years. At
<div n="lb"/>that time there was a famine in Vārāṇasī. The whole
<div n="lb"/>land was in the grip of a severe drought. Kumbhaka's
<div n="lb"/>āśrama and its surroundings alone remained green and
<div n="lb"/>cool. Herdsmen used to take cattle to graze in the
<div n="lb"/>neighbourhood of the āśrama. Once when they retur-
<div n="lb"/>ned in the evening, they took with their cows, the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial cow of Kumbhaka. It was dark and the sage
<div n="lb"/>searched for the cow everywhere but could not trace
<div n="lb"/>its whereabouts At last he came to know by intuition
<div n="lb"/>that his cow was taken away by the herdsmen. In his
<div n="lb"/>rage he cursed that Vārāṇasī should be ruined and left
<div n="lb"/>the place with his disciples. (See under Kumbhaka).
<div n="NI"/>The story of the ruin of Vārāṇasī in Harivaṃsa is diff-
<div n="lb"/>erent. It was the time when Śiva had married Pārvatī,
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Himavān. After marriage Śiva shifted
<div n="lb"/>his residence to his wife's house. Śiva whose task was
<div n="lb"/>to look after the affairs of the world, was never availa-
<div n="lb"/>ble for the purpose at Kailāsa, his own seat.
<div n="lb"/>The gods were in a helpless condition. They ap-
<div n="lb"/>proached Pārvatī's mother, Menā and requested her
[Page245-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to persuade Śiva to return to his own place by any
<div n="lb"/>means. Menā called her daughter and ridiculed her
<div n="lb"/>husband as a vagabond who had no place to lay his
<div n="lb"/>head on. Pārvatī could not bear this insult. Her mother's
<div n="lb"/>stinging remarks got circulation in Devaloka. So she
<div n="lb"/>urged Śiva to settle down somewhere on earth with her.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva agreed and promised to take up residence at
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī.
<div n="NI"/>The ruler of Kāśī in those days was Divodāsa. It was
<div n="lb"/>a prosperous period in the country. As a rule, man
<div n="lb"/>turns to God only when faced with misfortunes. So
<div n="lb"/>Śiva decided to bring about a famine among the people
<div n="lb"/>of the country by ruining it. For that he sent sage
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhaka to Vārāṇasī. Kumbhaka arrived in Kāśī
<div n="lb"/>and appeared to the barber Karṇaka to whom he
<div n="lb"/>communicated Śiva's intentions. The barber cheerfully
<div n="lb"/>fell in with the proposal and built a temple on the
<div n="lb"/>next day for the residence of Kumbhaka. Living in
<div n="lb"/>the temple, Kumbhaka began to participate in the
<div n="lb"/>spiritual matters of the people. His blessings were much
<div n="lb"/>sought after and people came to have deep faith in
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="NI"/>Divodāsa had no children. He had made many pious
<div n="lb"/>offerings to gods and performed many holy rites for
<div n="lb"/>removing his wife's sterility, but it was all in vain.
<div n="lb"/>At last, at the King's suggestion, she began to offer
<div n="lb"/>pūjā to Kumbhaka praying for issue. But even after
<div n="lb"/>a long period of devoted worship, she received no
<div n="lb"/>blessing or boon from the sage. Moved by the pathetic
<div n="lb"/>condition of his queen, Suyaśas, Divodāsa reproached
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhaka very severely. He reprimanded him for
<div n="lb"/>denying his blessings to the queen while he was shower-
<div n="lb"/>ing them on all and sundry in the country. Provoked
<div n="lb"/>at the King's rebuke, Kumbhaka pronounced a curse
<div n="lb"/>that the country should be ruined. As a result of it the
<div n="lb"/>country began to decline. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter 29).
<div n="NI"/>Śiva and Pārvatī came and settled down in Vārāṇasī.
<div n="lb"/>After some years, Pārvatī began to press her husband
<div n="lb"/>to leave the place and to go somewhere else. Śiva was
<div n="lb"/>not inclined to do so. He said the place was “Avimu-
<div n="lb"/>kta” and therefore insisted that he would not leave
<div n="lb"/>it. From that time the place came to be called
<div n="lb"/>“Avimukta.”
<div n="NI"/>3) Other details.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Towards the end of his life Divodāsa became a
<div n="lb"/>Rājarṣi (Royal Saint). There are numerous references
<div n="lb"/>to this Rājarṣi in the Ṛgveda. Since Divodāsa was of
<div n="lb"/>a very hospitable nature he was known by another
<div n="lb"/>name, “Atithigva”. In Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th
<div n="lb"/>Anuvāka, 127th Sūkta, we read that once he hid him-
<div n="lb"/>self under water to escape from an Asura called
<div n="lb"/>Śaṃbara.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Divodāsa had a son named “Parucchepa”, who
<div n="lb"/>was a Ṛṣi. Ṛgveda 1st Maṇḍala 19th Anuvāka, 127th
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta relates to Parucchepa.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Bhīmaratha, the father of Divodāsa, had two other
<div n="lb"/>names, Bhīmasena, and Sudeva. Divodāsa purchased
<div n="lb"/>Mādhavī, the daughter of Yayāti after paying two
<div n="lb"/>hundred Śyāmakarṇāśvas (beautiful horses with dark-
<div n="lb"/>coloured ears) to Gālava, so that he might have chil-
<div n="lb"/>dren. After the birth of his children, he returned
<div n="lb"/>Mādhavī to her father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>117).
<div n="NI"/>(4) He sits in Yama's assembly and offers Pūjā to
<div n="lb"/>Yama. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 12).
[Page246-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(5) Divodāsa once plundered the accessories of his
<div n="lb"/>enemies. Agnihotra vanished after it. (M.B. Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>(6) It was at the behest of Indra that Divodāsa built
<div n="lb"/>the city of Vāraṇasī (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>30, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Once Divodāsa fought with the King of Hehaya
<div n="lb"/>for one thousand days. After having lost his army he went
<div n="lb"/>to the sage Bharadvāja and performed Putrakāmeṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. As a result of it a son Pratardana was born
<div n="lb"/>to him. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Other names for Divodāsa used in the Mahābhā-
<div n="lb"/>rata are—Bhaimaseni, Kāśīśa, Saudeva, Sudevatanaya
<div n="lb"/>etc.
<div n="NI"/>DIVYĀDEVĪ. Daughter of Divodāsa, King of Plakṣa-
<div n="lb"/>dvīpa. There is a story about this princess in Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapters 85, 88.
<div n="NI"/>Divodāsa decided to give his daughter Divyā in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to Citrasena, King of Rūpadeśa. But just
<div n="lb"/>before the day fixed for the marriage Citrasena died
<div n="lb"/>prematurely. So, as advised by the Brāhmaṇas who had
<div n="lb"/>come there she was married to Rūpasena. He also died
<div n="lb"/>soon after. She was subsequently married to 21 persons
<div n="lb"/>in turn, and all of them died one by one.
<div n="NI"/>Everyone took pity on her for her ill-fate. At last, at the
<div n="lb"/>suggestion of the ministers, preparations were made for
<div n="lb"/>her svayaṃvara. Here also ill-luck pursued her. All
<div n="lb"/>the princes who arrived to take part in the svayaṃvara
<div n="lb"/>killed each other in mutual fight. Depressed and embit-
<div n="lb"/>tered by all this, Divyā decided to renounce all worldly
<div n="lb"/>pleasures and proceeded to the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śuka named Ujjvala came to Plakṣadvīpa.
<div n="lb"/>Moved to pity at the grief-stricken Divyā he taught her
<div n="lb"/>“Aśūnyaśayana” vrata. When she practised this vrata
<div n="lb"/>with devotion for about four years, Mahāviṣṇu appeared
<div n="lb"/>before her and took her with him to Viṣṇuloka.
