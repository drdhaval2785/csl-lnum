NṚGA¦. A king born in the dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān—Vaivasvata Manu—
<div n="lb"/>Mahābāhu—Prasandhi—Kṣupa—Nṛga.
<div n="NI"/>Nṛga was the younger brother of Ikṣvāku. From Nṛga
<div n="lb"/>was born Sumati, from him the king called Jyotis, from
<div n="lb"/>Jyotis Vasu and from Vasu Pratīka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Nṛga became chameleon.%} Nṛga was an extremely
<div n="lb"/>righteous and generous King. Once, at Puṣkara he
<div n="lb"/>gifted away thousands of cows to brahmins. There was
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin called Parvata living near Puṣkara. He too
<div n="lb"/>was given a cow and it was after that the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Anārata came. By then there remained no cow
<div n="lb"/>to be gifted. Anārata came after Parvata had gone
<div n="lb"/>into the forest after leaving the cow at the pond (Puṣk-
<div n="lb"/>ara). Nṛga had forgotten the fact that the cow had
<div n="lb"/>already been gifted away to Parvata and finding it there
<div n="lb"/>owner-less he gave it to Anārata, who went away with
<div n="lb"/>the cow very much pleased. The King and his minis-
<div n="lb"/>ters also returned to the palace.
<div n="NI"/>A very short time afterwards Parvata returned to the
<div n="lb"/>pond and felt very sorry to miss his cow. He searched
<div n="lb"/>for it here and there and at last found it at Anārata's
<div n="lb"/>house. Quarrel ensued between the two, Parvata
<div n="lb"/>alleging that Anārata had stolen his cow while the
<div n="lb"/>latter contended that it had been given to him by the
<div n="lb"/>King. Now, it was decided that the question should
<div n="lb"/>be submitted for arbitration to the King, and the
<div n="lb"/>contending parties went to the capital to see the King.
<div n="lb"/>At the palace they asked the gate-keepers to tell the
<div n="lb"/>King about their arrival. But, they did not tell the
<div n="lb"/>King, nor did he come.
<div n="NI"/>Angered at this the brahmins cursed that Nṛga be
<div n="lb"/>converted into a chameleon and live as such for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. The King heard about the curse and
<div n="lb"/>ran up to the brahmins and requested for absolution
<div n="lb"/>from it. The brahmins then said that after one thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand years Mahāviṣṇu would incarnate as Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and that at his touch Nṛga, the chameleon would
<div n="lb"/>resume his former form as King. According to this
<div n="lb"/>curse Nṛga was born as a chameleon in a neglected
<div n="lb"/>well at Dvārakā. One day Sāmba and others who
<div n="lb"/>happened to go near the well tried their best to take
<div n="lb"/>the chameleon out of it, to no purpose. At last Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>with his attendants came and took it out of the well.
<div n="lb"/>At Kṛṣṇa's touch it resumed its form as King Nṛga,
<div n="lb"/>and related the story of his curse to the onlookers,
<div n="lb"/>who stood there wondering.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) After his death Nṛga lived in Yama's court wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipping him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Nṛga once conducted a yajña on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river Payoṣṇī in Varāhatīrtha at which Indra drank
<div n="lb"/>soma so much as to get intoxicated, and the brahmins
[Page544-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>danced with pleasure at the very liberal gifts made to
<div n="lb"/>them. (Vana Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Nṛga was a King very dear to Indians. (Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 7).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Kṛṣṇa granted salvation to Nṛga who changed,
<div n="lb"/>at his touch, from chameleon to his former form as
<div n="lb"/>King Nṛga. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 70, Verse 29).
<div n="NI"/>(v) He did not eat flesh. (Anuśāsana Parva. Chapter
