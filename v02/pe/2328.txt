GANDHARVANAGARA¦. Vyāsa has compared munis
<div n="lb"/>disappearing from sight to the fading out of Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>nagara.
<div n="NI"/>“After having thus spoken to the Kurus, and while
<div n="lb"/>they were looking on, the band of sages disappeared
<div n="lb"/>in a trice like the fading out of Gandharvanagara.”
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 126, Verses 35 and 36).
<div n="NI"/>What is this Gandharvanagara? The following descrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion occurs in Hindi Śabdasāgara. “Owing to different
<div n="lb"/>optical illusions (sight) of man, villages and cities may
<div n="lb"/>appear to exist in the sky and also on seas, rivers, etc.
<div n="lb"/>When during summer the air on the upper strata of
<div n="lb"/>deserts, seas etc. gets heated, expanded, and rises up,
<div n="lb"/>the light passing through it becomes multi-coloured and
<div n="lb"/>gives reflections in the sky in the form of village parts or
<div n="lb"/>cities. Also can be seen therein reflections of trees,
<div n="lb"/>boats etc. One such reflection may be cast on earth
<div n="lb"/>also. This is a mere optical illusion. This reflection
<div n="lb"/>immediately fades out also. This unreal city which is
<div n="lb"/>an optical illusion is Gandharvanagara.
