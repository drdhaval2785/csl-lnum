GĪTAVIDYĀDHARA¦. A great musician among the
<div n="lb"/>gandharvas. When he found that sage Pulastya had
<div n="lb"/>no liking for music he teased the sage by making the
<div n="lb"/>sounds of a boar. The enraged sage cursed him and
<div n="lb"/>turned him into a boar. He got relief from the curse
<div n="lb"/>when Ikṣvāku killed him and Gītavidyādhara became
<div n="lb"/>his old self again. (Chapter 46, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
