CITRAKETU I¦. An emperor, who remained childless
<div n="lb"/>for a long time. At last a son was born to him owing to
[Page184-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the blessings of Sage Aṅgiras. But, ere long the child was
<div n="lb"/>dead and gone, and its parents, immersed in sorrow
<div n="lb"/>took the dead child to Aṅgiras. Nārada also happened
<div n="lb"/>to be there on the occasion. Aṅgiras restored the dead
<div n="lb"/>child to life and asked him to live with the parents.
<div n="lb"/>The boy immediately stood up and told Aṅgiras that
<div n="lb"/>he had many parents in his many previous lives, and
<div n="lb"/>requested to be enlightened as to which of those parents
<div n="lb"/>he was to live with. Brahmā and Nārada felt confused.
<div n="lb"/>In the end they disappeared after imparting spiritual
<div n="lb"/>wisdom to Citraketu. And, Citraketu, who, for eight
<div n="lb"/>days immersed himself in concentrating the mind on
<div n="lb"/>God was turned into a Gandharva; his wife too turned
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva.
<div n="NI"/>And, both of them rose up in the sky and flying over
<div n="lb"/>Mount Kailāsa looked down to the mountain. There they
<div n="lb"/>saw Pārvatī being seated on the thighs of Śiva at which
<div n="lb"/>sight Citraketu laughed. Enraged by the laughter
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī cursed him to be born as an asura, and he was
<div n="lb"/>born as such. Vṛtrāsura was Citraketu born as asura.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Saṣṭha Skandha).
