RĀHODARA¦ (RAHODARA). A muni of ancient days.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story in Chapter 39 of the Vāmana Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>about a skull falling on the muni's neck and the place
<div n="lb"/>where the skull was removed from his neck coming to
<div n="lb"/>be known as Kapālamocana.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma killed the Rākṣasas who lived in Daṇḍaka
<div n="lb"/>forest. The head of one of the Rākṣasas cut by a very
<div n="lb"/>sharp knife was thrown off at a distance in the forest and
<div n="lb"/>it fell on the neck of Rahodara, who happened to be
<div n="lb"/>walking at the time in the forest. It (the head) cut
<div n="lb"/>deep into the bones of the Sage and that made it
<div n="lb"/>difficult for him to move about. Yet, he visited all the
<div n="lb"/>holy places on the earth with the skull of the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>around his neck. At last he told the noble Ṛṣis about
<div n="lb"/>his misfortune and they directed him to visit ‘Auśanasa-
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha,’ and the moment he touched the water in the
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha the skull fell into the water. Having been told
<div n="lb"/>about the incident, the Ṛṣis named the tīrtha ‘Kapāla-
<div n="lb"/>mocana’.
