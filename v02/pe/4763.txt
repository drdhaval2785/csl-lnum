NĀRĀYAṆA¦. One of the two Ṛṣis famous as Naranārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Dharma, son of Brahmā was Nārāyaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>father. Dharma married ten daughters of Dakṣa, and
<div n="lb"/>four sons, i.e. Hari, Kṛṣṇa, Nara and Nārāyaṇa were
<div n="lb"/>born to him of them. Of the four, Nara and Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>were inseparable sannyāsins. In the holy Badarikāśrama
<div n="lb"/>on the slopes of the Himālayas they did tapas to please
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā for a thousand years.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Nārāyaṇa's tapas.%} The whole world was, so to say,
<div n="lb"/>burnt by the intense tapas of Naranārāyaṇas. Indra
<div n="lb"/>was alarmed. Believing that their tapas was for the
<div n="lb"/>attainment of Indrahood and fearing his own displace-
<div n="lb"/>ment Indra went to Badarikāśrama mounted on Airā-
<div n="lb"/>vata to break their tapas, and told them thus: “Oh
<div n="lb"/>ascetics, who shine like the rising sun, I am pleased with
<div n="lb"/>your tapas. You may choose any boon you like.”
<div n="NI"/>The Naranārāyaṇas did not even recognise the thunder-
<div n="lb"/>like voice of Indra; nor did they answer him. This
<div n="lb"/>increased Indra's alarm, and he decided to disturb
<div n="lb"/>them with Māyā, productive of fear, desire etc. and thus
<div n="lb"/>break their tapas. Indra began threatening them
<div n="lb"/>with cruel animals created by him like wild cat, leopard
<div n="lb"/>tiger, lion, elephant etc. and also with aberrations
<div n="lb"/>created in nature like storm, rain, wild fire etc. But,
<div n="lb"/>none of the above affected or moved them in the least.
<div n="lb"/>After all, why should they be moved? You would
<div n="lb"/>threaten only those who are subject to desires, love of
<div n="lb"/>comfort, any particular object in life or likes and dis-
<div n="lb"/>likes. Since Naranārāyaṇas had none of the above, Indra's
<div n="lb"/>attempts to threaten them failed. Thus disappointed he
<div n="lb"/>returned to Svargaloka and after thinking for a long
<div n="lb"/>time he called Kāmadeva to him and spoke as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>“You should go, along with Rati and the spring, to
<div n="lb"/>Badarikāśrama. Also take with you any number of
<div n="lb"/>apsarā women you want. You will find Naranārāyaṇas
<div n="lb"/>at the āśrama performing tapas and will weaken them
<div n="lb"/>from their resolution by using your arrows (erotic shafts)
<div n="lb"/>and tempt them into erotic life. I am also deputing
<div n="lb"/>apsarā women like Rambhā to help you.”
<div n="NI"/>Kāmadeva accordingly started for Badarikāśrama
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by all the apsarā women. When they
<div n="lb"/>reached the place spring season had set in there.
<div n="NI"/>Varieties of beetles flew about from flower to flower
<div n="lb"/>humming. Trees like the mango and Palāśa were thick
<div n="lb"/>with flowers. Creepers (Comparable to young women)
<div n="lb"/>entwined and embraced trees (lovers), the former
<div n="lb"/>carrying puṣpas (flowers, in the case of young women,
<div n="lb"/>coming of age). A fragrant breeze swept the whole
<div n="lb"/>region. In this erotic background Kāma and Rati, with
<div n="lb"/>their five arrows and accompanied by celestial women
<div n="lb"/>came to the āśrama, and there they began singing and
<div n="lb"/>dancing. The erotic flow enchanted the soul of Naranā-
<div n="lb"/>rāyaṇas. Nārāyaṇarṣi awoke from his tapas and
<div n="lb"/>whispered something in the ears of Nara. By now
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva had entered the presence of Naranārāyaṇas
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by the reputed beauties of Svarloka like
<div n="lb"/>Menakā, Rambhā, Tilottamā, Sukeśinī, Manoramā,
<div n="lb"/>Maheśvarī, Puṣpagandhā, Pramadvarā, Ghṛtācī,
<div n="lb"/>Candraprabhā, Somaprabhā, Vidyunmālā, Ambujākṣī
<div n="lb"/>and Kāñcanamālā. These beauties were accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by 10080 of their beautiful attendants. Naranārāyaṇas
[Page533-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>were wonder-struck to see this army of Kāma. All those
<div n="lb"/>great beauties stood before Naranārāyaṇas in salutation.
<div n="lb"/>Some of them began to sing, others to dance and yet
<div n="lb"/>others to take up the tunes. Nārayaṇarṣi could easily
<div n="lb"/>divine the reason for the show. He thought to himself
<div n="lb"/>thus—
<div n="NI"/>“None but Devendra could have sent all these people
<div n="lb"/>here, and his object must be to hinder our tapas. But I
<div n="lb"/>shall prove to Indra that all these mean nothing to me.
<div n="lb"/>Let Devendra understand that I can create more
<div n="lb"/>beautiful ladies than these women of his here and that
<div n="lb"/>I am not in the least attracted by any of them here.”
<div n="NI"/>Thinking thus Nārāyaṇa beat gently on his thigh and
<div n="lb"/>immediately arose therefrom an exceptionally beautiful
<div n="lb"/>woman. Since that woman, the most beautiful in all the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds, was created from the Ūru (thigh) of
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa she came to be known as Urvaśī. Others were
<div n="lb"/>wonder-struck by this new creation. He created
<div n="lb"/>some other beauties also, and an equal number of
<div n="lb"/>other women to serve them. All of them stood before
<div n="lb"/>him in humble salutation.
<div n="NI"/>The celestial women almost fainted with fear. In re-
<div n="lb"/>pentance they begged the munis pardon for their
<div n="lb"/>mistake. The munis were kindly disposed towards them.
<div n="lb"/>They told them that they (munis) cherished no
<div n="lb"/>animosity towards them, but in fact were pleased with
<div n="lb"/>them, and they further asked them (celestial women)
<div n="lb"/>to choose their boons. The munis also asked them to
<div n="lb"/>take Urvaśī to Devaloka as a present from them to Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Let the Devas prosper.
<div n="NI"/>Having heard Nara speak like this the celestial women
<div n="lb"/>returned in great humility to Devaloka with Urvaśī
<div n="lb"/>and the other women. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
