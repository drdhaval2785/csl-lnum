COLA¦. A very righteous emperor of Kāñcīpura. Be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of the virtuous rule of this emperor his country
<div n="lb"/>got the name Cola. There is an interesting story in
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa of how the emperor attained Vaikuṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhaloka (The abode of Mahāviṣṇu).
<div n="NI"/>Once Cola went to Vaikuṇṭha to worship Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>As he was worshipping him with pearls and flowers
<div n="lb"/>of gold a brahmin subject of his came there to worship
<div n="lb"/>him with water and Tulasī leaves. The simple offer-
<div n="lb"/>ing of Tulasī leaves and flowers by this brahmaṛṣi, Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa, eclipsed the expensive one by the King and the
<div n="lb"/>latter was greatly offended and he rebuked the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>saying that he was a poor man who did not know what
<div n="lb"/>devotion to Viṣṇu was. But Viṣṇudāsa did not take
<div n="lb"/>the taunt unchallenged. He asked the king to wait
<div n="lb"/>and see who would merge with the glowing entity of
<div n="lb"/>the Lord earlier.
<div n="NI"/>The King on returning to his palace started a Vaiṣṇava-
<div n="lb"/>sattra. (An almonry dedicated to Mahāviṣṇu). This
<div n="lb"/>almshouse was as comfortable and luxurious as the
<div n="lb"/>one once started by Brahmā in the temple of Gaya.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇudāsa on the other hand spent his life in a Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>temple leading a celibate life and observing rites pleas-
<div n="lb"/>ing to Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>One day after finishing his daily morning rites Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa cooked his food as usual and kept it in its place
<div n="lb"/>to be taken later. But on returning to it after some
<div n="lb"/>time he found his food eaten by someone else. He
<div n="lb"/>went without food that day and it happened the next
<div n="lb"/>day also. It continued to happen thus for a week and
<div n="lb"/>all these days Viṣṇudāsa went fasting. Viṣṇudāsa
<div n="lb"/>then decided to watch and see who the thief was.
<div n="lb"/>On keeping a vigil he found a Caṇḍāla (a harijan of
<div n="lb"/>the lowest Cadre) timidly coming and grabbing at
<div n="lb"/>the food with gluttonous greed to appease his hunger.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the famished skeletonous body of the thief Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa felt compassion rather than resentment and calling
<div n="lb"/>him back to take the food went after him crying “Hi,
<div n="lb"/>come here and take this ghee also with you. That food
<div n="lb"/>has no fat in it.” But the Gaṇḍāla frightened at the
<div n="lb"/>sight of the owner of the food ran away as fast as his
<div n="lb"/>legs could carry him, Viṣṇudāsa following him. But
<div n="lb"/>soon the Caṇḍāla fell fainting on the road exhausted and
<div n="lb"/>tired. Viṣṇudāsa reaching his side started fanning him
<div n="lb"/>with his cloth. Very soon the Caṇḍāla changed
<div n="lb"/>himself into Mahāviṣṇu adorned with Śaṃkha, Cakra
<div n="lb"/>and Gadā and Viṣṇu embracing his devotee took him
<div n="lb"/>to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Cola called Mudgala the priest of the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavasattra, to his side and lamented “I started
<div n="lb"/>this sattra to spite Viṣṇudāsa and now he has gone to
[Page189-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. It was due to his true devotion to God
<div n="lb"/>that he has attained salvation. What we have done
<div n="lb"/>is of no use.” So saying he crowned his nephew as
<div n="lb"/>King. Even while young he had become an ascetic and as
<div n="lb"/>such had no sons. From that time the crowning of
<div n="lb"/>the nephew as King became a precedent in Cola.
<div n="lb"/>Renouncing the kingdom Cola went to the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>hall and circling the sacrificial fire stood before it and
<div n="lb"/>addressing Mukunda said “Oh Viṣṇu, grant me un-
<div n="lb"/>wavering devotion to you in thought, speech and deed.”
<div n="lb"/>Repeating this three times the king jumped into the
<div n="lb"/>fire. At this Mudgala, the priest, burst into anger and
<div n="lb"/>tore off the lock of hair on his head. So even today
<div n="lb"/>the descendants of Mudgala do not have hair-locks.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu who is always affectionate to his devotees graci-
<div n="lb"/>ously appeared from the sacrificial fire and embraced
<div n="lb"/>the King. The King was then taken to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 110, 111, Padma Purāṇa).
