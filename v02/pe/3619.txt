KRAUÑCA II¦. A mountain. There is a story about this
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Long ago there lived an Asura named
<div n="lb"/>Krauñca. He was leading a wicked life and was
<div n="lb"/>haughty and arrogant. Once Agastya went to Kailāsa
<div n="lb"/>and worshipped Śiva. Kāverīdevī also was standing
<div n="lb"/>close by, worshipping Śiva. God Śiva appeared before
<div n="lb"/>Agastya and told him that he might ask for any boon.
<div n="lb"/>He requested for the power to push down Vindhya by
<div n="lb"/>kicking and to establish a holy Tīrtha (bath) on the
<div n="lb"/>earth. Śiva granted the boons. For making the tīrtha
<div n="lb"/>Śiva turned Kāverī into a river and placed her in the
<div n="lb"/>water-pot of Agastya. As Agastya was returning from
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa with Kāverī in his water-pot, Krauñca the
<div n="lb"/>Asura took the shape of a mountain and hindered his
<div n="lb"/>way. The Asura caused a heavy rain too. Agastya
<div n="lb"/>wandered through the forest without finding the path
<div n="lb"/>for days. At last he realized the cause. He took a few
<div n="lb"/>drops of water from his waterpot and with chanting of
<div n="lb"/>Mantras and meditation threw the drops at the Asura
<div n="lb"/>with the curse that he would stand there for ever as a
<div n="lb"/>mountain. He said that he would be liberated from the
<div n="lb"/>curse when pierced by the arrow of Subrahmaṇya, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Śiva. From that day onwards Krauñca the Asura
<div n="lb"/>had been standing there as a mountain. That mountain
<div n="lb"/>was called ‘The mountain of Krauñca.’ (Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>There is another statement in Harivaṃśa, Chapter 18,
<div n="lb"/>that the mountain Krauñca was the son of the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain Maināka, the son of Menā.
<div n="NI"/>Subrahmaṇya fought a terrible battle with the Asuras.
<div n="lb"/>Many died. Bāṇāsura, the son of Mahābali, fled from
<div n="lb"/>the battlefield and hid himself inside the mountain
<div n="lb"/>Krauñca. Subrahmaṇya cleft the mountain into two
<div n="lb"/>with the arrow given by Agni (Fire-god). Thus
<div n="lb"/>Krauñcāsura was liberated from the curse. (M.B. Śalya
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 46).
<div n="NI"/>In ‘Meghadūta’ Kālidāsa mentions about the cleavage
<div n="lb"/>in the mountain Krauñca. In Mahābhārata, Vana
[Page417-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 225, Stanza 33, mention is made that
<div n="lb"/>through this cleavage swans and vultures fly to Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru. (For the story of how Paraśurāma cleft the
<div n="lb"/>Krauñca mountain see under Paraśurāma).
