TAMAS II¦. One of the three qualities of the soul. Sattva,
<div n="lb"/>Rajas and Tamas are the three qualities. It is through
[Page785-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the union of these three qualities that the inner soul
<div n="lb"/>enters the life of all animate and inanimate objects. The
<div n="lb"/>attributes of Tamas are greed, sleep, bravery, cruelty
<div n="lb"/>disbelief in god, bad habits, begging and indifference.
<div n="lb"/>It is because of the action of tamoguṇa that one be-
<div n="lb"/>comes a prey to lust. It is the worst result of tāmasic
<div n="lb"/>activities that people are born as inanimate objects,
<div n="lb"/>worms, insects, fishes, serpents, tortoises, cows and deer.
<div n="lb"/>As a better result of Tāmasic activities people are born
<div n="lb"/>as elephants, horses, Śūdras, barbarous people, lions,
<div n="lb"/>tigers and hogs. It is the good result of tāmasic deeds
<div n="lb"/>that produce pilgrims, good castes, egoistic people,
<div n="lb"/>demons and devils. (Chapter 2, Manusmṛti).
