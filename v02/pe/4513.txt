MEKHALA¦ (MEKALA). Mekhala was a country which had
<div n="lb"/>attained Purāṇic fame in ancient India. The inhabitants
<div n="lb"/>of this place were called Mekhalas. They were the body-
<div n="lb"/>guards of Bhīṣma. (Chapter 51, Bhīṣma Parva). They
<div n="lb"/>formed a separate division in the army of Bṛhannala,
<div n="lb"/>King of Kosala. (Chapter 87, Bhīṣma Parva). Once
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa conquered this country. (Śloka 8, Chapter 4,

<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva).
