<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} In both Hindu and Christian scriptures,
<div n="lb"/>the story about the origin of woman appears to be
<div n="lb"/>similar. It is stated in Manusmṛti, Chapter 1, Verse
<div n="lb"/>32, that Brahmā divided his body into two and made
<div n="lb"/>one part male and the other part female and the male
<div n="lb"/>embraced the female, from which union was born the
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭpuruṣa.

<div n="NI"/>In the book of Genesis in the Bible, the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>first woman is given. It is somewhat similar to the one
<div n="lb"/>given above. God created Adam as the first man. God
<div n="lb"/>caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. Then he took
<div n="lb"/>a rib from Adam, made a woman with it, and gave
<div n="lb"/>that woman, who was called Eve, to Adam as wife.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Fascination.%} A story as given below occurs in Devī
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, which states how woman acquired fascination.
<div n="lb"/>Once Indra prohibited Aśvinīdevas from drinking the
<div n="lb"/>liquor called Soma. They complained to the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana, who agreed to recover for them the lost
<div n="lb"/>right, for which purpose he began a sacrifice. Indra
<div n="lb"/>caused obstruction to the sacrifice. Instantly by the
<div n="lb"/>power of Cyavana, an asura named Mada rose up from
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial fire. Finally Indra begged the hermit for
<div n="lb"/>pardon. Cyavana divided the asura into four parts
<div n="lb"/>and placed one portion in gambling, one portion in
<div n="lb"/>hunting, the third portion in liquor and the fourth
<div n="lb"/>part in woman. Thenceforward woman began to have
<div n="lb"/>fascination.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Manu, about women.%} The following is the place in
<div n="lb"/>society of women in ancient days, according to Manu.
<div n="lb"/>Husband or relatives should give women no freedom.
<div n="lb"/>Even if they became immoral, they should be kept
<div n="lb"/>under the control of men. As woman has to be under
<div n="lb"/>the protection of father in childhood, under the pro-
<div n="lb"/>tection of husband in youth and under the protection of
<div n="lb"/>son in old age, she does not deserve freedom at any time.
<Poem>“Pitā rakṣati kaumāre
<div n="lb"/>Bhartā rakṣati yauvane /
<div n="lb"/>Rakṣanti sthāvire putrāḥ
<div n="lb"/>Na strī svātantryamarhati.”</Poem>
[Page744-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>The father who does not give his daughter to a suitable
<div n="lb"/>husband before she attains puberty, the husband who
<div n="lb"/>does not engage in coition with his wife after puberty,
<div n="lb"/>and the son who does not support his mother after the
<div n="lb"/>death of her husband, are men of mean character.
<div n="lb"/>(Manusmṛti, Chapter 9).
