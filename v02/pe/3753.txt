KUBERATĪRTHA¦. A holy place on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river Sarasvatī. Once the Devas appeared to Kubera at
<div n="lb"/>this tīrtha and granted him overlordship of wealth,
<div n="lb"/>friendship of Śiva, Deva-hood and rulership of the
<div n="lb"/>world. The Marudgaṇas crowned him King. He got
<div n="lb"/>the son Nalakūbara also there. The place, thus
<div n="lb"/>important in many ways came to be reputed as Kubera-
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha in later years. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 97).
