KHAṆḌAPARAŚU¦. Śiva. A story occurs in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata stating how Śiva got this name. The famous
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa-yāga (sacrifice performed by Dakṣa) was perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed at a time when the Nara Nārāyaṇas were engaged in
<div n="lb"/>penance in Badaryāśrama. Dakṣa did not invite his son-
<div n="lb"/>in-law Śiva. The angry Śiva sent his trident against
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa. The trident destroyed the sacrifice of Dakṣa and
<div n="lb"/>then flew against the breast of Nārāyaṇa who was
<div n="lb"/>sitting in penance in Badaryāśrama. By the power of
<div n="lb"/>the trident the hair of Nārāyaṇa became of muñja (a
<div n="lb"/>grass) colour. From that day onwards Nārāyaṇa came
<div n="lb"/>to be known by the name Muñjakeśa. By a sound
<div n="lb"/>“hum”, the hermit Nārāyaṇa deviated the trident,
<div n="lb"/>which reached the hands of Śiva, who got angry and
<div n="lb"/>approached Nārāyaṇa to kill him. Nara, who was close
<div n="lb"/>by took an arrow and reciting spells over it, released it
<div n="lb"/>to kill Śiva. Immediately the arrow changed to an axe.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva broke the axe. After this the axe became the
<div n="lb"/>weapon of Śiva. In Mahābhārata Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>49, Stanza 33, it is mentioned that this axe was given
<div n="lb"/>to Paraśurāma the disciple of Śiva. Thenceforward
<div n="lb"/>Śiva got the name Khaṇḍaparaśu. (Paraśu means
<div n="lb"/>axe). (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 343. Stan-
<div n="lb"/>zas 150-59, 167).
