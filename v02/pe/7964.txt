VĀLMĪKI I¦. A hermit who was the first among poets
<div n="lb"/>and the author of Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Knowledge about this hermit
<div n="lb"/>who was the first among the poets of Bhārata, is scanty.
<div n="lb"/>So we have to depend mainly on some hearsay for the
<div n="lb"/>life history of this sage.
<div n="NI"/>It is said that Vālmīki was the tenth son of Varuṇa. But
<div n="lb"/>in his younger age he fell into the hands of wicked
<div n="lb"/>people and became a wicked man, like his friends. Then
<div n="lb"/>his name was not Vālmīki. Being a father, he had to
<div n="lb"/>support his family. For this purpose he used to plunder
<div n="lb"/>travellers. Once he happened to catch the Saptarṣis
<div n="lb"/>(the seven hermits) who passed by that way. The
<div n="lb"/>hermits asked him whether his wife and children would
<div n="lb"/>share the sins he had incurred by plundering. The
<div n="lb"/>plunderer could not answer that unexpected question.
<div n="lb"/>He ran home and asked his wife and children if they
<div n="lb"/>would share the sins incurred by him. They were not
<div n="lb"/>prepared to do so. In a moment his life underwent a
<div n="lb"/>thorough change. He ran to the Saptarṣis and knelt
<div n="lb"/>before them. They imparted to the forester, knowledge
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedas. The forester sat under a tree and began
<div n="lb"/>to sing ‘Rāma Rāma.’ Days and months and years
<div n="lb"/>passed, unknown to him. He did not know that white
<div n="lb"/>ants had built a shelter above him. After several years
<div n="lb"/>the Saptarṣis returned by that way. They broke the
[Page823-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ant-hill and took the hermit out. Because he came out
<div n="lb"/>of Valmīka or white-ant-hill he came to be known as
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki. He built his hermitage on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river Tamasā and lived there with his disciples. It was
<div n="lb"/>at this place that he composed the famous poem Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa. (For further details see under Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Vālmīki shines in the palace of Indra. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 16).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 83, Stanza 27, that Vālmīki met Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>who was going to Hastināpura as a messenger of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Sātyaki recited a poem composed by Vālmīki,
<div n="lb"/>after having killed Bhūriśravas in the Bhārata-battle.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 143, Stanza 57).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Vālmīki told Yudhiṣṭhira of the benefits of his
<div n="lb"/>devotion to Śiva. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>18, Stanza 8).
