INDĪVARĀKṢA¦. A Gandharva. He was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Nalanābha, the chief of the Vidyādharas. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story about this Gandharva in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 60:—
<div n="NI"/>Indīvarākṣa went to the sage Brahmamitra to learn
<div n="lb"/>Āyurveda. For some unknown reason, the sage did not
<div n="lb"/>teach him. Indīvarākṣa decided to learn by overhearing
<div n="lb"/>what the guru taught the other pupils from a hiding
<div n="lb"/>place. In six months’ time he learnt Āyurveda. Over-
<div n="lb"/>joyed at the thought that he was able to acquire as
<div n="lb"/>much learning in this science as the other pupils, with-
<div n="lb"/>in such a short time, and oblivious of his surroundings,
<div n="lb"/>he laughed loudly. The guru who understood the secret,
<div n="lb"/>uttered a curse that he would become a Rākṣasa within
<div n="lb"/>seven days. The repentant Indīvarākṣa begged for his
<div n="lb"/>pardon. Then the sage told him that he would be
<div n="lb"/>restored to his own form and give up the Rākṣasa shape
<div n="lb"/>when he was shot with arrows by his own children.
<div n="NI"/>Once when he approached his daughter Manoramā
<div n="lb"/>to devour her, his son-in law, Svarocis who had learnt
<div n="lb"/>the science of archery from that girl, defeated him. In
<div n="lb"/>this way, Indīvarākṣa got his own former form. After
<div n="lb"/>that he taught Svarocis, the sciences of archery which
<div n="lb"/>he had learnt from his own daughter and also from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmamitra.
