DĪRGHATAMAS¦. A great Muni.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Aṅgiras, the son of Brahmā, had two sons,
<div n="lb"/>Utathya and Bṛhaspati. One day when Utathya was
<div n="lb"/>away from home, Bṛhaspati approached his elder
<div n="lb"/>brother's wife, Mamatā, who was pregnant at the time,
<div n="lb"/>and tried to have sexual union with her. But she tried
<div n="lb"/>to dissuade him and said—“The child in my womb,
<div n="lb"/>born from Utathya's semen has already mastered
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and Vedāṃgas. Your semen is also equally
<div n="lb"/>powerful. How can my womb bear the combined force
<div n="lb"/>of the two semens? So please refrain from this attempt
<div n="lb"/>of yours.” But even after hearing these words of his
<div n="lb"/>sister-in-law, Bṛhaspati was not able to control his
<div n="lb"/>passions. At the time of the intercourse, when the
<div n="lb"/>semen of Bṛhaspati entered the womb, the child within
<div n="lb"/>it cried out—“Father ! this passion is improper. Two
<div n="lb"/>persons have no place here. So withdraw your semen.”
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati did not heed the request. The child in the
<div n="lb"/>womb repelled the semen that entered the womb with
<div n="lb"/>his foot and it dropped on the floor. Bṛhaspati who
<div n="lb"/>became angry, cursed the child. As a result, the boy
<div n="lb"/>was born blind. He got the name “Dīrghatamas”
<div n="lb"/>because he was born blind. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 104).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family Life.%} In brilliance of parts, Dīrghatamas
<F>1. The story of Brhaspati's union with Mamatā is given in Bhāgavata Purāṇa. According to this story the child in her womb was
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja. The Mahābhārata states that the child born to Mamatā was Dīrghatamas.</F>
<div n="lb"/>equalled Bṛhaspati. Dīrghatamas, who was born blind,
<div n="lb"/>married Pradveṣi, a Brāhmaṇī. The couple had many
<div n="lb"/>children, chief of whom was Gautama. But after the
<div n="lb"/>birth of the children, Dīrghatmas fell into evil ways
<div n="lb"/>and became an object of hatred and contempt. The
<div n="lb"/>inmates of āśramas dubbed him a sinner. His wife, was
<div n="lb"/>disgusted with him. One day, the enraged Dīrgha-
<div n="lb"/>tamas, in his fury cursed women as a whole and
<div n="lb"/>Pradveṣī could not control her anger. She, with the
<div n="lb"/>help of Gautama and other sons made a raft and
<div n="lb"/>placing Dīrghatamas on it, floated it down the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. The King Bali happened to see the raft float-
<div n="lb"/>ing down the river. He sent men to bring the boat to
<div n="lb"/>the bank. The King recognized Dīrghatamas and
<div n="lb"/>asked the Muni to beget brilliant and intelligent
<div n="lb"/>children by his queen. Dīrghatamas agreed and the
<div n="lb"/>King sent the queen Sudeṣṇā to him. The queen who
<div n="lb"/>did not find pleasure in the company of the blind and
<div n="lb"/>decrepit Muni sent a nurse to him. The nurse bore to
<div n="lb"/>him Kakṣīvān and ten other sons all of whom became
<div n="lb"/>great scholars. After some years the King came to know
<div n="lb"/>that the mother of those boys was the nurse. Then he
<div n="lb"/>sent Sudeṣṇā again to the Muni. Dīrghatamas, after
<div n="lb"/>touching her body blessed her and five sons, Aṅga,
[Page244-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Puṇḍra and Śuṅga were born to her.
<div n="lb"/>They founded five Kingdoms which were known by
<div n="lb"/>their names respectively. They are known by their
<div n="lb"/>modern names: Bhāgalpura, Bengāl, Āndhra, Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>sāhi and Tāmravika.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) Dīrghatamas had another wife
<div n="lb"/>named Uśik. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka,
<div n="lb"/>112th Sūkta.)
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dīrghatamas continues to be in the assembly of
<div n="lb"/>Indra offering worship to him (Indra). (M.B. Śabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 11).
