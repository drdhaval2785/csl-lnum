PATAÑJALI¦. A celebrated commentator in Sanskrit.
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali is one of the best commentators of Pāṇini's
<div n="lb"/>Vyākarṇasūtras. Pandits are of opinion that he got his
<div n="lb"/>name Patañjali to mean that people should worship
<div n="lb"/>(añjali) at his foot (pāda). He was such an adorable
<div n="lb"/>person. Pandits believe that Patañjali is the author of
<div n="lb"/>Yogasūtra and Carakasaṃhitā. A few believe that
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali was the incarnation of Ādiśeṣa. But modern
<div n="lb"/>scholars are of opinion that Patañjali, the commentator
<div n="lb"/>and Patañjali the author of Yogasūtras are two different
<div n="lb"/>persons.
<div n="NI"/>In his book on Patañjalicarita, Rāmabhadradīkṣita
<div n="lb"/>writes about the birth of Patañjali:—“Once
<div n="lb"/>Goṇikā, daughter of a sage, prayed to the Sun-god for
<div n="lb"/>a son At once Ananta, King of the serpents, fell on
<div n="lb"/>her palm in the form of a sage. The ascetic girl brought
<div n="lb"/>up that sage as her son. After some years the sage
<div n="lb"/>went to Cidambara and prayed to Śiva to bless him
<div n="lb"/>with enough knowledge and wisdom to write a com-
<div n="lb"/>mentary on Kātyāyana's Vyākaraṇavārttika (explana-
<div n="lb"/>tory rules on Pāṇiṇi's sūtras). Śiva blessed him and the
<div n="lb"/>sage wrote the commentary. Many disciples went to
<div n="lb"/>him to learn the commentary and the sage accepted
<div n="lb"/>them all as disciples and promised to teach them provi-
<div n="lb"/>ded they would abide by a condition, namely, that nobody
<div n="lb"/>should remove a curtain he would place between him
<div n="lb"/>and the disciples while teaching. The teaching went
<div n="lb"/>on for some time. He would reply to their doubts
<div n="lb"/>but the replies were peculiar and ambiguous and the
<div n="lb"/>disciples, getting disappointed, removed the curtain
<div n="lb"/>one day. The sage cursed them all. One of the dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciples was away from the place then and the sage
<div n="lb"/>cursed him for leaving the place without permission
<div n="lb"/>during the course of study. He begged for relief and
<div n="lb"/>the sage was pleased. The Guru said if he could teach
<div n="lb"/>his commentary to one who would say logically that
<div n="lb"/>the Bhūtakarmavācyakṛdanta (past participle of a
<div n="lb"/>verb) of the root ‘Pac’ was ‘Pakva’ he would be
<div n="lb"/>released from the curse. Candragupta who came
<div n="lb"/>from Ujjayinī gave the correct answer and he was
<div n="lb"/>taught the Mahābhāṣya. Bhartṛhari was the son born
<div n="lb"/>to Candragupta of a Śūdra woman.
<div n="NI"/>Patañjali, according to Professor Goldstucker, was a
<div n="lb"/>courtier of King Puṣyamitra and was alive when
<div n="lb"/>Menander attacked Sāketa. This would mean that
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali lived before B.C. 150.
