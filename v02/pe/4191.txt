MAHIṢA¦. An Asura.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} Long ago there was a famous Asura King
<div n="lb"/>named Danu. Two sons named Rambha and Karam-
<div n="lb"/>bha were born to him. Having no issue, they decided
<div n="lb"/>to worship Mālavaṭa yakṣa, praying to be blessed with
<div n="lb"/>children. They started tapas, Karambha, in the
<div n="lb"/>middle of water and Rambha in the middle of
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāgni. Indra was alarmed at their tapas. He took
<div n="lb"/>the form of a crocodile and went into the water in
<div n="lb"/>which Karambha was standing and caught hold of his
<div n="lb"/>feet, pulling him down. Karambha was drowned. The
<div n="lb"/>mighty Rambha who was enraged at the death of his
<div n="lb"/>brother, decided to cut off his own head and offer it
<div n="lb"/>as sacrifice in the fire. He drew his sword and was
<div n="lb"/>about to cut off his head, when Agni, the god of fire,
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and stopped him saying:—“Do
<div n="lb"/>not kill yourself. Killing another person itself is a sin.
<div n="lb"/>Suicide is a more serious sin. Ask for any boon you
<div n="lb"/>wish to have; I shall grant it. Do not put an end to
<div n="lb"/>your life.”
<div n="NI"/>Then Rambha replied:— “If you are prepared to
<div n="lb"/>grant me a boon, let me have a son who is more
<div n="lb"/>brilliant than yourself and who will be the conqueror
[Page466-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of all the three worlds. He should not be defeated by
<div n="lb"/>Devas or Asuras, and he should be as mighty as the
<div n="lb"/>wind, handsome and an expert archer.” Agni replied:-
<div n="lb"/>“You will have such a son by the woman who wins
<div n="lb"/>your heart”.
<div n="NI"/>When god Agni had left after saying this, Rambha
<div n="lb"/>went to visit Mālayakṣa, who was attended to by
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas. There, they had a treasure known as Padma
<div n="lb"/>and numerous animals like elephants, horses, buffaloes,
<div n="lb"/>cows and sheep. Among them was a three-year-old she-
<div n="lb"/>buffalo of exceptional charm and Rambha fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with her. She was also irresistibly attracted by him.
<div n="lb"/>As fate would have it, a sexual union took place
<div n="lb"/>between them.
<div n="NI"/>The she-buffalo became pregnant and Rambha took
<div n="lb"/>her with him to his own house in Pātāla. There, the
<div n="lb"/>other Dānavas, his kinsmen who came to know of his
<div n="lb"/>connection with the she-buffalo, expelled him from
<div n="lb"/>their midst as one who had committed a forbidden act.
<div n="lb"/>So he returned to Mālavaṭayakṣa. The pretty she-
<div n="lb"/>buffalo accompanied her husband to the holy Yakṣa-
<div n="lb"/>maṇḍala.
<div n="NI"/>While they were living there, she gave birth to an
<div n="lb"/>attractive buffalo-calf. After that a he-buffalo came
<div n="lb"/>across her. But she remained loyal to her Dānava
<div n="lb"/>husband who drew his sword and rushed towards
<div n="lb"/>the he-buffalo. The terrible beast with his mighty
<div n="lb"/>horns attacked Rambha who fell dead on the ground.
<div n="lb"/>The widowed Mahiṣī (she-buffalo) sought the protec-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the Yakṣas. They saved her from the Mahiṣa
<div n="lb"/>(He-buffalo). The disappointed and love-stricken
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa drowned himself in a holy lake and was reborn
<div n="lb"/>as a mighty and heroic Asura named Namara. The
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣī spent some time under the protection of the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas. When they cremated Rambha's body, she
<div n="lb"/>jumped into the funeral pyre and burnt herself to
<div n="lb"/>death. At once from the middle of the fire there arose
<div n="lb"/>a monstrous being. That terrible monster, armed with
<div n="lb"/>a sword drove away the Yakṣas and killed all the
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣas. Mahiṣa who was the son of Rambha alone
<div n="lb"/>was spared. He was the Asura named Raktabīja. He
<div n="lb"/>defeated all gods like Indra, Rudra, Sūrya, Vāyu and
<div n="lb"/>others.
<div n="NI"/>Mahiṣāsura became the King of the Asuras. The
<div n="lb"/>alarmed Devas (gods) abandoned their posts of
<div n="lb"/>honour. All the worlds were plunged in darkness.
<div n="lb"/>(Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 17).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mahiṣāsura's Reign.%} Mahiṣāsura who was intoxi-
<div n="lb"/>cated with pride on account of the boon he had
<div n="lb"/>received, became the undisputed and sole emperor of
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds. He formed a strong council of
<div n="lb"/>Ministers. Cikṣura who was puffed with pride and an
<div n="lb"/>expert in military Science, was installed as War-
<div n="lb"/>Minister and Tāmra, the gifted economist as Finance
<div n="lb"/>Minister. The Prime Minister was Asilomā. Biḍāla
<div n="lb"/>was Foreign Minister. Udarka became Military
<div n="lb"/>Commander. Bāṣkala, Trinetra and Kālabandhaka
<div n="lb"/>were assigned the posts of Members of the Executive
<div n="lb"/>Council. Śukrācārya was the Education Minister.
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa strengthened his army. The State Treasury
<div n="lb"/>overflowed with wealth. Kings of the neighbouring
<div n="lb"/>states paid tribute and bowed their heads to him. The
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas offered the share of yajña to Mahiṣāsura
<div n="lb"/>and prostrated before him. (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
[Page466-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Outbreak of War.%} After strengthening his position
<div n="lb"/>as Emperor of the world, Mahiṣa contemplated the
<div n="lb"/>conquest of Heaven. He sent a messenger to Indra.
<div n="lb"/>The messenger ordered Indra to surrender to Mahiṣā-
<div n="lb"/>sura. Indra answered with utter contempt to the
<div n="lb"/>messenger and his master Mahiṣa. The messenger
<div n="lb"/>returned and reported the matter to Mahiṣāsura who
<div n="lb"/>began to tremble with anger.
<div n="NI"/>Although Indra sent away the messenger with scorn,
<div n="lb"/>he had no peace of mind. He called together the
<div n="lb"/>Devas and discussed what was to be done. They decid-
<div n="lb"/>ed to declare war on Mahiṣāsura. Brahmā and Indra,
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by the other Devas set out to Kailāsa.
<div n="lb"/>From there, taking Paramaśiva with them, they
<div n="lb"/>proceeded to Vaikuṇṭha. On arrival there, they offered
<div n="lb"/>prayers to Mahāviṣṇu who appeared before them.
<div n="lb"/>They submitted to him their grievances and sufferings
<div n="lb"/>under the rule of Mahiṣāsura. After deep deliberations,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu supported the proposal for war. Thus the
<div n="lb"/>war between Devas and Asuras started.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Devāsura Yuddha.%} It was a dreadful war. Mahiṣa
<div n="lb"/>himself appeared on the scene of battle. He struck at
<div n="lb"/>Indra with his mighty club. Before he received the
<div n="lb"/>blow, Indra broke the club with his Thunderbolt. The
<div n="lb"/>Asura named Andhaka encountered Mahāviṣṇu. The
<div n="lb"/>five arrows of that Asura were broken to pieces by
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu in the sky itself. Then they started a
<div n="lb"/>terrible fight with various weapons such as sword,
<div n="lb"/>spear, axe, arrow, discus etc. It lasted for about 50
<div n="lb"/>days without a break. Bāṣkala fought against Indra,
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa against Rudra, Trinetra against Yamadharma,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāhanu against Śrīda, and Asilomā against Pracetas.
<div n="lb"/>In the course of the battle, Andhaka, struck a blow at
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa with his cudgel. Garuḍa, the vehicle of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was stunned by the blow, but Viṣṇu restored his energy
<div n="lb"/>by stroking him gently with his right hand. After that
<div n="lb"/>he took up his bow Śārṅga and tried to kill Andhaka
<div n="lb"/>with a shower of arrows. But the Daitya warrior
<div n="lb"/>countered all of them with 50 arrows which he shot at
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu smashed all of them and sent his
<div n="lb"/>destructive weapon “Sudarśana Cakra” against
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka. Without the slightest fear, Andhaka stopped
<div n="lb"/>it with his own Cakra weapon and kept Viṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>weapon at bay and shouted in triumph. Finding that
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu's weapon had failed and hearing the scornful
<div n="lb"/>shout of Andhaka, the Devas were filled with panic.
<div n="lb"/>At this critical moment, Viṣṇu took up his club
<div n="lb"/>“Kaumodakī” and rushed into the midst of the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>and struck Andhaka with it. Under the blow, the
<div n="lb"/>Asura hero reeled and fell down unconscious. At his
<div n="lb"/>fall, Mahiṣa himself rushed forward to Viṣṇu with a
<div n="lb"/>terrible roar. Then there ensued a bitter fight between
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Mahiṣa. Each began a shower of arrows
<div n="lb"/>on the other. But not a single arrow injured either.
<div n="lb"/>In the thick of the battle Viṣṇu struck a blow on
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa's head and he dropped down unconscious.
<div n="lb"/>But ere long the Dānava rose up and taking up his iron
<div n="lb"/>pestle aimed a mighty blow at Viṣṇu's head and
<div n="lb"/>brought it down with deadly effect Under the blow,
<div n="lb"/>even Viṣṇu fell unconscious on Garuḍa's back. Viṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>condition made Garuḍa withdraw from the scene of
<div n="lb"/>battle temporarily, with Viṣṇu on his back. Indra and
<div n="lb"/>the other gods began to cry aloud. Śiva, who saw this
<div n="lb"/>desperate plight of the Devas, at once came to the
<div n="lb"/>battlefield, carrying his trident, ready to fight against
[Page467-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa. When he tried to pierce the Asura's chest
<div n="lb"/>with his trident, the latter thwarted the blow with his
<div n="lb"/>own lance and aimed it at Śiva's breast. Although it
<div n="lb"/>actually hit him, Śiva disregarded it and gave another
<div n="lb"/>thrust to Mahiṣa with his trident. By this time Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu had recovered from his swoon. At once he return-
<div n="lb"/>ed to the field of battle and joined Śiva in his attack on
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa. When Mahiṣa saw that both Śiva and Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>were launching a combined attack against him, in his
<div n="lb"/>wild fury he assumed his own buffalo form and lifting
<div n="lb"/>up his tail and shaking his head rushed towards his
<div n="lb"/>mighty adversaries. With his terrible horns he lifted
<div n="lb"/>up mountain peaks and hurled them at the enemy.
<div n="lb"/>But the Deva leaders stopped them with their shower
<div n="lb"/>of arrows. Viṣṇu sent his Cakra against him and it
<div n="lb"/>made the Asura chief drop down senseless. But he
<div n="lb"/>soon recovered and rushed forward to renew his attack
<div n="lb"/>with a terrible roar. Viṣṇu then sounded his divine
<div n="lb"/>conch “Pāñcajanya” and drowned the sound of his
<div n="lb"/>roar. Just as the roaring of the asura frightened the
<div n="lb"/>Devas, the sound of Pāñcajanya struck terror in the
<div n="lb"/>minds of the Asuras.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Mahiṣa's Death.%} The Asuras were terrified at the
<div n="lb"/>sound of Pāñcajanya. In order to encourage them,
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa assumed the form of a lion and rushed into
<div n="lb"/>the midst of the army of Devas roaring. Even the
<div n="lb"/>Trimūrtis were alarmed for a short while when they
<div n="lb"/>saw the fierce beast advancing through their battle-
<div n="lb"/>array killing and mauling hundreds of the Devas on
<div n="lb"/>either side. Mahāviṣṇu at once sent his weapon Cakra
<div n="lb"/>against the lion. The lion was reduced to ashes by it,
<div n="lb"/>but Mahiṣa rose up again in the form of a buffalo and
<div n="lb"/>rushed forward. He gave a severe cut on Mahāviṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>chest with his long and powerful horn. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>started fleeing to Vaikuṇṭha. At the sight of this, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>concluded that Mahiṣa was proof against killing and
<div n="lb"/>so he also fled to Kailāsa riding on his bull. When
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva took to their heels, Brahmā also flew to
<div n="lb"/>Satyaloka, riding on this swan. Although the leaders
<div n="lb"/>left the field, the rest of the Devas under the leadership
<div n="lb"/>of Indra, encountered Mahiṣa again. Indra drew his
<div n="lb"/>Vajra. The Aṣṭadikpālakas assisted him. The battle
<div n="lb"/>raged fiercely again. The Devas began to flee for life.
<div n="lb"/>Taking this opportunity, Mahiṣāsura forced his way
<div n="lb"/>into Heaven. He planted his Daitya flag highly. He
<div n="lb"/>drove out all the remaining Devas. In this way the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras took possession of Devaloka. The Devas took
<div n="lb"/>shelter on the tops of mountains.
<div n="NI"/>Several centuries passed. The Devas assembled and
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Brahmā. He took them again to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva also arrived there. The Devas submitted their
<div n="lb"/>grievances to Viṣṇu. They prayed to him to devise
<div n="lb"/>some method by which Mahiṣa could be killed.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā had given him a boon that no Man was
<div n="lb"/>capable of killing him.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu said to them:—“By Virtue of the boon,
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣa could be killed only by a woman. If we can
<div n="lb"/>create a woman who is part of the Devas with their
<div n="lb"/>power and glory, we could kill him with her help. So
<div n="lb"/>let us try to create such a mighty woman, concentrating
<div n="lb"/>all our powers on her. After her creation, we must
<div n="lb"/>give her all our weapons.”
<div n="NI"/>As soon as Mahāviṣṇu spoke these words, a figure with
<div n="lb"/>dazzling effulgence issued forth from Brahmā's face.
<div n="lb"/>Both Viṣṇu and Śiva were amazed at the sight of this
[Page467-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>figure radiating beams of light which were partly cool
<div n="lb"/>and partly warm. Similar figures, embodying the
<div n="lb"/>peculiar powers and qualities of Viṣṇu, Śiva, Indra,
<div n="lb"/>Kubera, Varuṇa and all other gods, emanated from
<div n="lb"/>them. In a moment all these figures merged into a
<div n="lb"/>single figure and transformed themselves into a single
<div n="lb"/>woman with celestial beauty and having eighteen arms.
<div n="lb"/>This woman of exquisite beauty combining all the
<div n="lb"/>powers and glories of all the Devas was Devī herself.
<div n="lb"/>The devas supplied her with jewels and ornaments and
<div n="lb"/>gorgeous clothes. Decked in all glory and with fasci-
<div n="lb"/>nating beauty, riding on a lion. she took her stand at
<div n="lb"/>the entrance of Devaloka and challenged Mahiṣa. At
<div n="lb"/>the very first sight of Devī, Mahiṣa fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>her. She declared she would become the wife of the
<div n="lb"/>person who could defeat her in battle.
<div n="NI"/>So Mahiṣa made up his mind to defeat her in a fight.
<div n="lb"/>It was a terrible battle. All the Ministers of Mahiṣa,
<div n="lb"/>like Bāṣkala, Durmukha, Tāmra, Cikṣura, Asilomā
<div n="lb"/>and Biḍāla were slain. At last Mahiṣa himself appeared
<div n="lb"/>on the scene to fight with Devī. Mahiṣa started with
<div n="lb"/>a shower of arrows and Devī countered them all with
<div n="lb"/>her own arrows. In the end she attacked him with
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Cakra. The Cakra cut off his throat and he
<div n="lb"/>dropped down dead. The devas raised a thunderous
<div n="lb"/>shout of joy and triumph. (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
