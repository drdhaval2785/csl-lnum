SAÑJAYA I¦. Minister of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Sañjaya, who was equal to a hermit, was
<div n="lb"/>born as the son of Sūta from a portion of Gavalgaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 93).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The boon of Sañjaya.%} Sañjaya who was born within
<div n="lb"/>the circle of the friends of the Kauravas, became the
<div n="lb"/>minister of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. The great work that Sañjaya
<div n="lb"/>did in Mahābhārata was, telling Dhṛtarāṣṭra every
<div n="lb"/>thing that was taking place in the battle-field without
<div n="lb"/>leaving even the smallest events in the order of their
<div n="lb"/>occurrence. Sañjaya was able to do this because of
<div n="lb"/>the boon granted by Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>When the armies of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>pitched their camps on either side of the battlefield,
<div n="lb"/>Vedavyāsa came to Hastināpura and saw Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard about the preparations on either side
<div n="lb"/>for the battle. He did not like to go to the battle-field
<div n="lb"/>and see for himself the events of the battle. He said so to
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa. Then Vyāsa called Sañjaya to him and said
<div n="lb"/>“Sañjaya shall see all the events of the battle directly.
<div n="lb"/>He shall have such a divine inward eye.” Vyāsa con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued. “O king! Sañjaya has inward eyes. He will tell
<div n="lb"/>you everything about the battle. He will be knowing all.
<div n="lb"/>Whenever he thinks of it he will see everything that
<div n="lb"/>takes place in the day and in the night in open, and
<div n="lb"/>in secret. No weapon will cut him and no weariness
<div n="lb"/>will affect him. He is the son of Gavalgaṇa and will
<div n="lb"/>come away unhurt from the battle.”
<div n="NI"/>Because of this blessing Sañjaya used to inform
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra of all the events in the battle at the time
<div n="lb"/>of the occurrence. Sañjaya informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the
<div n="lb"/>news up to the death of Duryodhana. When
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana was killed the cry of Aśvatthāmā grew
<div n="lb"/>louder. Sañjaya who heard this cry early in the
<div n="lb"/>morning, ran to the battlefield with a broken heart.
<div n="lb"/>With the death of Duryodhana the boon of inward eye
<div n="lb"/>given to Sañjaya by Vyāsa was lost. (M.B. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 2; Sauptika Parva, Chapter 9).

<div n="lb"/>of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya ran away from the jungle-fire.
