SATYA IV¦. A hermit in the country of Vidarbha, This
<div n="lb"/>hermit who was a brahmin was a believer in ahiṃsā also.
<div n="lb"/>Once he performed a sacrifice without any killing. His
<div n="lb"/>wife Puṣkaradhāriṇī helped him in the sacrifice. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>deva came there in the form of an antelope to test the
<div n="lb"/>non-killing principle of Satya. The animal came near
<div n="lb"/>Satya and said: “I am a deva (god) belonging to the
<div n="lb"/>Śukra-clan. I dwell in this forest as an antelope, due
<div n="lb"/>to the curse of Dharmadeva. Kill me and complete
<div n="lb"/>this sacrifice.”
<div n="NI"/>Though Satya heard this, he did not wish to kill the
<div n="lb"/>animal. At last the antelope decided to go and walked
<div n="lb"/>eight steps and then returned. Due to the delusive
<div n="lb"/>arts of the antelope Satya saw there celestial maids
<div n="lb"/>and the aeroplanes of Gandharvas. The antelope said
<div n="lb"/>that if he was killed he would attain heaven. A desire
<div n="lb"/>arose in Satya for killing and forthwith he lost all the
<div n="lb"/>attainments he got by penance. (M.B. Śānti Parva.
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 272).
