PAÑCAPRĀṆAS¦. The five prāṇas (life breaths) of any
<div n="lb"/>living being are Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, Samāna and
<div n="lb"/>Udāna. There is a story in ‘Devī Bhāgavata’ regarding
<div n="lb"/>the origin of the Pañcaprāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa met Rādhādevī at Rāsamaṇḍala and in
<div n="lb"/>seclusion they spent in sexual sport the period of one day
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. Then Kṛṣṇa selecting an auspicious time
<div n="lb"/>dropped his vital fluid into her womb at the end of the
[Page553-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sexual sport. Tired by the prolonged carnal sport and
<div n="lb"/>shaken by the impact of the hot semen Rādhādevī pers-
<div n="lb"/>pired profusely and the exhaustion produced deep and
<div n="lb"/>long breaths. The whole universe was covered with her
<div n="lb"/>sweat and her sighs became the goddess of the life-giving
<div n="lb"/>breaths of all created animals. From the left side of
<div n="lb"/>goddess was born Vāyupatnī and to her were born the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaprāṇas. Besides these, another five younger prāṇas
<div n="lb"/>were also born. From the sweat of the Devī was born
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa and from the left side of Varuṇa was born
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇānī. (9th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Māṇḍūkyopanisad gives the following details regarding
<div n="lb"/>the working of the Prāṇas in the body:—Prāṇa was
<div n="lb"/>first used in the sense of breath. Later it got the mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing of life. Life is in fact breath to all living beings. Only
<div n="lb"/>when a man is awake, his mind and sense organs
<div n="lb"/>are active. But Prāṇa is active always both in the state
<div n="lb"/>of wakefulness and sleep. Therefore Prāṇa is the vigour
<div n="lb"/>of life. It may be said that when a man is asleep his
<div n="lb"/>senses merge with his mind and his mind with the
<div n="lb"/>prāṇa. The five factors of Prāṇa are the Pañcaprāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>The first of the five is called Prāṇa itself. It is called
<div n="lb"/>Mukhyaprāṇa or chief Prāṇa. Just as a King appoints
<div n="lb"/>his ministers at different places to do specified jobs the
<div n="lb"/>chief Prāṇa posts the other prāṇas at different parts in
<div n="lb"/>the body with specific purposes of their own. Prāṇa is
<div n="lb"/>seated in the heart and does the work of breathing.
<div n="lb"/>Apāna is seated in anus and directs the organs of
<div n="lb"/>excretion of the body. Vyāna is spread throughout the
<div n="lb"/>body and it is this life-wind which keeps one alive even
<div n="lb"/>when breathing is stopped for some time. When an
<div n="lb"/>archer stands in deep concentration with his bent bow
<div n="lb"/>without breathing he lives with the help of Vyāna.
<div n="lb"/>Samāna controls the breathing-in and breathing-out to
<div n="lb"/>a specified rhythm. Samāna (equaliser) is so called
<div n="lb"/>because it balances the force of the in-coming and out-
<div n="lb"/>going breaths. There is a school of thought that Prāṇa
<div n="lb"/>is not seated in the heart but spread over the ears, eyes
<div n="lb"/>nose and face. Samāna is seated at the navel midway
<div n="lb"/>between the seats of Prāṇa and Apāna. This is also a
<div n="lb"/>reason why life wind got that name. This breath does
<div n="lb"/>the work of prompting digestion. The four prāṇas,
<div n="lb"/>Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna and Vyāna sustain life. The
<div n="lb"/>fifth one, Udāna, takes the soul of the being out of
<div n="lb"/>the body when it dies.
