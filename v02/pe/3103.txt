KĀLAKAVṚKṢĪYA¦. An ancient Saint. During the
<div n="lb"/>reign of the King Kṣemadarśin in the country of
<div n="lb"/>Kosala, his subjects were put to great sufferings under
<div n="lb"/>the misrule and corruption of his courtiers. At that time,
<div n="lb"/>Kālakavṛkṣīya who was a friend of Kṣemadarśin and a
<div n="lb"/>reputed sage, came to Kosala with a caged crow. The
<div n="lb"/>sage went about the country claiming to know Kāka-
<div n="lb"/>vidyā” (Vāyasī vidyā) by which a crow could be made
<div n="lb"/>to tell past events. Actually, the sage was going round
<div n="lb"/>the country in order to gather first-hand information
<div n="lb"/>about the corrupt practices of the King's men. After
<div n="lb"/>acquiring knowledge of the exact state of affairs in the
<div n="lb"/>country, Kālakavṛkṣīya reached the palace. Under the
<div n="lb"/>cloak of the crow's words he exposed some of the impro-
<div n="lb"/>prieties of the King's Minister. Naturally, the Minister
<div n="lb"/>was furious and by his secret instructions his servants
<div n="lb"/>shot the crow to death that same night. On the next
<div n="lb"/>day, the sage himself went to the King and convinced
<div n="lb"/>him of the Minister's guilt. The King accepted the
<div n="lb"/>sage's suggestions and brought about a thorough over-
<div n="lb"/>haul of the administration by punishing or dismissing
<div n="lb"/>the culprits. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 82).
<div n="NI"/>In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 106 we find
<div n="lb"/>that this sage once advised Drupada to make a treaty
<div n="lb"/>with King Kṣemadarśin. Kālakavṛkṣīya was a sage who
<div n="lb"/>flourished in Indra's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 7).
