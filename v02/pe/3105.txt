KĀLAKEYA¦(S). (KĀLAKHAÑJAS).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The Asuras who were born to Kālā (Kālikā)
<div n="lb"/>by Kaśyapa Prajāpati, the son of Marīci and Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>grandson.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%General.%} “Kālakeya” is not the proper name of
<div n="lb"/>a particular Asura. The sons of Kālā (Kālikā) are all
<div n="lb"/>collectively called Kālakeyas. They number about
<div n="lb"/>60,000. Sometimes they fought under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtrāsura and at other times under other Asura
<div n="lb"/>leaders.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Agastya and the Kālakeyas.%} Once the Kālakeyas
<div n="lb"/>started a campaign of hatred against Brāhmaṇas. At
<div n="lb"/>nightfall they used to enter Brāhmaṇa premises and
<div n="lb"/>commit murders, disturb their yāgas, etc. The Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>complained to the sage Agastya. Agastya set out to
<div n="lb"/>capture the Kālakeyas, who were alarmed and hid
<div n="lb"/>themselves in the ocean. Agastya dried up the ocean by
<div n="lb"/>drinking it. But some of the Kālakeyas escaped and
<div n="lb"/>fled to Pātāla. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 101).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Arjuna and the Kālakeyas.%} The headquarters of the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras was Hiraṇyapura, situated near Devaloka. Once
<div n="lb"/>they allied themselves with thousands of other Asuras
<div n="lb"/>called “Nivātakavacas” and launched an attack on
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka. Indra sent his charioteer Mātali and brought
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna to Devaloka. Arjuna defeated the Nivātakavacas
<div n="lb"/>and Kālakeyas in battle. A large number of Kālakeyas
<div n="lb"/>were killed in the battle. (M.B. Vana Parva Chapters
<div n="lb"/>172-175).
