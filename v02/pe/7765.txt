ŪRDHVAPUṆḌRA¦. A mark worn on the forehead
<div n="lb"/>with yellow ochre. This mark should be made by earth
<div n="lb"/>or ochre, which should be taken from the top of a
<div n="lb"/>mountain peak, banks of rivers, seashore, Śaivite temple
<div n="lb"/>serpent-hill or from under a holy basil. The fruits of
<div n="lb"/>wearing the mark will vary according to the colour of
<div n="lb"/>the ochre. Black ochre will afford peace, red soil will
<div n="lb"/>procure docility, yellow soil will get prosperity, and
<div n="lb"/>white ochre will give duty or righteousness. As the fruits
<div n="lb"/>vary according to the colour, so also it will vary accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the finger used to put the sign. If the mark is
[Page810-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>made with the thumb the man will become stout. If it
<div n="lb"/>is done with the middle finger he will have long life. If
<div n="lb"/>it is done with the fourth finger (anāmikā), he will get
<div n="lb"/>food and if it is made with the index finger (tarjanī) he
<div n="lb"/>will get salvation. The form of the mark also could be
<div n="lb"/>changed. The mark may be made in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>flame, the leaf of bamboo reed, a lotus-bud, a fish, a
<div n="lb"/>turtle or a conch. If the mark is as large as ten finger-
<div n="lb"/>breadths it is superfine. If of nine finger-breadths, it is
<div n="lb"/>medium super-fine; and if it is eight and a half finger-
<div n="lb"/>breadths, it is lower superfine. In the same way if the
<div n="lb"/>finger-breadth of the mark is seven, six or five they will
<div n="lb"/>be super medium, medium medium and lower medium.
<div n="lb"/>If it is four, three and two they will be of the low,
<div n="lb"/>medium low and lowest.
<div n="NI"/>It is also ordered that when one wears the Ūrdhva-
<div n="lb"/>puṇḍra in a particular spot of the body one will have to
<div n="lb"/>think of a particular name of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>“Keśava in the forehead, Nārāyaṇa in the stomach,
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava in the heart, Govinda in the neck, Viṣṇu on
<div n="lb"/>the right side of the stomach, Madhusūdana on the
<div n="lb"/>middle of right hand, Trivikrama on the left ear,
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana on the left side of stomach, Śrīdhara on the
<div n="lb"/>left hand, Hṛṣīkeśa on the right ear. Padmanābha on
<div n="lb"/>the hinder Part, Dāmodara on the nape and Vāsudeva
<div n="lb"/>on the head, should be meditated upon.” (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 11).
