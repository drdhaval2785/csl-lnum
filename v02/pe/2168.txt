DURGAMA¦. An asura chief born in the dynasty of
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa and son of Taru, Durgama was an enemy
<div n="lb"/>of the Devas from his very birth. He argued to him-
<div n="lb"/>self thus: “the very strength and power of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas depend on the Vedas; if there is no Veda there is
<div n="lb"/>no yajña, if there is no yajña the Devas do not get
<div n="lb"/>their share of the havis, if they do not get the havis
<div n="lb"/>they will lose all their strength and prowess, and, there-
<div n="lb"/>fore, the best means to teach the Devas a lesson is to
<div n="lb"/>destroy the Vedas.” Durgama decided that the surest
<div n="lb"/>means to achieve that was to perform penance. Accor-
<div n="lb"/>dingly he went to the Himālayas and began doing
<div n="lb"/>penance abstaining from food and drink. After a thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand years Brahmā appeared to him and asked him
<div n="lb"/>what boon he wanted. Durgama said “I must get the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas; I should get all the mantras known to brahmins
<div n="lb"/>and Devas in the three worlds, and all the presiding
<div n="lb"/>deities of those mantras should come and stand before
<div n="lb"/>me and be subject to my control; I must also get the
<div n="lb"/>strength to defeat all the Devas.” Brahmā granted
<div n="lb"/>Durgama all the boons. And, thenceforth the brahmins
<div n="lb"/>could not recollect the Vedas or the mantras. No
<div n="lb"/>bathing, no homas, no daily rites, no rites for the dead,
<div n="lb"/>no yajñas, no japa (repeating divine names) and no
<div n="lb"/>tapas. Symptoms of old age caught the Devas in its
<div n="lb"/>grips. Durgama drove them out of Devaloka and they
<div n="lb"/>hid in mountain caves. Within a hundred years the
<div n="lb"/>world reached the rock bottom of destruction. Water
<div n="lb"/>disappeared from the world. Alarmed beyond measure
<div n="lb"/>at these developments the brahmins went to the Himāl-
<div n="lb"/>ayas and prayed to Jagadambikā (mother of the uni-
<div n="lb"/>verse). Ambikā appeared to them, and their lamenta-
<div n="lb"/>tions brought tears to the eyes of Ambikā, and thus
<div n="lb"/>water scarcity came to an end. Ambikā gave them Śāka
<div n="lb"/>(a vegetable) fruits and roots to eat. Because she pro-
<div n="lb"/>tected her devotees by supplying Śāka to them she
<div n="lb"/>came to be known as Śākambharī, thenceforward. Also
[Page255-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>because she shed tears from her eyes, thenceforth she
<div n="lb"/>came to be addressed as Śatākṣī also.
<div n="NI"/>Being told about the above developments Durgama,
<div n="lb"/>with his army attacked Devī. The fight became fierce
<div n="lb"/>and furious. From Devī's body emerged numerous
<div n="lb"/>Śaktis fully armed. Dhāriṇī, Bālā, Tripurā, Bhairavī
<div n="lb"/>and Kālī with 10,000 hands were some of the promi-
<div n="lb"/>nent and powerful Śaktis which thus emerged. The
<div n="lb"/>army of Durgama was annihilated. Then the fight
<div n="lb"/>commenced directly between Devī and Durgama.
<div n="lb"/>Fifteen arrows of Devī hit the asura at the very same
<div n="lb"/>time and he was killed. (Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
