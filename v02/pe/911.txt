BĀLAVINAṢṬAKA¦. The hero of a story, given in Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka, Taraṅga six, to show
<div n="lb"/>that it is not good to make others angry. The story is
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there was a Brahmin named Rudra Śarmā.
<div n="lb"/>He had two wives. Both gave birth to a son each. The
<div n="lb"/>elder wife died and her son also was brought up by the
<div n="lb"/>younger wife. Being jealous she fed the child with food
<div n="lb"/>too hard for the child and it became lean with stomach
<div n="lb"/>swollen and the bones projecting. It looked an uncouth
<div n="lb"/>figure. Seeing him like this Rudra Śarmā called him Bāla-
<div n="lb"/>vinaṣṭaka (one who is lost when he is a boy). He
<div n="lb"/>gradually grew up. When he was only five years old he
<div n="lb"/>showed extraordinary intelligence. One day he decided
<div n="lb"/>to teach his foster-mother a lesson. On that day he was
<div n="lb"/>sitting alone on the lap of his father. He said to his
<div n="lb"/>father, “Father, I have two fathers”. Thenceforward the
<div n="lb"/>father began to doubt his wife, that she was having a
<div n="lb"/>lover. He grew jealous. He would not talk to her. The foster-
<div n="lb"/>mother thought Bālavinaṣṭaka was the cause for this
<div n="lb"/>change in her husband's behaviour. One day she called
<div n="lb"/>the boy to her mildly and asked him for the reason for
<div n="lb"/>the change in the behaviour of his father towards her.
<div n="lb"/>He said that he would bring about a change in the beha-
<div n="lb"/>viour of his father if he would be cared for properly.
<div n="lb"/>She agreed. Then he took a mirror and held it before
<div n="lb"/>his father and when the reflection of his father fell in
<div n="lb"/>the mirror he said, “Father, I have two fathers”. Imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately the doubt of his father was removed. It is not
<div n="lb"/>right to make even a boy angry.
