KAṆḌU¦. A great sage of ancient Bhārata. He was the
<div n="lb"/>father of Māriṣā (Vārkṣī) wife of the Pracetas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth of Māriṣā.%} Māriṣā, daughter of Kaṇḍu, took
<div n="lb"/>her birth from a tree. There is an interesting story about
<div n="lb"/>this in Viṣṇu Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Sage Kaṇḍu, chief of the devajñas, was performing
<div n="lb"/>penance in a hermitage on the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Gomatī. Devendra sent Pramlocā, an enchanting
<div n="lb"/>nymph, to Kaṇḍu to distract him from his penance.
<div n="lb"/>Pramlocā by her sweet words and enticing manners won
<div n="lb"/>the heart of the sage and Kaṇḍu accepting her as his
<div n="lb"/>wife went to the valley of Mandara and lived there
<div n="lb"/>happily for a hundred years.
<div n="NI"/>One day Pramlocā went and bowed before her husband
<div n="lb"/>and sought his permission to go back to Devaloka.
<div n="lb"/>“Dear, stay here for some time more” replied the sage.
<div n="lb"/>Another hundred years went by. Again one day she
<div n="lb"/>went and sought permission to go home. Again the
<div n="lb"/>sage asked her to stay for a while more. Centuries
<div n="lb"/>passed without the sage losing even a little of his
<div n="lb"/>amour. On the other hand every day it found different
<div n="lb"/>channels of expression. One evening the sage stepped
<div n="lb"/>out of his Āśrama and on seeing that Pramlocā en-
<div n="lb"/>quired where he was going.
<div n="NI"/>Sage: The sun is going to set. I am going to do my
<div n="lb"/>sandhyāvandana. I do not want to bring a break in
<div n="lb"/>my daily ablutions and duties.
<div n="NI"/>Pramlocā: Oh, Righteous one, did the sun set for you
<div n="lb"/>only today ? The Sunset of hundreds of years has gone
<div n="lb"/>by without your knowing.
<div n="NI"/>Sage: Dear, you came to this holy river-shore only
<div n="lb"/>this morning. It was only this morning that I saw you
<div n="lb"/>coming to my Āśrama for the first time. Now the day
[Page384-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>is over and dusk is coming. Why this ridicule? Please
<div n="lb"/>do tell me the truth.
<div n="NI"/>Pramlocā: That I came to you one fine morning is
<div n="lb"/>quite true. But since that several centuries have
<div n="lb"/>elapsed.
<div n="NI"/>Sage: How many years have gone by since I started
<div n="lb"/>enjoying with you?
<div n="NI"/>Pramlocā.: Nine hundred years, six months and three
<div n="lb"/>days have passed since I came to you.
<div n="NI"/>The great sage became very angry and scolded
<div n="lb"/>Pramlocā much. That beautiful maiden heard it all
<div n="lb"/>standing bathed in perspiration. The sage in rage
<div n="lb"/>commanded the trembling nymph to go away from
<div n="lb"/>his presence. Pramlocā, thus reprimanded and sent
<div n="lb"/>away, rose up in the air and travelled by it. As she
<div n="lb"/>flew, the perspiration of her body was absorbed by the
<div n="lb"/>tender leaves of trees on the way. She was pregnant
<div n="lb"/>at that time and the embryo which went forth along
<div n="lb"/>with her perspiration was absorbed in bits by the
<div n="lb"/>tender leaves and sprouts. Wind gathered them from the
<div n="lb"/>different trees and made everything into one. Moon-
<div n="lb"/>light gave it development and gave it the form of a
<div n="lb"/>woman. She was named Māriṣā. That was how Māriṣā
<div n="lb"/>was born of trees (Chapter 15, Aṃśa 1. Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse of Kaṇḍu.%} Kaṇḍu's dear son aged sixteen
<div n="lb"/>died in a forest. Grief-stricken, the sage cursed that
<div n="lb"/>forest and made it a desert. There was no water
<div n="lb"/>there and all the trees became dried and dead.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān and party who went in search of Sītā came to
<div n="lb"/>this place. (Chapter 48, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaṇḍu in the presence of Śrī Rāma.%} When Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ayodhyā after his exile many sages from
<div n="lb"/>all the four different parts came to visit him. Those
<div n="lb"/>who came from the south were Kaṇḍu, Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>Namuci, Pramuci, Vālmīki, Soma and Agastya.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
