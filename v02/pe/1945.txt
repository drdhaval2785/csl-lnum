DHARMĀṄGADA¦. A Brahmin who became a deep
<div n="lb"/>meditator on Viṣṇu, because of his habits in his previous
<div n="lb"/>life. Dharmāṅgada was the son of Rukmāṅgada by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Sandhyāvalī. Rukmāṅgada was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja who lived in the city of Vidiśā. He was
<div n="lb"/>a man of good personality, who lived with his
<div n="lb"/>father and being a generous man he did not hesitate to
<div n="lb"/>give his head to Mohinī for the pleasure of his father.
<div n="lb"/>God Viṣṇu was pleased with him because of his love of
<div n="lb"/>his father and of his loyalty to Vaiṣṇavite deity and took
<div n="lb"/>him bodily to heaven (Vaikuṇṭha). Dharmāṅgada
[Page226-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>lived there for many thousands of years enjoying heaven-
<div n="lb"/>ly pleasures. Then he went astray from divine life
<div n="lb"/>and had to take life again as Suvrata the son of a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin named Somaśarmā.
<div n="NI"/>The wise Suvrata discarded the passions of Kāma (desire),
<div n="lb"/>Krodha (anger) etc. and controlled his senses and engag-
<div n="lb"/>ed himself in penance in Vaiḍūryamahādri. For hun-
<div n="lb"/>dred years he sat in meditation and Mahāviṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>pleased with him and took him and his father to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. At the instruction of Mahāviṣṇu, Suvrata
<div n="lb"/>took life again in the house of Kaśyapa. When he died
<div n="lb"/>he went to Vaikuṇṭha. In every successive birth he had
<div n="lb"/>the remembrance of his previous birth. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 21).
