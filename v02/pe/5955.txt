ŚĀKALYA¦. A maharṣi in the lineage of gurus (precep-
<div n="lb"/>tors). (See under Guruparamparā). He systematised
<div n="lb"/>the Vedasaṃhitās. It was Bādarāyaṇakṛṣṇa, who
<div n="lb"/>became later famous as Vedavyāsa, who first arranged
<div n="lb"/>in systematic order the Vedasaṃhitās. Prominent
<div n="lb"/>scholars hold the view that Vyāsa lived between 1300-
<div n="lb"/>1500 B.C. The saṃhitā text now popular systematised
<div n="lb"/>by Śākalya is called Śākalya śākhā (Śākalya branch).
<div n="lb"/>Śākalya is reported to have saved Kaśyapa maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>once. When king Parīkṣit was cursed that he would
<div n="lb"/>die by Takṣaka's poison Kaśyapa started for his court
<div n="lb"/>to save the king from the calamity. But, Takṣaka met
<div n="lb"/>him on the way and sent him back laden with presents
<div n="lb"/>of gems, ornaments etc. People derided Kaśyapa, who
<div n="lb"/>on account of covetousness, retreated from the duty of
<div n="lb"/>saving the king's life and non-cooperated with him in
<div n="lb"/>every way. In this contingency Kaśyapa sought the
<div n="lb"/>help of Śākalya, who advised the former to bathe in the
<div n="lb"/>sacred tīrthas in the rivers Godāvarī and Sarasvatī.
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa did so and regained his old reputation.
