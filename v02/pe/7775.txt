ŪRṆĀ¦. A wife of Marīci. In the Svāyambhuva Man-
<div n="lb"/>vantara Marīci had a wife called Ūrṇā and six mighty
<div n="lb"/>sons by her. When they saw Brahmā once, they teased
<div n="lb"/>him by calling him ‘a father who had married his daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter.’ Brahmā got angry with them, and cursed them to
<div n="lb"/>take birth as Daityas (demons) on the earth. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly they took birth as the sons of Kālanemi on earth.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
