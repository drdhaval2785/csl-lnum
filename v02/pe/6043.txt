SĀMBA I¦. The son born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa by his wife Jāṃba-
<div n="lb"/>vatī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} A story about the birth of Sāmba, occurs in
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Children were born to Rukmiṇī and the other wives of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa. But Jāmbavatī alone did not give birth to
<div n="lb"/>children. Jāmbavatī was filled with sadness when she
<div n="lb"/>saw the children of her co-wives. One day she went to
<div n="lb"/>the presence of Kṛṣṇa and requested him to give her a
<div n="lb"/>son like Pradyumna. Hearing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to
<div n="lb"/>the mountain where the hermit Upamanyu did
<div n="lb"/>penance and making the hermit his teacher, according
<div n="lb"/>to his advice, did penance before Paramaśiva. He did
<div n="lb"/>penance for the period of a month holding a skull and
<div n="lb"/>a hermit's rod. He did penance in the second month,
<div n="lb"/>standing only on one leg and drinking water alone.
<div n="lb"/>In the third month Kṛṣṇa did penance standing on the
<div n="lb"/>toes using only air as food. When the penance was
<div n="lb"/>continued for six months in this state, Paramaśiva
<div n="lb"/>appeared as Sāmba (Ardhanārīśvara) and asked what
<div n="lb"/>boon he wanted. Śrī Kṛṣṇa expressed his wish. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>said that Jāmbavatī would get a son. Soon Jāmbavatī
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to a son. The child was named Sāmba.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Sāmba married Lakṣaṇā the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Duryodhana. Hearing about the Svayaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>vara marriage of Lakṣaṇā, Sāmba went to Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>and took her by force from among the various Kings
<div n="lb"/>who were present there. Duryodhana and the others
<div n="lb"/>captured him. This news reached Dvārakā through
[Page677-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Nārada. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma went to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura and rescued Sāmba and took the bride
<div n="lb"/>and the bridegroom to Dvārakā. Ten sons beginning
<div n="lb"/>with Sumitra were born to Sāmba by his wife Lakṣaṇā.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Prabhāvatī abducted.%} Prabhāvatī was the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Vrajanābha, the King of Supuranagarī. Sāmba,
<div n="lb"/>with his brother Pradyumna entered the city Supura
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of drama-actors with a view to kidnap the
<div n="lb"/>beautiful daughter of Vrajanābha. They produced four
<div n="lb"/>performances such as ‘Rambhābhisāra’ and three other
<div n="lb"/>dramas and earned the praise of everybody in Supura.
<div n="lb"/>In this way they got access to the palace of the King,
<div n="lb"/>and when the time suited, they took away Prabhāvatī
<div n="lb"/>to Dvārakā. (Harivaṃśa, 2: 93).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%The delivery of an iron rod.%} Once some Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>with Sāmba at their head abused Kaśyapa and some
<div n="lb"/>other hermits who came to Dvārakā. They cursed the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas, in consequence of which Sāmba gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to an iron pestle, which caused the extermination of
<div n="lb"/>the Yādavas. (See under Kṛṣṇa, Para 39, Sub Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The curse of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Sāmba was extremely hand-
<div n="lb"/>some, and even the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>him. Under the circumstances Sāmba tended to be-
<div n="lb"/>come wicked. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to know of the unnatu-
<div n="lb"/>ral attachment between his wives and Sāmba, from
<div n="lb"/>Nārada and cursed Sāmba that he would become a
<div n="lb"/>leper, and cursed his own wives, that they would be
<div n="lb"/>carried away by thieves and plunderers. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Sāmba became a leper and the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa were
<div n="lb"/>carried away by the Ābhīras, after the submerging of
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>After a few years, according to the advice of Nārada,
<div n="lb"/>Sāmba began to worship the Sun, at a place called
<div n="lb"/>Sāmbapura in the basin of the river Candrabhāgā, to
<div n="lb"/>get recovery from leprosy. A brahmin also was brought
<div n="lb"/>from Śuka (Kuśa) island to perform the fast and vow cor-
<div n="lb"/>rectly. (Sāmba 3; Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brāhma Parva, 66.
<div n="lb"/>72; 73. 126; Skanda Purāṇa 4. 2. 48; 6. 213).
