KUMBHA¦. II. Son of Kumbhakarṇa, whose wife
<div n="lb"/>Vajrajvālā bore him two sons called Kumbha and
<div n="lb"/>Nikumbha. Both of them were very powerful, and
<div n="lb"/>Kumbha, in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war defeated the army
<div n="lb"/>of monkeys on various occasions. Many of the ministers
<div n="lb"/>of Sugrīva tried to defeat Kumbha. Aṅgada, son of
<div n="lb"/>Bāli also could not stand up to him. Then Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>fought against Kumbha and flung him into the sea
<div n="lb"/>when the water in it rose up to the level of mount
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya. Kumbha came ashore from the sea roaring
<div n="lb"/>but was fisted to death by Sugrīva. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Canto 76).
