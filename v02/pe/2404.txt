GAYĀTĪRTHA¦. The following story is told in the Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa about the origin of this very reputed sacred
<div n="lb"/>place at Gayā.
<div n="NI"/>An asura called Gaya was once performing
<div n="lb"/>tapas here. As the intensity of his tapas went
<div n="lb"/>on increasing, the Devas got nervous and they
<div n="lb"/>approached Viṣṇu with the request that he should
<div n="lb"/>save them from Gayāsura. Viṣṇu agreed to oblige
<div n="lb"/>them. Meantime the intensity of Gaya's tapas increa-
<div n="lb"/>sed daily. Ultimately Viṣṇu appeared to Gaya and as
<div n="lb"/>requested by him granted him the boon to the effect
<div n="lb"/>that he would become more holy and sanctified than
<div n="lb"/>all the tīrthas in the world.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā and other Devas became afraid of Gaya's
<div n="lb"/>power and prowess and they complained about him to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, who advised Brahmā to request Gaya for his
<div n="lb"/>body in order to perform a yajña. Brahmā did so and
<div n="lb"/>Gaya lay down on earth so that the Yajña might be
<div n="lb"/>performed on his body. Brahmā began the yajña on his
<div n="lb"/>head, and made an offering when the body of Gaya
<div n="lb"/>was not stationary or quiet. When told about this fact
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu called up Dharmadeva (See Marīci, Para 3) and
<div n="lb"/>told him thus: “You please hold devaśilā (a divine
<div n="lb"/>stone) on the body of Gaya, and let all the Devas sit
<div n="lb"/>upon it, and I shall be seated on the stone along with
<div n="lb"/>the Devas, holding the gadā (club) in my hands.”
<div n="NI"/>Dharmadeva did as he was bidden by Viṣṇu. The body
<div n="lb"/>of Gaya stopped shaking as soon as Viṣṇu sat upon the
<div n="lb"/>stone, and Brahmā made the full offerings. Thenceforth
<div n="lb"/>the place became a holy tirtha under the name Gayā.
<div n="lb"/>After the yajña was over Brahmā gave the Gaya temple
<div n="lb"/>20,000 yards (5 Krośa) in extent with 55 villages
<div n="lb"/>attached to it as dakṣiṇā (fee) to the masters of the
<div n="lb"/>ceremony. Brahmā presented the villages to them after
<div n="lb"/>creating therein hills purely of gold, rivers flowing
<div n="lb"/>with milk and honey, houses built of Gold and silver
<div n="lb"/>etc. But the brahmins who got these gifts stayed on
<div n="lb"/>there, their avarice only on the increase perhaps.
<div n="lb"/>Angry at this Brahmā cursed the people of Gayā, and
<div n="lb"/>according to it the brahmins became illiterate and evil-
<div n="lb"/>minded; rivers flowed with water instead of milk and
<div n="lb"/>honey. The brahmins lamenting over their evil fate
<div n="lb"/>submitted their grievances before Brahmā, who consol-
<div n="lb"/>ed them thus: Well, brahmins of Gayā, as long as
<div n="lb"/>there exist the sun and the moon you will continue
<div n="lb"/>to be dependent upon the Gayā tīrtha for your sus-
<div n="lb"/>tenance. Whoever comes to Gayā and gives offerings
<div n="lb"/>to you and performs the due rites for the souls of the
<div n="lb"/>departed, the souls of hundred generations of his
<div n="lb"/>ancestors will be transferred from hell to heaven where
<div n="lb"/>they will attain final beatitude.”
<div n="NI"/>Thus did Gayātīrtha become famous. (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 144).
