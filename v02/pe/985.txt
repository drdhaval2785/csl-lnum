BHADRAŚRAVAS¦. A king whom the Purāṇas extol as
<div n="lb"/>having ruled Saurāṣṭra in Dvāparayuga. At the forest
<div n="lb"/>of Naimiśa sage Sūta told the following story to explain
<div n="lb"/>how Lakṣmī (goddess of wealth) took her abode in the
<div n="lb"/>houses of men.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadraśravā (Bhadraśravas) who was ruling Saurāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>had seven sons and a daughter of his wife Suraticand-
<div n="lb"/>rikā. The daughter was named Śyāmabālā. Once
<div n="lb"/>truthful-Śyāmabālā was sitting under a green-wood tree
<div n="lb"/>with her playmates playing with diamonds and gold
<div n="lb"/>sand when the goddess of wealth disguised as an aged
<div n="lb"/>brahmin woman went to the gates of the palace and asked
<div n="lb"/>for permission to see the queen, Suraticandrikā. The
<div n="lb"/>sentries pressed for details about her and then she said
<div n="lb"/>this: “My name is Kamalā. My husband is a man named
<div n="lb"/>Bhuvanāśva and we live in Dvārakā. Your queen in her
<div n="lb"/>previous birth was a Vaiśya woman. One day she quar-
<div n="lb"/>relled with her husband and he beat her hard and then
<div n="lb"/>crying loudly she ran out of the house. I met her and
<div n="lb"/>when she told me her story I instructed her to observe
<div n="lb"/>a Puṇyavrata (Fasting to any particular deity). She did
<div n="lb"/>it willingly and as a result she acquired great wealth
<div n="lb"/>and happiness.
<div n="NI"/>One day the husband and wife died. Yama, the king
<div n="lb"/>of Death, then sent his orderlies to bring before him
<div n="lb"/>that couple who had always quarrelled with each other
<div n="lb"/>while living. Bound by ropes the ghastly servants of
<div n="lb"/>Yama were about to drag them to their land when the
<div n="lb"/>angelic servants of Viṣṇu with the insignia of ‘Śaṃkha-
<div n="lb"/>Cakra-Gadā’ on their lapels arrived there and those
<div n="lb"/>messengers of Lakṣmī headed by Svaprakāśa cut off the
<div n="lb"/>ropes and carrying them in a Rājahaṃsa chariot took
<div n="lb"/>them through noble paths to the land of Lakṣmī. They
<div n="lb"/>lived there happily for a period calculated at the rate of
<div n="lb"/>a thousand years for one week of Puṇyavrata observed.
<div n="lb"/>In the end to complete the goodness remaining they
<div n="lb"/>were born as King and queen on earth with plenty
<div n="lb"/>of wealth and happiness. But they have now forgotten
<div n="lb"/>about the Puṇyavrata and I have come here to remind
<div n="lb"/>them of it.”
<div n="NI"/>The gate-keeper immediately went to her mistress and
<div n="lb"/>told her all that happened. But the queen, Suraticand-
<div n="lb"/>rikā got angry when she heard the story and ordered
<div n="lb"/>the old woman to be sent away from there with thrash-
<div n="lb"/>es. The old woman ran away from the palace crying
<div n="lb"/>loudly and Śyāmabālā on hearing the cry went and
[Page111-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>enquired about the incident. On hearing the story
<div n="lb"/>from the woman Śyāmabālā got instructions regarding
<div n="lb"/>that Puṇyavrata from the old woman and started
<div n="lb"/>observing it. Within four weeks she got married and
<div n="lb"/>went to her husband's house. After Śyāmabālā's depar-
<div n="lb"/>ture from the palace the wealth of the King began to
<div n="lb"/>wane and they became so poor that at the request of the
<div n="lb"/>queen the King Bhadraśravā went to his daughter to ask
<div n="lb"/>for help. The daughter gave his father a block of solid
<div n="lb"/>gold draped in a paper. But on his return to the
<div n="lb"/>palace when he opened the bundle he found there a
<div n="lb"/>block of charcoal instead of gold. On seeing the mis-
<div n="lb"/>hap the king burst into a cry.
<div n="NI"/>Suraticandrikā then went to her daughter and was well
<div n="lb"/>received and attended to. During her stay there the
<div n="lb"/>Puṇyavrata day of the month came and the daughter
<div n="lb"/>tried her best to make her mother also observe the
<div n="lb"/>same. But the poverty-stricken queen broke the fast
<div n="lb"/>without her daughter's knowledge by eating what re-
<div n="lb"/>mained in the dishes of the children. But the next
<div n="lb"/>month Śyāmabālā compelled her mother to observe the
<div n="lb"/>fast strictly and so Suraticandrikā took the Vrata
<div n="lb"/>successfully. A few days after that Suraticandrikā re-
<div n="lb"/>turned home and to her amazement found everything
<div n="lb"/>in plenty there once more. (Chapter 11, Bhaga 2,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa).
