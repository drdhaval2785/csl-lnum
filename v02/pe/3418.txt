<div n="lb"/>Śantanu. Śantanu had two wives Gaṅgā and Satyavatī.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma was born of Gaṅgā. Vyāsa was born to Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī before her marriage. from the hermit Parāśara.
<div n="lb"/>After the marriage, from Śantanu, two sons Citrāṅgada
<div n="lb"/>and Vicitravīrya were born to her. A Gandharva killed
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada. Bhīṣma brought the three daughters of the
<div n="lb"/>King of Kāśī, Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā as wives
<div n="lb"/>of Vicitravīrya, but on the way knowing that Ambā was
<div n="lb"/>in love with the King of Śālva, she was sent back.
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā and Ambālikā became the wives of Vicitravīrya.
<div n="lb"/>Shortly Vicitravīrya also died. With a view to continue
<div n="lb"/>the royal family, Satyavatī sent for Vyāsa, so that he
<div n="lb"/>might beget children of Ambikā and Ambālikā. At
<div n="lb"/>the time of coition Ambīkā closed her eyes to avoid
<div n="lb"/>seeing the uncouth face of Vyāsa. So she got as son
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra who was blind from birth. Seeing the ugly
<div n="lb"/>figure of Vyāsa Ambālikā turned pale and so the son
<div n="lb"/>born to her was pale in colour. He was called Pāṇḍu.
<div n="lb"/>From Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana and his brothers were
<div n="lb"/>born and from Pāṇḍu were born the Pāṇḍavas. All
<div n="lb"/>members born in the family of Kuru were known as
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas. But later, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra came to be
<div n="lb"/>known by the name ‘Kauravas’.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The origin of Kauravas.%} (Duryodhana and his bro-
<div n="lb"/>thers). Dhṛtarāṣṭra married Gāndhārī the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Subala the King of Gāndhāra. Once Vyāsa reached the
<div n="lb"/>palace weary with hunger and thirst. Gāndhārī gave
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa food and drink. Vyāsa was pleased with her and
<div n="lb"/>told her that she might ask for any boon. She said that
<div n="lb"/>she wanted to get hundred sons from Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa granted the boon. Gāndhārī became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>Even after two years she did not deliver. She heard that
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī, the wife of Pāṇḍu had given birth to a child.
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī became sad. She crushed her womb and gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a lump of flesh. Understanding this, Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>came there and cutting the lump into hundred and one
<div n="lb"/>pieces kept them in ghee-pots. Advising Gāndhārī to
<div n="lb"/>keep the pots in secret, Vyāsa went to the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>The pots were broken at the proper time and hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons and a daughter came out. Besides them Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra had another son named Yuyutsu by a Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>woman.
<div n="NI"/>The hundred and one sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra beginning with
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana are the Kauravas.
