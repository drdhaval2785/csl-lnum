AṄGAMALAJA¦(M) (MALADA—KARŪṢA).
<div n="NI"/>{%General Information.%} (1) This was a country in ancient
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 50).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Viśvāmitra had taken to the forest from Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to protect the hermits and their
<div n="lb"/>yāgas. On the way they entered the Tāṭaka forest.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra told the boys in answer to their questions
<div n="lb"/>thus: “In olden days this place was a countryside
<div n="lb"/>known as Aṅgamalaja or Malada or Karūṣa. There is
<div n="lb"/>a reason for calling the country by that name. Indra
<div n="lb"/>killed Vṛtra and thereby incurred the sin of Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>hatyā and so he came away to this country and lived
<div n="lb"/>here for a while. The Gods found him out here. They
<div n="lb"/>poured water on the head of the unclean Indra and the
<div n="lb"/>dirt, hunger, excreta and Karūṣa having been separated
<div n="lb"/>from his body fell on the soil of this place and was
<div n="lb"/>mingled with it. Indra's body became pure. As excreta,
<div n="lb"/>Karūṣa etc. were mingled with the soil of this country,
<div n="lb"/>it came to be called Aṅgamalaja, Malada or Karūṣa
<div n="lb"/>from that day onwards. One part of the country was
<div n="lb"/>called Malada and the other part Karūṣa. Indra, having
<div n="lb"/>been purified by washing in water returned to heaven
<div n="lb"/>with the gods. After that this country became uninha-
<div n="lb"/>bited for a long time. The horrible Tāṭaka lives in this
<div n="lb"/>forest now”. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga
<div n="lb"/>24).
