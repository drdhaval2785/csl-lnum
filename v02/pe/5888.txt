SAGARA¦. A king of the solar dynasty, Sagara ruled
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Brahmā thus: Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa-Vivasvān-Vaivasvata Manu-Ikṣvāku-Vikukṣi-
<div n="lb"/>Saśāda-Purañjaya-Kākutstha-Anenas-Pṛthulāśva-Prasena-
<div n="lb"/>jit-Yuvanāśva-Māndhātā-Purukutsa-Trasadasyu-
<div n="lb"/>Anaraṇya-Aryaśva-Vasumanas-Sudhanvā-Traiyāruṇa-
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata (Triśaṅku)-Hariścandra-Rohitāśva-Harita-
<div n="lb"/>Cuñcu-Sudeva-Bharuka-Bāhuka-Sagara.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Bāhuka, father of Sagara, was known as
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu also. Sagara was Bāhuka's son by his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Yādavī. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 16). Though
<div n="lb"/>Sagara was a prince he was born at the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Aurva, and there was a reason for it.
<div n="NI"/>Subāhu and Yādavī did not have a child for long. But,
<div n="lb"/>as a result of many yajñas conducted for the gift of a
<div n="lb"/>child, Yādavī conceived. While she was in the seventh
<div n="lb"/>month of her pregnancy her co-wife administered poison
<div n="lb"/>to her with the result that she did not further advance
<div n="lb"/>in pregnancy and deliver in due time. Thus she con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued as a pregnant woman for seven years. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 16). The King became an old man.
<div n="lb"/>During this period Tālajaṅgha, king of Hehaya, at-
<div n="lb"/>tacked Ayodhyā with his army, and Subāhu, despite his
<div n="lb"/>old age, fought back. But the fighting grew fiercer.
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu found that he would not be able to defeat
<div n="lb"/>Tālajaṅgha and so he escaped into the forest with his
[Page662-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>wife Yādavī. They took shelter in the āśrama of sage
<div n="lb"/>Aurva. Subāhu expired there due to old age and
<div n="lb"/>Yādavī got ready to follow him in his pyre. The Muni
<div n="lb"/>prevented her from doing so by pointing out to her
<div n="lb"/>that the child in her womb was a very fortunate one
<div n="lb"/>and would become emperor of the seven islands when
<div n="lb"/>he grew up to manhood. Yādavī delivered shortly.
<div n="lb"/>As the poison (gara) given to her by the co-wife had
<div n="lb"/>immobilised her pregnancy for so long Aurva named
<div n="lb"/>her child Sagara. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters 16
<div n="lb"/>and 17).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%To Ayodhyā.%} Sage Aurva conducted the Upanayana
<div n="lb"/>ceremony of the boy and taught him the Vedas ete.
<div n="lb"/>Once Yādavī wept to hear the boy address the muni
<div n="lb"/>‘father’, and when the son asked her the reason for it
<div n="lb"/>she told him that the muni was not his father, who
<div n="lb"/>was really greater than the muni. She also told him
<div n="lb"/>their previous history, and Sagara decided to return to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā somehow.
<div n="NI"/>The people of Ayodhyā lived scattered here and there
<div n="lb"/>in fear of Tālajaṅgha, and disgusted with such an exis-
<div n="lb"/>tence, they came together and took refuge with Vasiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭha, who told them that king Subāhu had expired in
<div n="lb"/>Aurvāśrama, but that his son Sagara was there in
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama. He further advised them to bring Sagara
<div n="lb"/>back and reconquer Ayodhyā. Yādavī wept at the
<div n="lb"/>sight of the people from Ayodhyā and they insisted
<div n="lb"/>upon Sagara's return to the state as their king. They
<div n="lb"/>waited in the āśrama for five days for Sagara. Then
<div n="lb"/>Sagara and his mother, with the blessings of the Sage,
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ayodhyā along with the people. Sagara
<div n="lb"/>fought Tālajaṅgha, reconquered Ayodhyā and crowned
<div n="lb"/>himself as king. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters 20 to 23).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family life.%} Sagara had two wives called Sumati
<div n="lb"/>alias Vaidarbhī and Keśinī alias Śaibyā. Sumati was
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>As he had no issues for long, Sagara, with his wives,
<div n="lb"/>went to Himālayas and began doing tapas at Bhṛgupra-
<div n="lb"/>sravaṇa mountain. After hundred years Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>appeared and blessed Sagara that one of his wives would
<div n="lb"/>give birth to 60,000 sons and the other to one, who
<div n="lb"/>would add to the glory of the dynasty. Sumati chose
<div n="lb"/>60,000 sons and Keśinī the one son.
<div n="NI"/>The king and the queens returned to Ayodhyā and in
<div n="lb"/>due course Sumati delivered the son called Asamañjasa
<div n="lb"/>who was to bring prosperity to the dynasty. Sumati
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to a lump of flesh, which developed into
<div n="lb"/>60,000 children. They were put in pots of ghee and
<div n="lb"/>they grew up to become young persons. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakānḍa, Canto 33).
<div n="NI"/>Some Purāṇas contain stories somewhat different from
<div n="lb"/>the above about the birth of the 60,000 children.
<div n="lb"/>e.g. in the 9th Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata, the story
<div n="lb"/>is related as follows; “Keśinī delivered the son
<div n="lb"/>Asamañjasa and Sumati did not deliver at all. So she
<div n="lb"/>did tapas for Śiva for children and because of his bless-
<div n="lb"/>ing she conceived. Sumati delivered only hundred
<div n="lb"/>years after continuing to be pregnant, and even that
<div n="lb"/>was only a piece of flesh, and she began weeping add-
<div n="lb"/>ressing Śiva, who appeared before her and cut the
<div n="lb"/>mass of flesh into 60,000 parts. Each piece of flesh
<div n="lb"/>transformed itself into a very powerful and effulgent
<div n="lb"/>man.

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Loss of children.%} Kapila turned into ashes the
<div n="lb"/>60,000 sons of Sagara. Bhagīratha revived them. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see under Bhagīratha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Triumphal tour.%} Sagara ruled the kingdom well and
<div n="lb"/>while living happily thus with his sons, he set out on a
<div n="lb"/>triumphal tour. After conquering the northern regions
<div n="lb"/>he moved towards the south, his object being Māhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>matī, Kingdom of the Hehayas. He destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>Hehayas completely in battle. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 89 and 90).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Evening of life.%} Sagara ruled the kingdom for 300
<div n="lb"/>years. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 91). His son,
<div n="lb"/>Asamañjasa was a tormentor of his subjects. In the
<div n="lb"/>evening of his life, Sagara transmitted the throne to
<div n="lb"/>his grandson Aṃśumān (son of Asamañjasa). The
<div n="lb"/>rest of his life he spent in Aurvāśrama with his wife
<div n="lb"/>engaged in meditation.
