GHAṆṬĀKARṆA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Ghaṇṭa and Karṇa were two Rākṣasa bro-
<div n="lb"/>thers who attained salvation by worshipping Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, daśama Skandha). But the elder brother,
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṇṭa alone is sometimes called by the name Ghaṇṭā-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There is a reference in Dārukavadha (killing
<div n="lb"/>of Dārukāsura) about the birth of Ghaṇṭākaṛṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Dāruka, after having secured a boon from Brahmā, used
<div n="lb"/>to harass the world too much and when his depre-
<div n="lb"/>dation became unbearable Śiva created Bhadrakālī
<div n="lb"/>from his third eye and she killed the asura. Mandodarī
<div n="lb"/>wife of Dāruka and daughter of Maya was sunk in
<div n="lb"/>grief at the death of her husband. She began to do
<div n="lb"/>tapas. Śiva appeared and gave her a few drops of sweat
<div n="lb"/>from his body saying that the person on whom she
<div n="lb"/>sprinkled the sweat drops would suffer from small-pox
<div n="lb"/>and that such patients would worship her (Mandodarī)
<div n="lb"/>and supply her necessary food. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Mandodarī became the presiding deity over small-pox.
<div n="lb"/>On her way back to the earth with the sweat-drops
<div n="lb"/>Mandodarī met Bhadrakālī at whom she threw the sweat-
<div n="lb"/>drops to take revenge for her husband's death. Immedi-
<div n="lb"/>ately Bhadrakālī fell down with an attack of small-pox.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing about the mishap Śiva created a terrible
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa called Ghaṇṭākarṇa. According to Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>directions Ghaṇṭākarṇa licked off the small-pox from
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrakālī's body. But, when he tried to lick it off from
<div n="lb"/>her face she prevented him saying that she and Ghaṇṭā-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa were sister and brother and that it was improper
<div n="lb"/>for the brother to lick the face of the sister. And, even
<div n="lb"/>to this day the small-pox on Bhadrakālī's face remains
<div n="lb"/>as an ornament to her.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The name Ghaṇṭākarṇa.%} This Rākṣasa, at first, was
<div n="lb"/>an enemy of Viṣṇu, and did not tolerate even the men-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Viṣṇu's name. Therefore, he went about always
<div n="lb"/>wearing a bell so that the tinkling of it warded off the
<div n="lb"/>name of Viṣṇu from entering his ears. Because he wore
<div n="lb"/>a ghaṇṭā (bell) in his Karṇas (ears) he came to be
<div n="lb"/>known as Ghaṇṭākarṇa. (M.B. Bhaviṣya Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 80).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Turned out to be a devotee of Viṣṇu.%} Ghaṇṭākarṇa
<div n="lb"/>became a servant of Kubera. Once he did tapas for
<div n="lb"/>salvation. Śiva appeared and asked him to do tapas to
<div n="lb"/>please Viṣṇu as Viṣṇu was greater than himself (Śiva).
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards he removed the bells from his
<div n="lb"/>ears and became a devotee of Viṣṇu. (Bhaviṣya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 80).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Attained salvation.%} Handing over charge of govern-
<div n="lb"/>ment to Sātyaki Śrī Kṛṣṇa once went to Kailāsa moun-
<div n="lb"/>ted on Garuḍa to see Śiva. On his way he dismounted
<div n="lb"/>at the Badaryāśrama, and while sitting deep in medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation there he heard the thundering voice of Piśācas
<div n="lb"/>(souls of dead people roaming about without attaining
<div n="lb"/>salvation). He also heard the barking of dogs, and thus
<div n="lb"/>he understood that Piśācas were hunting animals. The
<div n="lb"/>hunters came to Kṛṣṇa's presence. They were led by
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṇṭākarṇa who was reciting the name of Viṣṇu. Śrī
[Page289-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa felt pity for him. Ghaṇṭākarṇa told Kṛṣṇa that
<div n="lb"/>his aim and ambition were to see Viṣṇu and that Śiva
<div n="lb"/>had blessed that he would realise his ambition at
<div n="lb"/>Badaryāśrama. Pleased at all this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa revealed
<div n="lb"/>his Viśvarūpa (representing in his person the whole
<div n="lb"/>universe), and at once Ghaṇṭākarṇa brought half of the
<div n="lb"/>corpse of a brahmin and submitted it as a present
<div n="lb"/>before the Lord. He explained to Kṛṣṇa that according
<div n="lb"/>to the custom of the Rākṣasas that was the best present
<div n="lb"/>which could be made. Without accepting the present
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa patted Ghaṇṭākarṇa on his back with the result
<div n="lb"/>that he cast off his body and rose up to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Chapters 80-82 and also Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Daśama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Ghaṇṭākarṇa Pratiṣṭhā.%} (Installation of his idol in
<div n="lb"/>temples). Though Ghaṇṭākarṇa was a Rākṣasa, as he
<div n="lb"/>attained Vaikuṇṭha due to the blessings of God Al-
<div n="lb"/>mighty his idol is still installed in temples and wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped. The installation ceremony is described in
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 59 of the Agni Purāṇa thus: “Ghaṇṭākarṇa
<div n="lb"/>should have 18 hands. He cures diseases born as a result
<div n="lb"/>of sins. He holds in his right hand Vajra, sword,
<div n="lb"/>Cakra, arrow etc. And in his left hand broom, sword, cord
<div n="lb"/>bell, pickaxe etc. He also holds the triśūla (trident).
<div n="NI"/>Ghaṇṭākarṇa who turned out to be a Deva is believed
<div n="lb"/>to cure small-pox.
