<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru. There is a tree called Kālāmra in this
<div n="lb"/>forest. This is a very sacred tree standing miles
<div n="lb"/>high above other trees and is being worshipped by
<div n="lb"/>the Vṛddhacāraṇas. By worshipping this tree the
<div n="lb"/>men have become white and majestic and by drink-
<div n="lb"/>ing a juice prepared from its leaves the women keep
<div n="lb"/>themselves eternally young. Chapter seven of Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva says like this about this tree: “Kālāmra stands
<div n="lb"/>towering miles high bearing flowers and fruits at all
<div n="lb"/>times of the year. The Vṛddhacāraṇas worshipping it
<div n="lb"/>are white, strong and majestic. The women drinking
<div n="lb"/>its juice are lotus-complexioned, beautiful, Moonfaced,
[Page110-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>well versed in music and dance and having a life-span of
<div n="lb"/>over a thousand years, remaining young all the time.”
