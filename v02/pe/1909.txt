DHANAÑJAYA VI¦. A brahmin devotee of Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>who lived in the Tretā yuga. Once, in winter, when
<div n="lb"/>for want of proper clothing he could bear the biting
<div n="lb"/>cold no longer, he broke some twigs of the Aśvattha
<div n="lb"/>tree (poplar leafed fig tree) and made fire to warm
<div n="lb"/>him. When Dhanañjaya broke the twigs it gave reflec-
<div n="lb"/>tive pain on the body of Mahāviṣṇu. But Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>who was aware of the unflinching devotion of Dhanañ-
<div n="lb"/>jaya to himself was not displeased but appeared before
<div n="lb"/>Dhanañjaya with wounds all over the body. The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin enquired how Viṣṇu got the wounds and on
<div n="lb"/>knowing that it was the consequence of his breaking the
<div n="lb"/>twigs of Aśvattha Dhanañjaya in utter grief started to
<div n="lb"/>cut his own head off. Greatly pleased Viṣṇu stopped
<div n="lb"/>him from his attempt and asked him to name a boon.
<div n="lb"/>Very modestly he replied that he would be satisfied if
<div n="lb"/>he was given the strength to continue as a devotee of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. (Padma Purāṇa, Kriyā Kāṇḍa).
