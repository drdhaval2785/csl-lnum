<div n="NI"/>Devāpa had seven daughters, viz. Śrutadevā, Śāntidevā,
<div n="lb"/>Upadevā, Śrīdevā, Devarakṣitā, Sahadevā and Devakī.
<div n="lb"/>Devakī was married to Vasudeva. The statement that
<div n="lb"/>Devakī and Kaṃsa were sister and brother is not fully
<div n="lb"/>correct. Kaṃsa was the son of Ugrasena, the brother of
<div n="lb"/>Devaka. Devakī was the grand-daughter of Devaka.
<div n="lb"/>Certain Purāṇas refer to Devakī as the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Devaka. According to them Kaṃsa and Devakī were
<div n="lb"/>children of the elder and the younger brothers respecti-
<div n="lb"/>vely. According to the Agni Purāṇa Devakī was the
<div n="lb"/>niece of Kaṃsa. Thus it is equally correct to say that
<div n="lb"/>between Kaṃsa and Devakī there was brother-sister
<div n="lb"/>relationship as also uncle-niece relationship.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Devakī in previous birth.%} Devakī in her previous birth
<div n="lb"/>was Aditi, the daughter of Dakṣa and wife of Kaśyapa-
<div n="lb"/>prajāpati. (See Aditi, Parva 3).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage and children.%} Vasudeva, the Yādava married
<div n="lb"/>Devakī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was their eighth child. Six sons of
<div n="lb"/>theirs born elder to Kṛṣṇa were killed by Kaṃsa. (See
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa, Para 2). The seventh child, from the very
<div n="lb"/>womb itself of Devakī was passed on to the womb of
<div n="lb"/>Rohiṇī, who was another wife of Vasudeva. Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>was the child thus born to Rohiṇī. The eighth child
<div n="lb"/>was Kṛṣṇa. (For details see Kṛṣṇa, Para 3-8).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information relating to Devakī.%} (1) Many Kṣat-
<div n="lb"/>riya kings attended the svayaṃvara of Devakī. (Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 144, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Following Kṛṣṇa's giving up of his body and the
<div n="lb"/>destruction, due to mutual fights, of the Yādavas, Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>deva, Rohiṇī and Devakī also gave up their lives.
