GṚHAPATI¦. A sage. There is a story in Śiva Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>about this sage.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvānara father of Gṛhapati was living with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Śuciṣmatī in a hermitage on the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā. They had no children and Śuciṣmatī, was
<div n="lb"/>grieved much on this account. She requested her husband
<div n="lb"/>find out ways and means to get a child. Viśvānara,
[Page300-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>went to Kāśī and did penance to propitiate Viśveśvara
<div n="lb"/>and the God appeared before him and blessed him and
<div n="lb"/>said: “You will soon get a son”. Very soon the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvānara delivered a child and the son was named
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhapati. When the child was nine years old Nārada
<div n="lb"/>came there once and warned them against fire. Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>nara immediately went and did penance to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and obtained from him for his son the qualities of
<div n="lb"/>fire also so that fire would be unable to act on him. It
<div n="lb"/>was on account of this that Gṛhapati when he installed
<div n="lb"/>an idol of Śiva at Kāśī gave it the name of Agnīśvara.
