MAṄGALACAṆḌIKĀ¦. A devī. Vedas and Vedavids
<div n="lb"/>alike praise this goddess who is always interested in
<div n="lb"/>granting the requests of her devotees. Because she
<div n="lb"/>showers prosperity on her devotees she became known
<div n="lb"/>as Maṅgalacaṇḍikā. There is another version that she
<div n="lb"/>got the name because she was worshipped by Maṅgala
<div n="lb"/>(Kuja) and because she grants the requests of Maṅgala.
<div n="lb"/>Yet another version is that she got the name because
<div n="lb"/>she was worshipped by the King Maṅgala chief of
<div n="lb"/>the seven islands. Born of the species of Durgādevī she
<div n="lb"/>is very kind and affectionate to her devotees. Parama-
<div n="lb"/>śiva worshipped this Devī before he went to destroy
<div n="lb"/>the demon-trio Tripuras. (9th Skandha, Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata).
