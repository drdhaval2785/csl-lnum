CAMPŪ¦. A literary form of presenting a story in a
<div n="lb"/>mixture of prose and verse, and abounding in beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful descriptions: “Gadyapadyamayaṃ kāvyaṃ Cam-
<div n="lb"/>pūrityabhidhīyate”. Over and above prose and verse
<div n="lb"/>the Campūs use daṇḍakas (very long, involved and
<div n="lb"/>poetical prose). This literary form had its origin
<div n="lb"/>first in Sanskrit and other Indian languages adopted it
<div n="lb"/>with some variations. For instance, though prose in
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit Campūs is really prose, that in Malayalam
<div n="lb"/>is something akin to metrical prose. There are more
<div n="lb"/>than two hundred Campūs in Malayalam. The most
<div n="lb"/>famous of the Campū writers in Malayālam are
<div n="lb"/>Punam Namboothiri, Mahāmaṅgalam Namboothiri
<div n="lb"/>and Nīlakaṇṭha.
