INDRAJIT¦. Rāvaṇa's son, Meghanāda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Viṣṇu,—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Pulastya—Viśravas—Rāvaṇa—Meghanāda
<div n="lb"/>(Indrajit).
<div n="NI"/>To Pulastya, one of the Prajāpatis was born by
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī, Viśravas. Viśravas had two wives, Devavarṇinī,
<div n="lb"/>also called Ilibilā and Kaikasī. Vaiśravaṇa or Kubera
<div n="lb"/>was his son by Ilibilā and Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa and Śūrpaṇakhā (daughter) being the
<div n="lb"/>offsprings of Kaikasī. Rāvaṇa married Mandodarī and
<div n="lb"/>three sons, Meghanāda, Atikāya and Akṣakumāra were
<div n="lb"/>born to them. Meghanāda came to be known as Indra-
<div n="lb"/>jit also, because he had defeated Indra once.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Son of Śiva.%} Though it was Mandodarī, Rāvaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>wife, who gave birth to Meghanāda (Indrajit) the
<div n="lb"/>Uttararāmāyaṇa refers to him as the son of Śiva in a
<div n="lb"/>story as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once, after religious fasting and other rites on a
<div n="lb"/>Monday (to propitiate the Sun-God) Madhurā, an
<div n="lb"/>Apsarā woman, adorned with all kinds of ornaments
<div n="lb"/>went to Mount Kailāsa to offer salutations to Lord
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Pārvatī, Śiva's consort was not present then,
<div n="lb"/>and Madhurā used the opportunity to please the
<div n="lb"/>Lord, and she got pregnant by him. All on a sudden
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī appeared on the scene, and knowing what
<div n="lb"/>had happened in her absence she cursed Madhurā to
<div n="lb"/>fall into an abandoned well as a frog. Madhurā
<div n="lb"/>prayed for redemption from the curśe, and Śiva pity-
<div n="lb"/>ing her sad plight blessed her that after 12 years she
<div n="lb"/>would get herself transformed into a fair damsel and
<div n="lb"/>become the daughter of Maya and would, then, be
<div n="lb"/>married by a great King. According to Pārvatī's curse
<div n="lb"/>Madhurā fell into a well in the forest as a frog. Mayā-
<div n="lb"/>sura was performing penance near the well to get a
<div n="lb"/>daughter. On the expiry of 12 years after Madhurā
<div n="lb"/>fell into the well as a frog, Mayāsura looked into it
<div n="lb"/>and beheld a beautiful girl. He took her to his palace
<div n="lb"/>named her Mandodarī and brought her up as his own
<div n="lb"/>daughter. Rāvaṇa married her. It was at this stage
<div n="lb"/>that Śiva's vital fluid which had, twelve years before,
<div n="lb"/>entered her womb made its appearance in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a son. Rāvaṇa named him Meghanāda. Being Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>son he grew up with great prowess. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Meghanāda's yajñas.%} When once Rāvaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>away from Laṅkā on a conquest of the world, Megha-
<div n="lb"/>nāda went to Nikumbhilā, the central place for con-
<div n="lb"/>ducting yajñas, and performed seven yajñas with sage
<div n="lb"/>Śukra as the chief priest. By the time all the seven
<div n="lb"/>yajñas, viz. Agniṣṭoma, Aśvamedha, Bahusvarṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇava, Māheśvara, Rājasūya and Gosava were
<div n="lb"/>over, Rāvaṇa returned to Laṅkā and sage Śukra
<div n="lb"/>gave him details about the yajñas conducted by his
<div n="lb"/>son Meghanāda. Rāvaṇa did not like the Vaiṣṇava
<div n="lb"/>yāga performed by his son, and Śukra, who got angry
<div n="lb"/>at this cursed, Rāvaṇa that he would meet with his
<div n="lb"/>death at the hands of Viṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>By performing a Śaiva yāga, Meghanāda got the bless-
<div n="lb"/>ings of Śiva, who taught him (Meghanāda) the great
<div n="lb"/>art of Samādhi, which helped one to move amongst
<div n="lb"/>others invisible to them.
[Page330-a+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The name, Indrajit.%} Once Rāvaṇa encircled Indra-
<div n="lb"/>loka with a big army, and Indra, very much alarmed
<div n="lb"/>ran up to Viṣṇu for protection. Viṣṇu told Indra that
<div n="lb"/>it was not yet time for Rāvaṇa's death and when it
<div n="lb"/>was time Viṣṇu himself would slay him. Disappointed
<div n="lb"/>at this Indra returned, and a fierce war ensued between
<div n="lb"/>him and Rāvaṇa. Indra fought with Rāvaṇa, and
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta, his son fought with Meghanāda. When fight-
<div n="lb"/>ing reached its climax Meghanāda resorted to the
<div n="lb"/>art of Samādhi taught by Śiva, and became invisible
<div n="lb"/>to others. Then he showered his arrows. Jayanta
<div n="lb"/>fainted on the battlefield. Pulomā, father of Indrāṇī,
<div n="lb"/>carried away Jayanta without others knowing and
<div n="lb"/>concealed him in the ocean. Everyone thought that
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta was dead. Burning with grief and revenge
<div n="lb"/>Indra confronted Rāvaṇa again. Rāvaṇa fell down at
<div n="lb"/>the blow with Indra's vajra (thunderbolt). Then once
<div n="lb"/>more making himself invisible to others, Meghanāda
<div n="lb"/>jumped into Indra's chariot and bound him prisoner.
<div n="lb"/>By that time Rāvaṇa got up on his feet, and he and
<div n="lb"/>Meghanāda carried away Indra to Laṅkā and chained
<div n="lb"/>him to the foot of the flagstaff.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas, grief-stricken at this sad fate of Indra
<div n="lb"/>went to Brahmā and submitted their grievance.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā reached Laṅkā, and named Meghanāda Indra-
<div n="lb"/>jit. (He who gained victory over Indra). Indrajit
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Brahmā for the boon, which would ward
<div n="lb"/>off death for ever. When Brahmā told him that the
<div n="lb"/>boon of eternal deathlessness was out of the question
<div n="lb"/>he sought the following boon: that when he had per-
<div n="lb"/>formed a yajña, out of the sacrificial fire should emerge
<div n="lb"/>a chariot and necessary horses and that he should not
<div n="lb"/>be killed by any one while fighting from that chariot,
<div n="lb"/>and that he did not mind being killed by enemies if
<div n="lb"/>he got away without completing the yajña. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>granted him the boon. And, as directed by Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa released Indra from imprisonment after one
<div n="lb"/>year. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Indrajit and Hanūmān.%} A clash occurred between
<div n="lb"/>Indrajit and Hanūmān, who landed in Laṅkā in search
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā, and the former got Hanūmān bound by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāstra. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Death of Indrajit.%} At the height of the fierce war
<div n="lb"/>between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, Indrajit and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>clashed with each other. Finding victory impossible
<div n="lb"/>Indrajit created a fake Sītā and killed her. Thinking
<div n="lb"/>that Sītā was dead, grief-stricken Hanūmān, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and the regiment of monkeys withdrew from the
<div n="lb"/>fight. Informed of Sītā's death Rāma fainted.
<div n="NI"/>Indrajit began the yajña for victory over Rāma at the
<div n="lb"/>place called Nikumbhilā. Vibhīṣaṇa told Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa about the warning of Brahmā that Indra-
<div n="lb"/>jit would be killed if the yajña was obstructed. Happy
<div n="lb"/>at the information Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa immediately
<div n="lb"/>went to Nikumbhilā to fight with Indrajit who was
<div n="lb"/>engaged in performing the yajña, and without complet-
<div n="lb"/>ing the yajña he came out and began fighting, and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa killed him. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Chapters 82-91).
