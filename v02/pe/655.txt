AVIKṢIT I¦. A famous King. The son of Karandhama
<div n="lb"/>and father of Marutta. He was honoured even by
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati, having performed a hundred horse sacrifices.
<div n="lb"/>Mention is made in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa that Avikṣit
<div n="lb"/>had seven wives: Varā, Gaurī, Subhadrā, Līlāvatī,
<div n="lb"/>Vibhā, Maṅgavatī, and Kumudvatī. Besides them Vai-
<div n="lb"/>śālinī the princess of Viśālā also was his wife. He had
<div n="lb"/>taken this Vaiśālinī from her Svayaṃvara dais (the
<div n="lb"/>bride herself selecting a husband from those who are
<div n="lb"/>present), defeating the Kings who were present
<div n="lb"/>there. Those defeated Kings, later, joined together and
<div n="lb"/>defeated Avikṣit and took him a prisoner. Finally Kara-
<div n="lb"/>ndhama rescued him. His greatness is described as
<div n="lb"/>follows:
<div n="NI"/>“The righteous man Avikṣit is equal to Indra in pro-
<div n="lb"/>wess. This austere and righteous man has become a
<div n="lb"/>great sacrificer. In brightness he is equal to the
<div n="lb"/>Sun, as forgiving as the earth, in intelligence equal
<div n="lb"/>to Bṛhaspati and as firm as the Himālayas. By his
<div n="lb"/>thought, word, and deed and self control and noble
<div n="lb"/>actions he kept his subjects in peace and prosperity.”
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāṣā Bhārata, Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 4, Stanzas
<div n="lb"/>19-21).
