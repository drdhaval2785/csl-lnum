GHṚTĀCĪ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} She was an exceptionally beautiful apsarā
<div n="lb"/>woman, and she revelled in disturbing the peace of
<div n="lb"/>the sages and becoming mother of children by them.
<div n="lb"/>Ghṛtācī, who succeeded in breaking the penance of
<div n="lb"/>the sages like Kuśanābha, Vyāsa and Bharadvāja
<div n="lb"/>occupied a very prominent position among apsarā
<div n="lb"/>women.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śuka, the son of Vyāsa.%} Vyāsa longed very much to have
<div n="lb"/>a son. Ultimately, after receiving instruction and advice
<div n="lb"/>from Nārada, he reached the peaks of Mahāmeru and
<div n="lb"/>worshipped Mahādeva and Mahādevī for one year
<div n="lb"/>with the one-syllabled mantra OM which is the very
<div n="lb"/>seed of word. By now the great tejas (effulgence) of
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa lighted up the whole world and Indra got ner-
<div n="lb"/>vous and upset. The great Lord Śiva appeared on the
<div n="lb"/>scene and blessed Vyāsa that he will have a son who
<div n="lb"/>would become a very wise man, very much interested
<div n="lb"/>in helping others, and very famous also. Vyāsa returned
<div n="lb"/>gratified to his āśrama. One day, while in the process
<div n="lb"/>of preparing the sticks for producing fire, thoughts
[Page291-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>about a son passed through his mind. Fire is produced by
<div n="lb"/>the rubbing of two sticks. But, he thought, how
<div n="lb"/>could he who had no wife, become the father of a son?
<div n="lb"/>While immersed in such thoughts he saw Ghṛtācī
<div n="lb"/>standing near him, herself having come along the sky.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa did not like the presence of Ghṛtācī. Fearing
<div n="lb"/>the curse of Vyāsa she assumed the form of a parrot and
<div n="lb"/>flew away.
<div n="NI"/>The beauty of Ghṛtācī as also the flight of the parrot
<div n="lb"/>kindled erotic feelings in Vyāsa and seminal emission
<div n="lb"/>occurred. The semen fell on the stick used for produc-
<div n="lb"/>ing fire, and without knowing the fact he went on
<div n="lb"/>using the sticks for producing fire. And, then did
<div n="lb"/>appear from it a son of divine lustre. That son became
<div n="lb"/>reputed in later years as sage Śuka. (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Prathama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Two children by Bharadvāja.%} Once sage Bharadvāja was
<div n="lb"/>taking his bath in the Gaṅgā, Ghṛtācī also came to
<div n="lb"/>bathe. On the banks of the river her clothes caught
<div n="lb"/>something and were removed from their position. The
<div n="lb"/>sight of it caused seminal emission to the Sage. The
<div n="lb"/>semen thus emitted was kept in a Droṇa, (bamboo cup)
<div n="lb"/>and when it was due the Droṇa broke and out
<div n="lb"/>of it came a child. It was this child which, in later
<div n="lb"/>years, became so very famous as the great Droṇācārya.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 149). On another occasion also,
<div n="lb"/>the sight of Ghṛtācī caused emission in Bharadvāja,
<div n="lb"/>and Śrutāvatī or Śruvāvatī was the noble daughter
<div n="lb"/>born out of it. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 63).
<div n="NI"/>{%Hundred daughters of Kuśanābha.%} Kuśanābha, son of Kuśa
<div n="lb"/>was a saintly king. Once Kuśanābha fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>Ghṛtācī and a hundred daughters were born to him
<div n="lb"/>of her. Once Wind-God felt enamoured of the
<div n="lb"/>hundred girls, but they refused to satisfy his desire. So
<div n="lb"/>he cursed them to become crooked or bent down in body.
<div n="lb"/>Later on, Brahmadatta, son of the sage Cūli, straightened
<div n="lb"/>their bodies and married them. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bāla Kāṇḍa, Canto 32).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Birth of Ruru.%} On another occasion Ghṛtācī attract-
<div n="lb"/>ed and subjugated a King called Pramati. Ruru was the
<div n="lb"/>son born to Pramati by Ghṛtācī.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other information.%} (1) Once Ghṛtācī pleased Sage
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭāvakra, who introduced her into Kubera's assembly.
<div n="lb"/>(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 44).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Ghṛtācī danced at the birthday celebrations of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 65).
<div n="NI"/>(3) A daughter called Citrāṅgadā was born to Viśvakar-
<div n="lb"/>man by Ghṛtācī. (See under Viśvakarmā).
<div n="NI"/>(4) A daughter called Devavatī was born to Ghṛtācī.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Devavatī).
