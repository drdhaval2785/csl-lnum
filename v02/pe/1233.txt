BILVA¦. (VILVA). A devotee of Viṣṇu. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story in Skanda Purāṇa about Bilva who lived as a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavite first and then was converted to a Śaivite.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning Brahmā created many things among
<div n="lb"/>which Vilva (tree) (Crataeva religiosa) also was
<div n="lb"/>created. Under that tree an anonymous man began to
<div n="lb"/>live. Brahmā gave him the name Vilva. Being pleased
<div n="lb"/>at the behaviour and devotion of Bilva, Indra asked him
<div n="lb"/>to turn the wheel of administration of the earth. Accep-
<div n="lb"/>ting the offer Bilva requested Indra to give him the
<div n="lb"/>Vajra (diamond) for the smooth running of the adminis-
<div n="lb"/>tration of the earth. Indra told him that vajrāyudha
<div n="lb"/>(diamond-weapon) would be at his disposal, when he
<div n="lb"/>thought about it, if the occasion required it.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kapila a Śaivite reached the palace of Bilva.
<div n="lb"/>After a long conversation both became fast friends. One
[Page146-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>day there was a debate between Bilva and Kapila as to
<div n="lb"/>whether penance or Action (doing one's duty) was
<div n="lb"/>appreciable. In this discussion Bilva lost the equilibrium
<div n="lb"/>of his mind and thinking of the diamond-weapon of
<div n="lb"/>Indra cut off the head of Kapila. In Kapila there was
<div n="lb"/>the power of penance as well as the power of Śiva. So
<div n="lb"/>through Śiva Kapila got immortality. In the meanwhile
<div n="lb"/>Bilva went to Viṣṇu and got a boon that every living
<div n="lb"/>thing in the earth should fear him. But the boon was
<div n="lb"/>futile. This was a turning point for Bilva. The mind of
<div n="lb"/>Bilva changed to devotion for Śiva. He concentrated his
<div n="lb"/>attention on the worship of Śivaliṅga at the forest of
<div n="lb"/>Mahākāla. One day Kapila came by that way and was
<div n="lb"/>greeted by Bilva with honour and regard, and they
<div n="lb"/>again became fast friends.
