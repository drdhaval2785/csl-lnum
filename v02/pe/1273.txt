BRAHMAPURĪ¦. The abode of Brahmā. Brahmapurī is
<div n="lb"/>on the summit of Mahāmeru, with an area of fourteen
<div n="lb"/>thousand yojanas (leagues). Around this city, at the
<div n="lb"/>four sides, (East etc.) and at the four corners (South-
<div n="lb"/>East etc.) there are eight towns, very big and beautiful,
<div n="lb"/>kept by eight protectors such as Indra and others. The
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā which springs from the feet of Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>wets the whole of Candramaṇḍala (Lunar region),
<div n="lb"/>falls down on the Brahmapurī, and dividing itself into
<div n="lb"/>four rivers called Sītā, Alakanandā, Cakṣus and Bhadrā
<div n="lb"/>flows in four directions. The river Sītā flows through
<div n="lb"/>the top of the mountains and passing through the
<div n="lb"/>mountain in the east called Bhadrāśva, falls in the
<div n="lb"/>Eastern Ocean. The river Alakanandā flows to the
<div n="lb"/>south and reaches Bhārata. Then it divides into seven
<div n="lb"/>rivers which unite in the ocean. The river Cakṣus pas-
<div n="lb"/>ses through the mountains in the west and enters the
<div n="lb"/>country called Ketumālavarṣa and then flows into the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. The river Bhadrā passes through all the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tains in the north and flows through the north country
<div n="lb"/>of the Kurūṣa and falls in the North Ocean. The moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain of Mālyavān in the west and the mountain of
<div n="lb"/>Gandhamādana in the east are as long as the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain of Nīlagiri in the north and the mountain of
<div n="lb"/>Niṣadha in the south. Mount Meru shaped like an ear-
<div n="lb"/>ring stands in the middle of these four mountains.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 21).
