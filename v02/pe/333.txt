AÑJANĀ¦. 1) Mother of Hanūmān—Wife of Kesarī,
<div n="lb"/>the noble monkey and daughter of Kuñjara, the monkey
<div n="lb"/>leader. She was the mother of Hanūmān. Once while
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Pārvatī were gamboling in the guise of monkeys,
<div n="lb"/>rambling through the woods, Pārvatī became pregnant,
<div n="lb"/>That pregnancy was given to Vāyu. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā was doing penance for an issue. Vāyu transferred
<div n="lb"/>the pregnancy he had received from Pārvatī to
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā. Thus Añjanā gave birth to Hanūmān. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 66).
<div n="NI"/>Añjanā gave birth to Hanūmān in the woods in a valley
<div n="lb"/>on the southern side of Mahāmeru. She was frightened
<div n="lb"/>at the sight of the child shining like the sun. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>began to cry for mother's milk. Añjanā said to Hanū-
<div n="lb"/>mān: “Monkeys are fond of red ripe fruits. There-
<div n="lb"/>fore eat whatever you find in red colour.” Saying this
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā transformed herself into a goddess and went to
<div n="lb"/>Heaven.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pūrvajanma (Previous Birth).%} In her previous
<div n="lb"/>birth Añjanā was a goddess named Puñjikastala (Māna-
<div n="lb"/>garva). As a result of a curse, this goddess was born
<div n="lb"/>as a she-monkey in the Himālaya region. With the birth
<div n="lb"/>of Hanūmān, the curse was lifted. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="lb"/>For more details see “Puñjikastala”.
