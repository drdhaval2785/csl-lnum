SUDAKṢIṆA¦ 1. The son of king Pauṇḍraka. Śrī-
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa killed Pauṇḍraka in battle and his head, cut
<div n="lb"/>off by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, fell in the country of Kāśī. Sudak-
<div n="lb"/>ṣiṇa who learned about the death of his father, went
<div n="lb"/>to Kāśī and recognized the head by the ear-rings. Sud-
<div n="lb"/>akṣiṇa made up his mind to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa somehow
<div n="lb"/>or other and began to do penance in Kāśī before
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Pleased with his penance Śiva appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and advised him to create a wicked fairy from
<div n="lb"/>the fire of sorcery. Accordingly Sudakṣiṇa prepared a
<div n="lb"/>fire of sorcery, from which a wicked fairy came out and
<div n="lb"/>ran towards Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent his weapon the
<div n="lb"/>Discus which cut off the head of the wicked fairy and
<div n="lb"/>from there the Discus flew to Kāśi and turned Sudak-
<div n="lb"/>ṣiṇa to ashes, and returned to Dvārakā. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 10).
