<div n="lb"/>inner darkness or ignorance he was called Apāntara-
<div n="lb"/>tamas. The sage, who was cognizant of the past, the
<div n="lb"/>present and the future divided and systematized the

<div n="lb"/>son of Parāśara and once again divide and systematize
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas, and so was he born as Vyāsa. (Śrī Śaṅkara's
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍakopaniṣad and Brahmasūtra Bhāṣya).
