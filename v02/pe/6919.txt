SUDARŚANA VII¦. The son born to god Fire by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśanā. (Sudarśanā was the daughter of Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>(Nīla) of the dynasty of Ikṣvāku. For the story of her
<div n="lb"/>marriage see under Sudarśanā). Sudarśana, the son of
<div n="lb"/>Fire, married Oghavatī the daughter of Oghavān. That
<div n="lb"/>story is given below:-
<div n="NI"/>Oghavān had two children a daughter named Oghavatī
<div n="lb"/>and a son named Ogharatha. Oghavān gave his daughter
<div n="lb"/>in marriage to Sudarśana who was wise and learned.
<div n="lb"/>The couple lived in Kurukṣetra. Once Sudarśana said
<div n="lb"/>to Oghavatī thus:- “You should honour guests in all
<div n="lb"/>ways. If it is the desire of a guest, you should not draw
<div n="lb"/>back from giving even your body. Whether I am present
<div n="lb"/>here or not a guest should not be insulted.” Oghavatī
<div n="lb"/>promised to obey the order of her husband to the letter.
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana had been trying to become victorious over
<div n="lb"/>Mṛtyu (Death) and so Death had been waiting to find
<div n="lb"/>out some vulnerable point in Sudarśana's life. While
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana had gone to cut firewood, a brahmin entered
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage and said to Oghavatī:- “If you do observe
<div n="lb"/>the duties of a house-holder show hospitality to me.”
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this, Oghavatī welcomed the brahmin and per-
<div n="lb"/>formed the usual hospitality and asked him “What
<div n="lb"/>shall I do for you?” “Give yourself to me”, was the
<div n="lb"/>answer. Seeing that the guest was not contented with
<div n="lb"/>the usual hospitalities and remembering the words of her
<div n="lb"/>husband, Oghavatī gave herself to the guest. Both of
<div n="lb"/>them entered the interior of the hermitage. At this
<div n="lb"/>moment Sudar ana returned with firewood, and looked
<div n="lb"/>for Oghavatī and called her aloud, several times. He
<div n="lb"/>got no reply. Then the Brahmin who was lying inside
<div n="lb"/>called out:-“Hei! Son of Fire! A guest has come. Your
<div n="lb"/>wife showed all kinds of hospitality. But I was not con-
<div n="lb"/>tented with them. Now she is offering herself to me.”
<div n="NI"/>These words did not seem to make any change in
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana. Dharmadeva was much pleased, as Sudar-
<div n="lb"/>śana had come out victorious in all these tests. He came
<div n="lb"/>out and appeared in his own form and blessed Sudar-
<div n="lb"/>śana. Due to the blessing of Dharmadeva, half of the
<div n="lb"/>body of Oghavatī flowed as the river Oghavatī and the
<div n="lb"/>other half was dissolved in the soul of her husband.
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana thus earned victory over Mṛtyu and obtained
<div n="lb"/>prosperity.
