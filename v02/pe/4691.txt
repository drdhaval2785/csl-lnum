NAKULA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The fourth of the Pāṇḍavas. Mādrī, the
<div n="lb"/>second of the two wives of Pāṇḍu meditated on the twin
<div n="lb"/>gods Aśvinīdevas, and recited one of the Mantras given
<div n="lb"/>to Kuntī by the hermit Durvāsas and the two sons
<div n="lb"/>Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her from those
<div n="lb"/>gods. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 67, Stanza 111 that Nakula and Sahadeva
<div n="lb"/>were immensely handsome.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Story of Nakula till the Bhārata battle.%} Naming and
<div n="lb"/>such other rituals after birth were performed for Nakula
<div n="lb"/>also as in the case of the other Pāṇḍava children, by the
<div n="lb"/>hermits who lived in Śataśṛṅga. The ceremony of in-
<div n="lb"/>vestiture with the Brahmā string was conducted by
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa the priest of Vasudeva. The royal hermit Śuka
<div n="lb"/>taught Nakula archery and swordsplay, in his
<div n="lb"/>boyhood. When Pāṇḍu died, Mādrī jumped into the
[Page518-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre and died leaving her two sons with Kuntī.
<div n="lb"/>After this the hermits of Śataśṛṅga took Kuntī and her
<div n="lb"/>five sons to Bhīṣma at Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>At Hastināpura, Nakula learned archery under the great
<div n="lb"/>teacher Droṇa. According to the instruction of the
<div n="lb"/>teacher, Arjuna had to fight with him (teacher) on the
<div n="lb"/>completion of the teaching and during that fight Nakula
<div n="lb"/>and Sahadeva were the guards of Arjuna's chariot-
<div n="lb"/>wheels. As Nakula was such an expert in wielding the
<div n="lb"/>weapons, he got the name ‘Atirathi’. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 138, Stanza 30). When the lac-palace was
<div n="lb"/>completed at Vāraṇāvata, the Pāṇḍavas shifted to that
<div n="lb"/>mansion by the instruction of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. When the
<div n="lb"/>lac-palace was set fire to, the Pāṇḍavas escaped by way
<div n="lb"/>of an underground passage and reached the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Gaṅgā. There Nakula and Sahadeva fell down
<div n="lb"/>weary and exhausted. Bhīma carried them on his
<div n="lb"/>shoulders. After Baka had been killed, they proceeded
<div n="lb"/>to Pāñcālapura, where at the Svayaṃvara (marriage)
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī became the wife of the Pāṇḍavas. They returned
<div n="lb"/>to Hastināpura. A son named Śatānīka was born to
<div n="lb"/>Nakula by Pāñcālī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 95,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 75).
<div n="NI"/>After that Nakula married Kareṇumatī, the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of the King of Cedi. A son named Niramitra was born
<div n="lb"/>to the couple. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 95, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>70).
<div n="NI"/>Nakula was then sent to the kingdoms of the west for
<div n="lb"/>regional conquest, by Dharmaputra. The wealth of the
<div n="lb"/>kingdoms he had conquered, was carried on ten
<div n="lb"/>thousand camels to the capital Hastināpura. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 32). After the Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>(imperial consecration) of Yudhiṣṭhira, Nakula went
<div n="lb"/>to Gāndhāra to escort Subala and his sons. After the
<div n="lb"/>defeat of Yudhiṣṭhira in the game of dice, the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas went to live in the forest. At that time Nakula put
<div n="lb"/>soil all over his body and sat on the ground because of
<div n="lb"/>his profound grief. In the forest, once Jaṭāsura carried
<div n="lb"/>away Nakula. (See under Jaṭāsura). Nakula killed
<div n="lb"/>Kṣemaṅkara, Mahāmaha and Suratha in the forest
<div n="lb"/>At Dvaitavana (a forest) Nakula went to a lake to
<div n="lb"/>fetch water and was killed by Dharmadeva who appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the form of a crane. At the request of Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra, who came afterwards, all the Pāṇḍavas includ-
<div n="lb"/>ing Nakula were brought to life again, by Dharma.
<div n="NI"/>During the pseudonymity of the Pāṇḍavas at the city of
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa, Nakula assumed the name Granthika. When
<div n="lb"/>the period of pseudonymity expired, Nakula fought
<div n="lb"/>with the Trigartas on behalf of the King Virāṭa. On
<div n="lb"/>the return of the Pāṇḍavas after the expiry of their
<div n="lb"/>forest-life and pseudonymity, when Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>announced that he would give not even a single dot of
<div n="lb"/>land to them, Nakula was very eager to decide the
<div n="lb"/>matter by a battle. He proposed that the King Dru-
<div n="lb"/>pada should be made the chief captain of the army.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nakula in the Bhārata-battle.%} The following is the
<div n="lb"/>part played by Nakula in the battle of Kurukṣetra.
