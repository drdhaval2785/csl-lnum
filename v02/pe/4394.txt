MĀRĪCA I¦. The uncle of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} On the banks of the river Sarayū, there were
<div n="lb"/>two states lying adjacent called Malada and Karūṣa.
<div n="lb"/>The great sages conducted Jaladhārā (showering of
<div n="lb"/>water) on the head of Indra to absolve him of his sin
<div n="lb"/>of killing Vṛtrāsura at this place. At that time Mala (ex-
<div n="lb"/>creta) and Karūṣa (spittings) of Indra fell at those places
<div n="lb"/>and so they got the name of Malada and Karūṣa. At
<div n="lb"/>that place was born after a few years a demoness named
<div n="lb"/>Tāṭakā who had the strength of a thousand elephants.
<div n="lb"/>A demon called Sunda married Tāṭakā and she got
<div n="lb"/>two sons named Mārīca and Subāhu. (Sarga 24, Bāla
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa and Bāla Kāṇḍa, Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mārīca in his previous birth.%} Mārīca was the servant
<div n="lb"/>of the gate-keepers of Vaikuṇṭha. One day Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was displeased by a conduct of his and he cursed him
<div n="lb"/>to be born as a demon on earth. But he added that
<div n="lb"/>Mārīcawould get salvation from the curse when he was
<div n="lb"/>killed by Śrī Rāma in which capacity Viṣṇu would in-
<div n="lb"/>carnate soon. He would then return to Vaikuṇṭha to
<div n="lb"/>his original place. That was how Mārīca was born as
<div n="lb"/>the uncle of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Āśrama life.%} Mārīca and Subāhu were two insepara-
<div n="lb"/>ble brothers. They learned all tactics of war and their
<div n="lb"/>hobby was to torment the innocent sages of the forests
<div n="lb"/>(Sarga 19, Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). When
<div n="lb"/>the exploits of Mārīca became unbearable, Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>brought Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa from Ayodhyā for help.
<div n="lb"/>The instant Mārīca heard the fierce twang of Rāma's
<div n="lb"/>bow he fled to the other shore of the sea. From that
<div n="lb"/>day onwards Mārīca grew matted hair and wore
<div n="lb"/>barks of trees and spent his life in an āśrama. (Sargas
<div n="lb"/>35 and 36, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were living in
<div n="lb"/>the Daṇḍakāraṇya with Sītā they were annoyed by a
[Page487-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>demoness named Śūrpaṇakhā. In the fight that ensued
<div n="lb"/>very many demons were killed. Śūrpaṇakhā complained
<div n="lb"/>to Rāvaṇa who decided to kill Rāma and carry away
<div n="lb"/>Sītā. For this he sought the help of his uncle Mārīca.
<div n="lb"/>Flying in his golden Vimāna and crossing mountains and
<div n="lb"/>oceans he approached Mārīca and told him of his plan.
<div n="lb"/>Mārīca who was aware of the force of Rāmabāṇa dis-
<div n="lb"/>suaded Rāvaṇa from such a venture. But Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>persisted in his plan and gave Mārīca the following
<div n="lb"/>instructions: “Become a golden deer with beautiful
<div n="lb"/>white spots all over the body and roam about near the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Rāma for his wife Sītā to see. I am sure Sītā
<div n="lb"/>will request her husband Rāma to catch hold of you.
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa will follow you and Sītā will be
<div n="lb"/>left alone. I will then carry away Sītā as Rāhu takes
<div n="lb"/>Candrikā (moonlight) and live happily with her. I will
<div n="lb"/>be contented if I can then tease Rāma who will be
<div n="lb"/>lamenting over his separation from his wife”. Thinking
<div n="lb"/>that it would be better to die at the hands of Rāma
<div n="lb"/>than at the hands of Rāvaṇa, Mārīca agreed to do as
<div n="lb"/>his nephew desired.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa and Mārīca came near the āśrama of Rāma in
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's aerial chariot. Mārīca on alighting from it
<div n="lb"/>took the form of a beautiful fawn and entered the pre-
<div n="lb"/>cincts of the āśrama. The false fawn was capable of
<div n="lb"/>attracting the attention of anybody. It is described
<div n="lb"/>thus: “It appeared as a wonder to those who saw it.
<div n="lb"/>It was golden in colour with blue horns with white
<div n="lb"/>lines on it. The ears were like leaves of blue lotus and
<div n="lb"/>the face was of the colour of red lotus. The lips were like
<div n="lb"/>sapphire and the body beautifully shaped with sides
<div n="lb"/>like yellow flowers. The waist was thin and well-shaped
<div n="lb"/>and a rain-bow-coloured tail adorned its back. The
<div n="lb"/>whole body was silver-spotted and the deer was a feast
<div n="lb"/>for the eyes of anybody.”
<div n="NI"/>The deer went and grazed in places where it could be
<div n="lb"/>seen by Sītā. It would run away from the āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>graze hidden from Sītā but would come back again to
<div n="lb"/>the vision of Sītā. It would mix with the deer of the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama for some time and run away from them to dis-
<div n="lb"/>tant places. Like a butterfly it flitted about always
<div n="lb"/>trying to attract the attention of Sītā. Other deer appro-
<div n="lb"/>ached it but on getting its scent flew away from it. The
<div n="lb"/>false deer suppressing the demon-instinct in him to kill
<div n="lb"/>and eat the animals which came near it played well the
<div n="lb"/>role of a fawn.
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was enamoured of the deer and expressed to Rāma
<div n="lb"/>her desire to get it. Rāma followed it and finding it
<div n="lb"/>keeping a distance always got suspicious and shot it
<div n="lb"/>down with an arrow. The deer cried “Hā Lakṣmaṇa”
<div n="lb"/>and fell down dead. The cry was intended to mislead
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa and draw him also away from Sītā.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 43-44, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
