RUDRA¦. A form of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The birth of Rudra is from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Even before the creation of the Prajāpatis,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā had created Sanandana, Sanaka, Sanātana and
<div n="lb"/>Sanatkumāra. These four were not desirous of mundane
<div n="lb"/>pleasures and were not prepared to beget children.
<div n="lb"/>They were great sages and scholars, of abstinence and
<div n="lb"/>without any discord and animosity. When these four
<div n="lb"/>showed no interest at all in the creation of the world,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā became angry to such an extent that he was
<div n="lb"/>prepared to destroy the three worlds. At that time the
<div n="lb"/>whole of the three worlds shone in the radiance that
<div n="lb"/>emanated from the fire of the fury of Brahmā. Then
<div n="lb"/>from his shining eyebrows which were curved with fury,
<div n="lb"/>a figure of unbearable radiance like the mid-day sun
<div n="lb"/>came out. That figure was Rudra. Half of the fierce
<div n="lb"/>body of that Rudra who was very furious, was a woman
<div n="lb"/>and the other half was a man. Brahmā, saying, “Divide
<div n="lb"/>body”, disappeared. Instantly Rudra split himself into
<div n="lb"/>the figure of a man and the figure of a woman. He
<div n="lb"/>again divided the body of the man into eleven parts.
<div n="lb"/>These eleven figures are the eleven Rudras.
<div n="NI"/>The names of the eleven Rudras are given differently
<div n="lb"/>in different Purāṇas. In a text it is said that the eleven
<div n="lb"/>Rudras are, Manyu, Manu, Mahīnasa, Mahān, Śiva, Ṛtu-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja, Ugraretas, Bhava, Kāma, Vāmadeva and Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>vrata. According to some other Purāṇas, the eleven
<div n="lb"/>Rudras are Aja, Ekapāda (Ekapāt), Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā,
<div n="lb"/>Rudra, Hara, Śambhu, Tryambaka, Aparājita, Īśāna
<div n="lb"/>and Tribhuvana. Brahmā apportioned to the eleven
<div n="lb"/>Rudras the eleven positions of the heart, the five organs
<div n="lb"/>of senses and the organs of action and to Rudra
<div n="lb"/>the eight positions of life, ether, air, fire, water, earth,
<div n="lb"/>the sun and the moon. It was said before that Rudra
<div n="lb"/>was divided into man and woman. From the woman-
<div n="lb"/>portion eleven Rudrāṇīs came into being. They were
<div n="lb"/>Dhī, Vṛtti, Uśanā, Umā, Niyutā, Sarpis, Ilā, Ambikā,
<div n="lb"/>Irāvatī, Sudhā and Dīkṣā. The eleven Rudraṇīs became
<div n="lb"/>the wives of the eleven Rudras. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1.
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other information regarding Rudra.%} Details about
<div n="lb"/>the orgin, life, character etc. of Rudra which occur in
<div n="lb"/>other Purāṇas are given below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Thirtythree children were born to Prajāpati Kaśya-
<div n="lb"/>pa, by his wife Aditi, as Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras and
<div n="lb"/>Aśvins. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sarga 14).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) From the fury of Brahmā, Rudra was born; from
<div n="lb"/>the lap of Brahmā, Nārada was born; from the right
<div n="lb"/>thumb, Dakṣa; from the mind, Sanaka and the others;
<div n="lb"/>and from the left thumb, a daughter named Vīraṇī was
<div n="lb"/>born. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In the beginning of Kalpa (Age of Brahmā)
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā meditated upon getting a child like himself
<div n="lb"/>and a child of blue complexion appeared on his lap.
<div n="lb"/>He ran here and there crying aloud. Brahmā asked him
<div n="lb"/>“Why are you crying?” He replied: “I must be named.”
<div n="lb"/>Because he was crying (doing rodana) Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>named him Rudra (He who cries). He cried seven times
<div n="lb"/>more. Brahmā gave him seven more names. They
<div n="lb"/>were Bhava, Śarva, Īśāna, Paśupati, Bhīma, Ugra and
<div n="lb"/>Mahādeva. Thus there were eight Rudras. To each of
<div n="lb"/>them, Brahmā gave a position and wives and children.
[Page655-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>The Sun, water, earth, air, fire, ether, Brahmin who
<div n="lb"/>has taken vow and the moon were allotted to them as
<div n="lb"/>their positions and figures. Their wives were Suvarcalā,
<div n="lb"/>Uṣā, Vikeśī Śivā, Svāhā, Dīśā, Dīkṣā and Rohiṇī.
<div n="lb"/>This world is filled by the sons and grandsons and so on
<div n="lb"/>of these wives. Their sons respectively were Śanaiścara
<div n="lb"/>Śukra, Lohitāṅga, Manojava, Skanda, Sarga, Santāna
<div n="lb"/>and Budha. This Rudra who is described above,
<div n="lb"/>married Satī the daughter of Prajāpati Dakṣa. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 8). (For further information
<div n="lb"/>see under ŚIVA also).
