RUŚAMĀ¦. A Priest who had studied the Vedas well.
<div n="lb"/>A story occurs in the ‘Pañcaviṃśabrāhmaṇa’, about
<div n="lb"/>this priest.
[Page658-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Once Indra and Ruśamā bet on going round the
<div n="lb"/>world. Both got ready and started. But Ruśamā
<div n="lb"/>walked round Kurukṣetra and returned, while Indra
<div n="lb"/>travelled the whole of the way round the world and
<div n="lb"/>kept the conditions. The question arose as to who won
<div n="lb"/>the bet. The devas gave the decision, “Kurukṣetra is
<div n="lb"/>the dais of Brahmā, and so Kurukṣetra contains the
<div n="lb"/>entire world. Therefore both Indra and Ruśamā were
<div n="lb"/>declared to have won the bet.”
