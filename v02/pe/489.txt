AŚMAKA I¦. Son born to Vasiṣṭha by the wife of Kalmā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣapāda the King of Ayodhyā. (See Ikṣvāku vaṃśa) while
<div n="lb"/>the King Kalmāṣapāda was walking through the forest
<div n="lb"/>hunting he saw Śakti the son of Vasiṣṭha. As Śakti did not
<div n="lb"/>care to give room for the King, Kalmāṣapāda wounded
<div n="lb"/>Śakti, who cursed the King and changed him to a Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>(giant). The giant immediately killed Śakti. After many
<div n="lb"/>years Vasiṣṭha blessed the King and changed the form of
<div n="lb"/>the giant and gave him back his former shape. The King
<div n="lb"/>was delighted at having recovered his former shape. He
<div n="lb"/>took Vasiṣṭha to his palace. Madayantī the wife of the King
<div n="lb"/>with his permission went to Vasiṣṭha and got with child.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha returned to the forest. Even after the lapse of a
<div n="lb"/>long period she did not give birth to the child. Madayantī
<div n="lb"/>who was miserable at this, took an ‘aśman’ (a small
<div n="lb"/>cylindrical piece of the granite used to crush things placed
<div n="lb"/>on a flat square piece of granite) and crushed her stomach
<div n="lb"/>with it and she delivered a son. As he was born by using
<div n="lb"/>‘Aśma’ he was named Aśmaka. This King had built a
<div n="lb"/>city called Paudhanyā. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 176).
