AMBARĪṢA I¦. A King of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Viṣṇu was born in the
<div n="lb"/>following order: Brahmā-Marīci-Kaśyapa.-Vivasvān-
<div n="lb"/>Vaivasvatamanu-Ikṣvāku-Vikukṣi-Śaśāda-Purañjaya-
<div n="lb"/>Kukutstha-Anenas-Pṛthulāśva-Prasenajit-Yuvanāśva-
<div n="lb"/>Māndhātā-Ambarīṣa. Māndhātā had three sons: Amba-
<div n="lb"/>rīṣa, Mucukunda and Purukutsa and fifty daughters.
[Page029-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>The Muni (Sage) Saubhari married the daughters.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ambarīṣa's Yāga (sacrifice).%} In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>there is a story of Devendra's theft of the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>cow from Ambarīṣa's yāgaśālā. Devendra could not
<div n="lb"/>bear the thought of King Ambarīṣa winning world-
<div n="lb"/>renown and glory by performing yāgas. Therefore Indra
<div n="lb"/>stole the sacrificial cow and took it away. The Upā-
<div n="lb"/>dhyāya (Chief Priest) was alarmed at the disappear-
<div n="lb"/>ance of the cow and expressed his opinion to the King
<div n="lb"/>that it would be enough to sacrifice a human being in-
<div n="lb"/>stead of the cow. The King searched for the cow in all
<div n="lb"/>countries, cities and forests. At last he reached the
<div n="lb"/>peak of Bhṛgutuṅga where the sage Ṛcīka lived with
<div n="lb"/>his wife and children. The King explained to the sage
<div n="lb"/>the whole story. He requested him to sell one of his sons
<div n="lb"/>in exchange for 100,000 cows. Ṛcīka had three sons.
<div n="lb"/>The eldest was his father's favourite and the youngest
<div n="lb"/>was the mother's pet. In the end, Ṛcīka sold the second
<div n="lb"/>son, Śunaśśepha in return for 100,000 cows.
<div n="NI"/>On his return journey with Śunaśśepha the king rested
<div n="lb"/>for a while at Puṣkara Tīrtha. There Śunaśśepha
<div n="lb"/>happened to meet his uncle Viśvāmitra and complain-
<div n="lb"/>ed to him about his sad plight. Śunaśśepha's wish was
<div n="lb"/>that the king's yāga should be performed and at the same
<div n="lb"/>time his own life-span should be extended. Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>promised to save Śunaśśepha. He called Madhu-
<div n="lb"/>cchandas and his other sons and said to them: “One of
<div n="lb"/>you must take the place of Ambarīṣa's sacrificial cow
<div n="lb"/>and save the life of Śunaśśepha. God will bless you.”
<div n="NI"/>But none of the sons of Viśvāmitra was prepared to
<div n="lb"/>become the sacrificial cow. Viśvāmitra uttered a curse
<div n="lb"/>on his sons that they would have to spend a thousand
<div n="lb"/>years on earth, eating dog-flesh. Then he turned to
<div n="lb"/>Śunaśśepha and told him that if he prayed to the gods
<div n="lb"/>at the time of Ambarīṣa's yajña, they would save him.
<div n="NI"/>So Śunaśśepha went to Ambarīṣa's yāgaśālā. As
<div n="lb"/>ordered by the assembled guests, Ambarīṣa bound
<div n="lb"/>Śunaśśepha and had him dressed in blood-red robes,
<div n="lb"/>ready for the sacrifice. Śunaśśepha began to praise and
<div n="lb"/>pray to the gods. Soon Indra appeared and blessed him
<div n="lb"/>with longevity. He also rewarded Ambarīṣa for his
<div n="lb"/>yāga. Thus Śunaśśepha was saved.
<F>*) The story of Śunaśśepha may be seen with slight variations in the Devī Bhāgavata and other Purāṇas. In those versions, Śunaśśepha
<div n="lb"/>has been described as the sacrificial cow at Hariścandra's yāga, and moreover, Ajīgarta is referred to as the father of Śunaśśepha. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 58 gives the same story as in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).</F> (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 61).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ambarīṣa and Durvāsas.%} In Bhāgavata we see a story
<div n="lb"/>which describes how the Sudarśana Cakra which emerg-
<div n="lb"/>ed from Ambarīṣa's forehead chased Durvāsas in all
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds. Ambarīṣa was a devout worshipper of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. From the very beginning of his reign, peace and
<div n="lb"/>prosperity spread all over the country. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>who was pleased with the deep piety and devotion of
<div n="lb"/>Ambarīṣa appeared to him and bestowed on him the
<div n="lb"/>control of his (Viṣṇu's) Sudarśana Cakra. After that
<div n="lb"/>Ambarīṣa started the observance of Ekādaśī vrata.
<div n="lb"/>The rigour of the observance alarmed even Indra. He
<div n="lb"/>decided to obstruct the observance somehow or other. At
<div n="lb"/>that time, Durvāsas arrived in devaloka. Indra insti-
<div n="lb"/>gated Durvāsas to spoil the Ekādaśī observance of
<div n="lb"/>Ambarīṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Durvāsas went to Ambarīṣa's palace. There the King
<div n="lb"/>received him with due respect and sent him to the river
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī for his bath and morning rites. Durvāsas went
[Page030-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>for his bath and deliberately stayed away till the con-
<div n="lb"/>clusion of Ambarīṣa's Ekādaśī observance. At the end
<div n="lb"/>of the observance, after feeding the gods with his
<div n="lb"/>offerings, Ambarīṣa kept the remaining portion for
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas. After his bath etc., Durvāsas returned, but
<div n="lb"/>he was furious when he was offered the leavings of the
<div n="lb"/>food of the gods and refused to take any food. In his
<div n="lb"/>anger he advanced towards Ambarīṣa. A terrible mons-
<div n="lb"/>ter Kṛtyā emanated from the Maharṣi and was about
<div n="lb"/>to destroy Ambarīṣa. Ambarīṣa at once called upon
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana Cakra, which appeared instantly and after
<div n="lb"/>cutting the throat of Kṛtyā, turned against Durvāsas.
<div n="lb"/>Terrified by it, Durvāsas began to flee for life. The
<div n="lb"/>Cakra pursued him at his heels. Durvāsas went to Indra
<div n="lb"/>and sought refuge with him. But the Cakra followed
<div n="lb"/>him there. Indra pleaded helplessness. Then the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi went to Brahmā and sued for his help. There
<div n="lb"/>also the Cakra pursued him. Brahmā sent him to Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva was also unable to give him shelter. Sudarśana con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued to chase him. Durvāsas then sought shelter with
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu told him plainly that there was
<div n="lb"/>no alternative but to go and sue for mercy to Amba-
<div n="lb"/>rīṣa himself and advised him to do so. At last Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ambarīṣa and begged his pardon. Ambarīṣa
<div n="lb"/>saved him from Sudarśana Cakra and described to him
<div n="lb"/>the glory resulting from the observance of Ekādaśī
<div n="lb"/>vrata. (Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
