CAITRARATHA¦(M). A forest of purāṇic fame. Once
<div n="lb"/>King Yayāti enjoyed sexual acts with the apsaras
<div n="lb"/>Viśvācī in this forest. (Śloka 43, Chapter 75, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva). It was here in this forest that Pāṇḍu spent some
<div n="lb"/>days once with his wives Mādrī and Kuntī. (Śloka 48,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 118, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>As a support to the great mountain Mahāmeru were
<div n="lb"/>four mountains, Mandara, Merumandara, Supārśva
<div n="lb"/>and Kumuda. Above each of these was a garden-wood,
<div n="lb"/>Nandana, Caitraratha, Vaibhrājaka and Sarvatobhadra.
<div n="lb"/>Thus it is to be presumed that Caitraratha was on
<div n="lb"/>Merumandara. (Chapter 16, Pañcama Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
