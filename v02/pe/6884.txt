SŪCĪ¦ (NEEDLE). Iron needle is Purāṇically import-
<div n="lb"/>ant. There is a story connecting the iron-needle of
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata and Vibhīṣaṇa as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Having killed Rāvaṇa, Śrī Rāma anointed Vibhīṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>as the King of Laṅkā and returned to Ayodhyā. During
<div n="lb"/>the reign of Vibhīṣana, Laṅkā reached the highest stage
<div n="lb"/>of prosperity. Among the five metals, only gold
<div n="lb"/>was seen in Laṅkā. At this stage Vibhīṣaṇa got an iron
<div n="lb"/>needle from Bhārata. He kept it as a rare and valuable
<div n="lb"/>treasure, in his palace.
<div n="NI"/>Vibhīṣaṇa who was an ardent devotee of Śrī Rāma used
<div n="lb"/>to cross the sea, come to Rāmeśvara-temple and offer
<div n="lb"/>flower at the feet of Śrī Rāma, every day. Flower was
<div n="lb"/>brought in a big golden pot. Once Vibhīṣaṇa placed the
<div n="lb"/>golden pot in the courtyard of the temple and went in
<div n="lb"/>with the flower. After the worship, Vibhīṣaṇa came out
<div n="lb"/>and taking the pot on his head returned to Laṅkā. Being
<div n="lb"/>immersed in the thought of Śrī Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa did not
<div n="lb"/>look inside the pot. After reaching the palace he looked
<div n="lb"/>into the pot and saw a Brahmin sleeping in it. He was
<div n="lb"/>very pleased to see the Brahmin. So after welcoming
<div n="lb"/>him with hospitality, he brought the box in which he
<div n="lb"/>had kept the most precious treasure and placed it be-
<div n="lb"/>fore the Brahmin who returned with the box to Bhārata.
<div n="lb"/>He eagerly opened the box and saw only an iron needle
<div n="lb"/>in it. The consternation of the Brahmin need only be
<div n="lb"/>imagined.
