GHAṬA¦. A notorious thief. He had a friend called
<div n="lb"/>Karpara. They were jointly known as Ghāṭakarparas.
<div n="lb"/>Once both the friends went to commit theft. Leaving
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭa at the door-steps Karpara entered the chamber
<div n="lb"/>of the princess who after enjoying sexual pleasures
<div n="lb"/>with him gave him some money asking him to repeat
<div n="lb"/>such visits in future. Karpara told Ghaṭa all that had
<div n="lb"/>happened and handed over to him the money which the
<div n="lb"/>princess had given him. Karpara went again to the
<div n="lb"/>princess. But, owing to the weariness caused by the
<div n="lb"/>night's enjoyment both the princess and he slept till late
<div n="lb"/>in the morning. Meantime the palace guards found out
<div n="lb"/>the secret and took the lovers into custody. Karpara
<div n="lb"/>was sentenced to death and led out to be hanged. Ghaṭa
<div n="lb"/>was present on the spot and Karpara asked him secretly
<div n="lb"/>to save the princess. Accordingly Ghaṭa, without any-
<div n="lb"/>body knowing about it, took the princess over to his
<div n="lb"/>house.
<div n="NI"/>The King ordered enquiries about the absence of the
<div n="lb"/>princess. Under the natural presumption that some
<div n="lb"/>relation or other of Karpara alone might have carried
<div n="lb"/>away his daughter the King ordered the guards of Kar-
<div n="lb"/>para's corpse to arrest anybody who approached the
<div n="lb"/>corpse and expressed grief. Ghaṭa came to know of this
<div n="lb"/>secret order of the King. Next day evening Ghaṭa posing
<div n="lb"/>himself as a drunkard and with a servant disguised as
<F>1. According to certain Purānas Ghaṇṭākarṇas are two individuals, Ghaṇṭa and Karṇa. The term Ghaṇṭākarṇa—singular number—
<div n="lb"/>is used because the brothers were inseparable from each other.</F>

<div n="lb"/>a woman walking in front and with another servant
<div n="lb"/>carrying rice mixed with dhatūrā (a poisonous fruit)
<div n="lb"/>following him came to the guards keeping watch over
<div n="lb"/>Karpara's body. Ghaṭa gave the poisoned rice to the
<div n="lb"/>guards who after eating it swooned under the effect.
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭa used the opportunity to burn the corpse of
<div n="lb"/>Karpara there itself. After that Ghaṭa disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>The King then deputed new guards to watch over the
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre of Karpara as he anticipated some one to
<div n="lb"/>come to pick his charred bones from the pyre. But,
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭa put the guards into a swoon by a mantra he had
<div n="lb"/>learned from a sannyāsin and went away with the bones
<div n="lb"/>of his friend.
<div n="NI"/>Realising now that further stay there was not safe Ghaṭa
<div n="lb"/>left the place with the princess and the sannyāsin. But,
<div n="lb"/>the princess, who had already fallen in love with the
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsin poisoned Ghaṭa to death.
