UDAYANA¦. A renowned king of the Candravaṃśa (Lunar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There was a city called Kauśāmbī situated in
<div n="lb"/>the middle of the famous kingdom known as Vatsa in
<div n="lb"/>North India. The palace of king Śatānīka, born of the
<div n="lb"/>family of Arjuna, was in Kauśāmbī. Viṣṇumatī was the
<div n="lb"/>queen of Śatānīka. She had been childless. One day
<div n="lb"/>while Śatānīka was hunting in the forest, he met with
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Śāṇḍilya, by whose blessings Viṣṇumatī con-
<div n="lb"/>ceived and gave birth to a son. That son was Sahas-
<div n="lb"/>rānīka. When he came of age, Śatānīka left the country
<div n="lb"/>with his son and went to the heaven to help the gods
<div n="lb"/>in their battle with the Asuras, and he died there.
<div n="lb"/>Sahasrānīka became a mighty emperor. Once he got an
<div n="lb"/>invitation from Indra to go to heaven and help the
<div n="lb"/>gods to fight the Asuras. After having defeated the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, one day, he was walking with Indra in the
<div n="lb"/>Nandana Park, when he saw the gods playing with
<div n="lb"/>their wives in the park. Immediately the unmarried
<div n="lb"/>king became thoughtful and Indra read correctly, the
<div n="lb"/>reason for the sudden change in the king and said to the
<div n="lb"/>king. “Oh King! Don't be worried. A girl becoming
[Page801-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>you in every aspect, is born in the world. Her name is
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgāvatī.”
<div n="NI"/>Sahasrānīka was greatly pleased at this and he returned
<div n="lb"/>to the earth. In the chariot there were Tilottamā and
<div n="lb"/>the charioteer, with the king. The king who was deeply
<div n="lb"/>immersed in thinking about Mṛgāvatī, did not attend
<div n="lb"/>to the conversation of Tilottamā, who getting angry
<div n="lb"/>cursed him thus:-“May you be separated for fourteen
<div n="lb"/>years from the person whose thought has prevented
<div n="lb"/>you from attending to what I have been telling you.”
<div n="NI"/>The king married Mṛgāvatī. She became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>One day she told the king about her desire to dip in a
<div n="lb"/>pond of blood. The king got a pond ready, filled with
<div n="lb"/>the juice of Lākṣā (a kind of wax, the boiled water of
<div n="lb"/>which will look like blood) and such other things. Mṛgā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī began to dip and splash in the pond of blood.
<div n="lb"/>When she was dipping under the juice, taking her to be
<div n="lb"/>a large piece of flesh, an eagle took her from the pond
<div n="lb"/>and flew away. The king was overwhelmed with grief
<div n="lb"/>and fell down. Then the charioteer came down from
<div n="lb"/>heaven and informed the king of the curse of Tilottamā,
<div n="lb"/>and then he returned.
<div n="NI"/>The eagle left Mṛgāvatī in the mount of the Rising Sun
<div n="lb"/>and flew away. She cried aloud. A huge snake neared
<div n="lb"/>her to swallow her. Then a divine person appeared
<div n="lb"/>there and saved her from the snake and vanished. Then
<div n="lb"/>a hermit-boy came there and asked the lonely woman,
<div n="lb"/>clad in only one garment, about her story and took her
<div n="lb"/>to the hermitage of the hermit Jamadagni who blessed
<div n="lb"/>her. After some days she gave birth to a son. At that
<div n="lb"/>time an unknown voice was heard saying “This boy
<div n="lb"/>would become the most renowned king Udayana and
<div n="lb"/>his son would become the supreme Lord of the Vidyā-
<div n="lb"/>dharas.” Because he was born in the Udayādri (the
<div n="lb"/>mount of the Rising Sun) he got the name Udayana.
<div n="lb"/>The boy Udayana grew up in the hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Udayana to his father.%} The hermit Jamadagani who
<div n="lb"/>knew the past, present and the future performed all the
<div n="lb"/>rituals, necessary for a boy of Kṣatriya caste (kingly
<div n="lb"/>race) such as Caula, Upanayana etc. and gave him
<div n="lb"/>education in every branch of knowledge. Because of her
<div n="lb"/>love and regard for her son, Mṛgāvatī put on his arm a
<div n="lb"/>bangle with the name Sahasrānīka inscribed in it,
<div n="lb"/>which she had been wearing so long. One day, while
<div n="lb"/>Udayana was walking through the forest, he saw a
<div n="lb"/>snake-charmer catching a snake. He felt sorry for the
<div n="lb"/>snake. So he gave the bangle to the snake-charmer and
<div n="lb"/>set the snake free. When the snake charmer was gone,
<div n="lb"/>the snake told Udayana its story. That serpent was
<div n="lb"/>Vasunemi, the elder brother of Vāsuki. Out of grati-
<div n="lb"/>tude the serpent gave Udayana the famous Lute
<div n="lb"/>Ghoṣavatī and betels and taught him the art of making
<div n="lb"/>garlands and marks on the forehead which would never
<div n="lb"/>fade.
<div n="NI"/>The snake-charmer took the bangle to the capital for sale.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the name of the king inscribed on it, the king's
<div n="lb"/>men took him before the king. He told the king every-
<div n="lb"/>thing. The king who had been suffering for the last four-
<div n="lb"/>teen years form the pangs of separation, started for the
<div n="lb"/>mount of the Rising Sun, without any loss of time. The
<div n="lb"/>hermit Jamadagni gave him his wife Mṛgāvatī and son
<div n="lb"/>Udayana. They all returned to Kauśāmbī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The anointment of Udayana.%} Sahasrānīka anointed his
<div n="lb"/>son Udayana as the heir to his throne, and appointed
<div n="lb"/>Yaugandharāyaṇa, Rumanvān and Vasantaka, the sons
[Page802-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of three ministers, as ministers of Udayana. At the time
<div n="lb"/>of the anointment there was a shower of flowers
<div n="lb"/>from the sky and an unknown voice said “With the help
<div n="lb"/>of these ministers Udayana would bring the whole of
<div n="lb"/>the earth under his control.” After a time Sahasrānīka
<div n="lb"/>went to the Himālayas with his wife for penance.
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Vāsavadattā became Udayana's wife.%} A daughter was
<div n="lb"/>born to the king of Ujjayinī. Her name was Vāsava-
<div n="lb"/>dattā. Her father Caṇḍamahāsena decided to give her
<div n="lb"/>in marriage to Udayana the king of Vatsa. How to
<div n="lb"/>bring this to pass? Caṇḍamahāsena and Udayana had
<div n="lb"/>been enemies. Finally he found out a way. It was
<div n="lb"/>to entrust Vāsavadattā to Udayana (who was a great
<div n="lb"/>teacher of music) for teaching her music. Ultimately he
<div n="lb"/>would fall in love with her and thus Udayana would
<div n="lb"/>become his son-in-law. This was the plan.
<div n="NI"/>King Caṇḍamahāsena sent a messenger to Kauśāmbī.
<div n="lb"/>The messenger was sent back with a reply that, if his
<div n="lb"/>daughter was sent to Kauśāmbī, he would teach her
<div n="lb"/>music. Caṇḍamahāsena did not like this. So he decided
<div n="lb"/>to take Udayana a prisoner somehow or other. The
<div n="lb"/>king had an elephant called Naḍāgiri. He ordered for
<div n="lb"/>an artificial elephant to be made equal in size to
<div n="lb"/>Naḍāgiri, and placed some soldiers inside the elephant.
<div n="lb"/>The artificial elephant with soldiers inside it was taken
<div n="lb"/>to the great forest in the Vindhya mountain and placed
<div n="lb"/>there. The men of Udayana saw this elephant and
<div n="lb"/>reported it to the king. Udayana decided to see the huge
<div n="lb"/>elephant which had appeared in the Vindhya. Udayana
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest and saw the huge elephant standing
<div n="lb"/>at a distance. The king found out a plan to catch it.
<div n="lb"/>Playing mild notes on his lute, the king alone neared
<div n="lb"/>the elephant. As the night was drawing and as
<div n="lb"/>he was immersed in music, he did not understand that
<div n="lb"/>it was an artificial elephant. As the king was nearing
<div n="lb"/>the elephant it went on retreating, and thus got the
<div n="lb"/>king away from his men. Then the soldiers got out of
<div n="lb"/>the elephant, surrounded the king and took him a
<div n="lb"/>prisoner. Thus Udayana began to live in the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍamahāsena. His work was to teach Vāsavadattā
<div n="lb"/>music.
<div n="NI"/>The news reached Kauśāmbī. Yaugandharāyaṇa entrust-
<div n="lb"/>ed the affairs of the government to Rumaṇvān and
<div n="lb"/>started for Ujjayinī with Vasantaka. At Ujjayinī they
<div n="lb"/>got Yogeśvara, a Brahmarākṣasa as friend. According
<div n="lb"/>to his advice Yaugandharāyaṇa took the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>mad old man. Vasantaka adopted the guise of a sick
<div n="lb"/>man, suffering from pain in the stomach an uncouth
<div n="lb"/>figure to look at. They entered the city. The madness of
<div n="lb"/>Yaugandharāyaṇa was an entertainment to the people.
<div n="lb"/>The ladies of the court liked him much. Vāsavadattā
<div n="lb"/>invited the madman to the harem. Udayana instantly
<div n="lb"/>recognized the mad man. Vasantaka also got admittance
<div n="lb"/>to the palace. He told Vāsavadattā the story of Loha-
<div n="lb"/>jaṅgha in an interesting way. (See under Lohajaṅgha)
<div n="lb"/>Vāsavadattā began to be drawn more and more towards
<div n="lb"/>Udayana. She seemed to have forgotten even about the
<div n="lb"/>fact that her father was an enemy of Udayana, who
<div n="lb"/>had been thinking seriously of means of escape from
<div n="lb"/>the palace. Vāsavadattā agreed to accompany him.
<div n="lb"/>Āṣādhaka got Bhadrāvatī, the elephant of Vāsavadattā,
<div n="lb"/>ready for the flight. In the night Udayana and his
<div n="lb"/>retinue got on the elephant Bhadrāvatī and fled from
<div n="lb"/>the palace. Kāñcanamālā the maid of Vāsavadattā
<div n="lb"/>also accompanied her mistress. When they had passed
[Page802-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the Vindhya mountain the elephant Bhadrāvatī fell
<div n="lb"/>dead. When they all were standing around the dead
<div n="lb"/>elephant sadly, they heard an ethereal voice saying, “Oh
<div n="lb"/>King! I am a Vidyādhara woman called Māyāvatī. I
<div n="lb"/>had been an elephant for so long. The son you are
<div n="lb"/>going to get, will also be helped by me. Your wife
<div n="lb"/>Vāsavadattā also, is a goddess, born as a woman
<div n="lb"/>purposely.” Next day, all reached the palace of Udayana
<div n="lb"/>and the marriage of Udayana and Vāsavadattā took
<div n="lb"/>place shortly. Caṇḍamahāsena recognized that marri-
<div n="lb"/>age.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Udayana's marriage with Padmāvatī.%} Udayana spent
<div n="lb"/>his days with Vāsavadattā in the harem. The ministers
<div n="lb"/>Yaugandharāyaṇa, Rumaṇvān, Vasantaka and others
<div n="lb"/>thought that the behaviour of the King was detrimental
<div n="lb"/>to the well-being of the country. They wanted to re-
<div n="lb"/>move the King from the palace for a little while and
<div n="lb"/>to form an alliance with the powerful King of Magadha.
<div n="lb"/>By a marriage alliance all these could be achieved. The
<div n="lb"/>King of Magadha had a beautiful daughter called
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī. The ministers began to work with this end
<div n="lb"/>in view.
<div n="NI"/>Once Yaugandharāyaṇa took Udayana to the forest of
<div n="lb"/>Lāvāṇaka and stayed there. It was reported to the
<div n="lb"/>King of Magadha that the King of Vatsa was drawing
<div n="lb"/>near to his kingdom. Fearing an attack from Udayana,
<div n="lb"/>the King of Magadha began to think of concluding a
<div n="lb"/>treaty with Vatsa. The King of Vatsa used to go for
<div n="lb"/>hunting everyday. One day he went to a distant place
<div n="lb"/>for hunting, and the minister went to the house of
<div n="lb"/>Vāsavadattā and informed her of their plans. Though
<div n="lb"/>it was not at all palatable to her, she gave her consent
<div n="lb"/>and agreed to help them as it was meant for the well-
<div n="lb"/>being of the King and the country. Accordingly,
<div n="lb"/>Yaugandharāyaṇa took the guise of an old Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>Vāsavadattā that of a young Brahmin lady and Vasan-
<div n="lb"/>taka that of a Brahmin celibate with only one eye.
<div n="lb"/>They went to the kingdom of Magadha. Rumaṇvān
<div n="lb"/>set fire to the house of Vāsavadattā and spread the
<div n="lb"/>rumour that Vāsavadattā and Vasantaka had been
<div n="lb"/>burnt to death. Yaugandharāyaṇa, Vāsavadattā and
<div n="lb"/>Vasantaka reached Magadha. They got into the capital
<div n="lb"/>and saw Padmāvatī sitting in the garden. The old
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin conversed with the princess for a while. She
<div n="lb"/>enquired about the young woman who was with him.
<div n="lb"/>The old Brahmin replied thus:—“She is my daughter
<div n="lb"/>Avantikā. Her husband has left the country. I request
<div n="lb"/>you to keep her with you till I find him out and bring
<div n="lb"/>him here. She may not like to be separated from her
<div n="lb"/>people. So let her brother, the celibate, also be here
<div n="lb"/>with her.”
<div n="NI"/>Padmāvatī took them with gladness and Yaugandharā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, bidding farewell, returned to the forest Lāvāṇaka.
<div n="lb"/>Avantikā and the Celibate lived in the palace with
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī. Vāsavadattā who had learned from Udayana
<div n="lb"/>the art of making garlands ans marks on the forehead
<div n="lb"/>which would not fade, had prepared them for Padmā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī.
<div n="NI"/>The King of Vatsa returned to the forest Lāvāṇaka
<div n="lb"/>and found the house of his wife burnt down to ashes.
<div n="lb"/>He fell unconscious when he heard that Vāsavadattā
<div n="lb"/>and Vasantaka had been burnt to death.
<div n="NI"/>The spies of the King of Magadha who were in the
<div n="lb"/>forest of Lāvāṇaka, reported the rumour about the
[Page803-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>death of Vāsavadattā and Vasantaka to their King in
<div n="lb"/>Magadha, who wished to give his daughter Padmāvatī
<div n="lb"/>in marriage to Udayana. The marriage proposal was
<div n="lb"/>accepted by Udayana and wearing garlands and marks
<div n="lb"/>that would not fade Padmāvatī entered the wedding
<div n="lb"/>dais. Udayana married Padmāvatī. Yaugandharāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>made the King of Magadha take an oath that he would
<div n="lb"/>go for no more aggression. Udayana and his people
<div n="lb"/>reached Kauśāmbī. On the way the King happened to
<div n="lb"/>see the mark on the forehead and the garland on the
<div n="lb"/>neck of Padmāvatī and asked her who had made them.
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī told the King the story of Avantikā.
<div n="lb"/>Udayana was definite that Avantikā was Vāsavadattā
<div n="lb"/>herself. Avantikā was brought before the King. Padmā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī congratulated Vāsavadattā. Both of them loved
<div n="lb"/>each other and lived together as the loving wives of
<div n="lb"/>Udayana. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Udayana gets a new throne.%} Once Udayana was
<div n="lb"/>sitting in the court-hall, when a Brahmin came there
<div n="lb"/>and made a complaint to the King that some cow-
<div n="lb"/>herds had broken the legs of his son. The Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>said that a boy named Devasena sat on a stone in the
<div n="lb"/>forest and instantly he got kingly power. The leg of the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin boy was broken by the friends of Devasena
<div n="lb"/>because he did not bow before Devasena.
<div n="NI"/>When he heard the story, the minister Yaugandharā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa said that that place must have some peculiarities.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly the men of the King dug the place. He
<div n="lb"/>got a throne of gems. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalam-
<div n="lb"/>baka).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The son of Udayana.%} Vāsavadattā became pregnant
<div n="lb"/>and gave birth to a child. He was named Naravāhana-
<div n="lb"/>datta. Nārada granted him a boon that Naravāhana-
<div n="lb"/>datta would become the emperor of the Vidyādharas.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Naravāhanadatta).
<div n="NI"/>The princess of Takṣaśilā named Kaliṅgasenā fell in
<div n="lb"/>love with Udayana and she came to Kauśāmbī. But no
<div n="lb"/>marriage took place. (See under Kaliṅgasenā). Nara-
<div n="lb"/>vāhanadatta, the son of Udayana, married Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañcukā who was the incarnation of Rati Devī (the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Madana). Udayana entrusted the country
<div n="lb"/>to his son and led a life of retirement with his wives.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara).
