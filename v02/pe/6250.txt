SAPTAMĀTṚ¦(S). (SEVEN MOTHERS).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Saptamātṛs are the seven
<div n="lb"/>goddesses named Brahmāṇī, Vaiṣṇavī, Māheśvarī,
<div n="lb"/>Kaumārī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī and Cāmuṇḍī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} Some are of opinion that the Saptamātṛs
<div n="lb"/>are connected with Śiva. Their names reveal that they
<div n="lb"/>were born from the bodies of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and such
<div n="lb"/>other gods. There is another story that when Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu joined together and tried to kill the asura named
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka and failed, they created the seven mothers to
<div n="lb"/>kill the asura. From each drop of blood of Andhakāsura
<div n="lb"/>that fell on the ground an asura arose. These seven
<div n="lb"/>mātṛs joined with Yogeśvarī, the creation of Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>drank the blood of the asura without allowing it to
<div n="lb"/>fall on the ground and so it became easy for Śiva to
<div n="lb"/>kill the asura.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 56,
<div n="lb"/>about the birth of the Saptamātṛs, as follows: In
<div n="lb"/>olden days a fierce war broke out between the devas
<div n="lb"/>and the asuras. When the fierce asuras Caṇḍa and
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍa were killed the famous asura named Raktabīja
[Page691-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>entered the battlefield with an akṣauhiṇī of army
<div n="lb"/>(21870 chariots, so many elephants, 65610 horses and
<div n="lb"/>109350 infantry). Seeing this immense army of the
<div n="lb"/>asuras drawing near, Kauśikī, Maheśvarī and Kālīmade
<div n="lb"/>a loud roaring sound. Then from the mouth of
<div n="lb"/>Maheśvarī, Brahmāṇī came out seated on a swan and
<div n="lb"/>wearing rosary and water pot. From her eyes Maheś-
<div n="lb"/>varī with three eyes came out seated on a bull and
<div n="lb"/>wearing great snakes as bangles and ear-rings and
<div n="lb"/>holding a trident. From the loins came out Kaumārī,
<div n="lb"/>seated on a peacock and holding a lance. The beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful Vaiṣṇavī came out from her hand, seated on
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa, holding a conch, discus, club, sword, the bow
<div n="lb"/>śārṅga and arrow. From her posterior came out the
<div n="lb"/>horrible Vārāhī (Boar) with a great pestle, seated on
<div n="lb"/>the Nāga (serpent) Śeṣa, and furrowing the ground
<div n="lb"/>with her fierce tusks. From her heart came out the
<div n="lb"/>awful Nārasiṃhī (woman-lion) with fierce claws, who
<div n="lb"/>at the shaking of her mane displaced the planets and
<div n="lb"/>the stars, and from her foot Cāmuṇḍī came out. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Palālā).
