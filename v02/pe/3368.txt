KĀRTAVĪRYĀRJUNA¦ (KĀRTAVĪRYA). A renowned
<div n="lb"/>King of the Hehaya dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Mahāviṣṇu were descended in the
<div n="lb"/>following order: Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purū-
<div n="lb"/>ravas—Āyus—Yayāti—Yadu—Sahasrajit—Śatajit—
<div n="lb"/>Ekavīra—(Hehaya)—Dharma—Kaṇi—Bhadrasena—
<div n="lb"/>Dhanaka—Kṛtavīrya—Kārtavīryārjuna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Hehaya Dynasty and Bhārgava Dynasty.%} The Hehayas
<div n="lb"/>were Kṣatriyas and the Bhārgavas were Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="lb"/>The Bhārgava sages were the family preceptors of the
<div n="lb"/>Hehaya Kings. The Hehayas who were generous and
<div n="lb"/>charitable, used to give plenty of wealth to the Bhārga-
<div n="lb"/>vas. Consequently in course of time, the Bhārgavas
<div n="lb"/>grew wealthy while the Hehayas gradually declined. In
<div n="lb"/>order to tide over their difficulty, the Hehayas decided
<div n="lb"/>to borrow some money from the Bhārgavas. But the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgavas refused to oblige, on the plea that they had
<div n="lb"/>no money. The enraged Kṣatriyas (Hehayas) began to
<div n="lb"/>persecute the Bhṛgus (Bhārgavas). The Bhṛgus left for
<div n="lb"/>the Himālayas after burying all their treasures under
<div n="lb"/>the floor of their Āśramas. The Kṣatriyas pursued
<div n="lb"/>them and hunted them even there. At last a Brāhmaṇī
<div n="lb"/>who belonged to the Bhārgava race, gave birth to a
<div n="lb"/>sage named Aurva through her thigh. With his birth
<div n="lb"/>the Hehayas began to lead a less aggressive life. After
<div n="lb"/>the lapse of many years, the mighty Kārtavīryārjuna
<div n="lb"/>was born in the Hehaya dynasty and the mighty sage
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni was born in the Bhṛgu dynasty. Both of
<div n="lb"/>them nourished their hereditary feud. With his capital
<div n="lb"/>in the city of Māhiṣmatī on the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā, Kārtavīryārjuna began his reign. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Aurva I).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Thousand Hands of Kārtavīryārjuna.%} Once when
<div n="lb"/>Kārtavīryārjuna was living in his capital Māhiṣmatī,
<div n="lb"/>the sage Nārada happened to come there. The King
<div n="lb"/>greeted him with due reverence and asked him what
<div n="lb"/>course of action was to be followed for attaining
<div n="lb"/>mokṣa (salvation) and at the same time for enjoying
<div n="lb"/>worldly pleasures. Nārada replied that by performing
<div n="lb"/>the rite known as “Bhadradīpa Pratiṣṭhā”, both these
<div n="lb"/>objects could be achieved. Accordingly, Kārtavīrya
<div n="lb"/>went to the banks of the river Narmadā with his wife
[Page394-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and began the observance of Bhadradīpa Pratiṣṭhā.
<div n="lb"/>Kārtavīrya's guru was Dattātreya, the son of Atri. At
<div n="lb"/>the conclusion of the Yāga rites, Dattātreya who was
<div n="lb"/>pleased, asked Kārtavīryārjuna what boons he wished
<div n="lb"/>to have. Kārtavīrya with joined palms asked him many
<div n="lb"/>boons one of which was that he should have a thousand
<div n="lb"/>arms. Dattātreya granted him the boons, and Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya who became proud of his new possession, ruled at
<div n="lb"/>Māhiṣmatī for 86, 000 years. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Vāyu's Warning.%} Kārtavīryārjuna who returned
<div n="lb"/>triumphant after receiving the boon from Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>heard a mysterious voice warning him in the following
<div n="lb"/>words:—“You fool! Don't you know that a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>is superior to a Kṣatriya? A Kṣatriya governs his
<div n="lb"/>subjects in alliance with the Brāhmaṇa”. On hearing
<div n="lb"/>this, Kārtavīrya became angry. He understood that
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu, the divine messenger was behind the mysterious
<div n="lb"/>voice. He despised Vāyu and argued that a Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>was superior to a Brāhmaṇa. Vāyu gave him a warn-
<div n="lb"/>ing that a Brāhmaṇa would curse Kārtavīrya. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 152).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kārtavīrya cursed by the sage.%} Once Agni (fire-god)
<div n="lb"/>approached Kārtavīrya and begged for food. The King
<div n="lb"/>allowed him to feed upon mountains and trees from any
<div n="lb"/>part of his Kingdom. So Agni began to devour the
<div n="lb"/>woods and hills. This led to the burning down of an
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama owned by a sage called Āpava. The enraged
<div n="lb"/>Sage came to know that Kārtavīryārjuna was respon-
<div n="lb"/>sible for the havoc and pronounced a curse that Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma would chop off all the thousand hands of Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kārtavīryārjuna and Rāvaṇa.%} In the course of his
<div n="lb"/>triumphal march, after conquering the whole world,
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa once arrived with his forces on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river Narmadā. Enjoying the smooth flow of the crystal
<div n="lb"/>clear stream of the Narmadā and the pleasant sand
<div n="lb"/>banks in the river-bed, he spent a night there with his
<div n="lb"/>followers. Early next morning he took his bath in the
<div n="lb"/>river and setting up the idol of Śiva on the sand bank,
<div n="lb"/>began to worship it.
<div n="NI"/>Just then Kārtavīryārjuna and his wives came to the
<div n="lb"/>place and began their water sports, a few yards down
<div n="lb"/>the river from the place where Rāvaṇa was sitting. As
<div n="lb"/>part of his amusements, Kārtavīrya stopped the flow of
<div n="lb"/>the river by making a dam with his thousand arms.
<div n="lb"/>This caused the level of the water to rise and Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>with his materials of worship was submerged in the
<div n="lb"/>flood. Enraged at this disturbance to his worship, he
<div n="lb"/>sent two of his men down the river bank to find out
<div n="lb"/>what was happening. They traced the source of the
<div n="lb"/>trouble to Kārtavīryārjuna and his water-sports and
<div n="lb"/>reported the matter to their master. At once Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>armed himself with his bow rushed to Kārtavīryārjuna
<div n="lb"/>and began a fierce fight. At last Rāvaṇa fell down under
<div n="lb"/>the heavy stroke of Kārtavīrya's mace and was bound
<div n="lb"/>in chains and imprisoned. He lay there for one year.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's father sage Pulastya came to know of this and
<div n="lb"/>he went to Kārtavīrya's palace. He was received with
<div n="lb"/>due respect and at his request, Kārtavīrya released
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and after that they remained friends for life.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kārtavīrya and Reṇukā's Death.%} One day when
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma was fourteen years old, his father sage
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni went to the forest to fetch some Samits
[Page394-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>(sacrificial twigs). Jamadagni's wife, Reṇukā swept and
<div n="lb"/>cleaned the Āśrama and went to the river Revā to fetch
<div n="lb"/>water and Paraśurāma was left behind in the Āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>When she reached the river bank, she saw Kārtavīryārjuna
<div n="lb"/>indulging in amorous pleasures with his wives in the
<div n="lb"/>water. She waited unobserved on the bank for some
<div n="lb"/>time and after they had left the place, she stepped into
<div n="lb"/>the river. But since the water was muddy, she had to
<div n="lb"/>go to another place in the river to get clear water.
<div n="lb"/>There also she lingered for a few minutes, looking at
<div n="lb"/>the amorous amusements of Citraratha, King of Sālva,
<div n="lb"/>with his wives. It was only after they had departed
<div n="lb"/>that she was able to return to the Āśrama with water.
<div n="lb"/>Meanwhile Jamadagni who had returned to the Āśrama
<div n="lb"/>earlier was angry at her delay and was waiting impatient-
<div n="lb"/>ly for her arrival. As soon as she reached the Āśrama,
<div n="lb"/>the sage, in a fit of fury, ordered Paraśurāma to cut
<div n="lb"/>off her head and the latter obeyed him. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The Triumphal March of Kārtavīrya.%} All the Kings in
<div n="lb"/>the world acknowledged the supremacy of Kārtavīrya.
<div n="lb"/>In Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 16, we find that Kings
<div n="lb"/>of the Solar dynasty like Trayyāruṇa, Hariścandra,
<div n="lb"/>Rohitāśva and Cuñcu were defeated by Kārtavīryā-
<div n="lb"/>rjuna. In his golden chariot he went about defeating
<div n="lb"/>Devas, Yakṣas, Ṛṣis and others. He challenged even
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. He insulted Indra in the company of Indrāṇī.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 115).
<div n="NI"/>Intoxicated by his successes, Kārtavīrya went to the
<div n="lb"/>sea-shore and challenged the ocean and began to des-
<div n="lb"/>troy the animals in the sea by shooting them with his
<div n="lb"/>arrows. God Varuṇa appeared before him and asked
<div n="lb"/>him what he wanted. Kārtavīrya asked the god to
<div n="lb"/>name a man who had the capacity to fight with him.
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa answered that Jamadagni's son Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>was the person who satisfied that condition. Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya accepted the challenge and went in search of
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 29).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Killing of Jamadagni.%} Once Kārtavīrya went to
<div n="lb"/>hunt in the forest with his followers. They were roam-
<div n="lb"/>ing in the Vindhya forests in search of game. At noon
<div n="lb"/>after a refreshing bath in the clear waters of the river
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā when they were preparing to return, they
<div n="lb"/>saw Jamadagni's Āśrama. After asking his men to wait
<div n="lb"/>at the river-bank, Kārtavīrya went alone to the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama. He paid his respects to the sage and after
<div n="lb"/>their usual greetings, Jamadagni asked him to call his
<div n="lb"/>followers also to the Āśrama. When all of them arrived
<div n="lb"/>the sage gave them a sumptuous feast. Kārtavīrya
<div n="lb"/>wondered how the sage managed to do it. They spent
<div n="lb"/>the night there and when they returned home next
<div n="lb"/>morning Kārtavīrya's minister Candragupta told him
<div n="lb"/>that he saw a cow in Jamadagni's Āśrama and that it
<div n="lb"/>was from that divine cow that the sage was able to get
<div n="lb"/>all the rare articles of food which he supplied to the
<div n="lb"/>guests. He also offered to get the cow from the sage.
<div n="lb"/>So the King sent Candragupta to the Āśrama to beg
<div n="lb"/>the cow from the sage for him. Candragupta accordingly
<div n="lb"/>went with a few followers to the Āśrama and begged
<div n="lb"/>for the cow. At that time Paraśurāma was not in the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama. Jamadagni told them that the cow was
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu's sister, Suśīlā and that it was not possible
<div n="lb"/>to give her. Candragupta tried to seize the cow by
<div n="lb"/>force but she suddenly vanished into the sky. The
<div n="lb"/>King's men tried to capture her calf. Jamadagni who
[Page395-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>came forward to prevent them, was beaten to death by
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters 67 to
<div n="lb"/>70).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Jamadagni's Restoration to Life.%} Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>returned soon to the Āśrama with the disciple Akṛta-
<div n="lb"/>vraṇa. At the sight of his father lying dead on the floor,
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma cried aloud. Reṇukā beat her breast
<div n="lb"/>twentyone times. Seeing this, Paraśurāma took a
<div n="lb"/>solemn vow that he would go round the world twenty-
<div n="lb"/>one times and extirpate the Kṣatriya Kings. The sage
<div n="lb"/>Śukra appeared there with Suśīlā who had vanished.
<div n="lb"/>After restoring Jamadagni to life Śukra went back.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Death of Kārtavīryārjuna.%} Paraśu Rāma who had
<div n="lb"/>turned himself into the very embodiment of Revenge,
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by Akṛtavraṇa, took his stand at the gates
<div n="lb"/>of the city of Māhiṣmatī and challenged Kārtavīr-
<div n="lb"/>yārjuna to a fight. Kārtavīrya came out with a huge
<div n="lb"/>army. In the terrible fight that followed, Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>himself with his axe (paraśu) chopped off all the
<div n="lb"/>thousand arms of Kārtavīryārjuna. All his sons were
<div n="lb"/>killed. Kārtavīrya himself fell down beheaded. This
<div n="lb"/>was the end of the pillar of Hehaya dynasty. (Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>ṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 81).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Kārtavīrya's sons.%} Kārtavirya had one hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons. All of them were killed in the battle by Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma. Their names, as given in Chapter 76 of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, are given below:—
