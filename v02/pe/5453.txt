PŪJĀVIDHI¦. Chapter 155 of Agni Purāṇa states the
<div n="lb"/>various acts of worship that should be done daily
<div n="lb"/>and they are the acts of worship observed by all
<div n="lb"/>brahmacārins during the time of Manusmṛti.
<div n="NI"/>You should rise up at Brāhmamuhūrta. Finish your ex-
<div n="lb"/>cretory routine sitting facing north during daytime and
<div n="lb"/>facing south during night time. If it is at dusk or dawn
<div n="lb"/>it should be done as during day time. It should never
<div n="lb"/>be done in public roads, water or grass. Wash with
<div n="lb"/>sand after your excretions and then wash your teeth.
<div n="lb"/>After that take your bath. Baths are of six kinds: Nitya-
<div n="lb"/>snāna, Naimittikasnāna, Kāmyasnāna, Kriyāṅgasnāna,
<div n="lb"/>Malakarṣaṇasnāna and Kriyāsnāna. Any religious act
<div n="lb"/>done without a bath is of no use. Therefore you should
<div n="lb"/>bathe early. Well-water is good for bathing, water from
<div n="lb"/>a fountain is better, water of a lake is much better,
<div n="lb"/>river-water is still better and water of a tīrtha
[Page611-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>is still better. The water of the river Gaṅgā is the
<div n="lb"/>best.
<div n="NI"/>After washing after excretions you should enter into
<div n="lb"/>the waters and wash again and then wash your body.
<div n="lb"/>While washing you should recite the following mantras
<div n="lb"/>“Hiraṇyavarṇaḥ, Śanno devīḥ, āpo hi ṣṭhā and idam-
<div n="lb"/>āpaḥ.” You should submerge yourself in the waters and
<div n="lb"/>recite the mantras there under the water. You should
<div n="lb"/>also recite Aghamarṣaṇa sūkta or the Ṛk named
<div n="lb"/>Drupada. Gāyatrī should be chanted specially. After
<div n="lb"/>the Japa you should rub dry with a cloth your head
<div n="lb"/>and body and then offer water to the devas and manes.
<div n="lb"/>Then you should worship with water reciting Puruṣa-
<div n="lb"/>sūkta.
<div n="NI"/>You should give way to anybody carrying a load, a
<div n="lb"/>pregnant woman and preceptors. Never look at the
<div n="lb"/>Sun at the time of rising or setting. Never look at the
<div n="lb"/>reflection of the moon in waters. Never look at a nude
<div n="lb"/>woman. Do not peep into a well. Never trample over
<div n="lb"/>clothes and sacred ashes. Never enter the bedroom or
<div n="lb"/>the treasure room of another man. Those who rub mud
<div n="lb"/>blocks against mud block, cut their teeth or bite their
<div n="lb"/>nails will perish. Never enter a house through any
<div n="lb"/>other opening than its proper gate. Never interrupt
<div n="lb"/>when others are talking. Never use the clothes of ano-
<div n="lb"/>ther man. Tell everybody ‘Bhadram’ ‘Bhadram’ (well
<div n="lb"/>well). Never speak to displease anybody. Never walk
<div n="lb"/>on the shadow of an individual. Do not pass through
<div n="lb"/>the space between two respectable persons sitting and
<div n="lb"/>talking. Do not look at falling stars. Never mention
<div n="lb"/>the name of another river while in a river. Do not
<div n="lb"/>scratch your body with both your hands. Never cross a
<div n="lb"/>river before offering water to the devas and manes. Do
<div n="lb"/>not throw your excretions into the waters. Never
<div n="lb"/>bathe naked. After bath you should pray to gods for
<div n="lb"/>your welfare. Never take out a garland from your body
<div n="lb"/>by yourself. Avoid dust from the hooves of donkeys
<div n="lb"/>sticking to your body. Never laugh at low-caste people,
<div n="lb"/>nor live with them nor live in their places. Never live
<div n="lb"/>in a place where there are no rivers, doctors or a king.
<div n="lb"/>Nor live in a place ruled by barbarous people or a
<div n="lb"/>woman or by a number of people together. Never
<div n="lb"/>talk with women during their period of menses. If you
<div n="lb"/>have talked with them think of Viṣṇu. Never laugh,
<div n="lb"/>sneeze or yawn without covering your mouth. Wise
<div n="lb"/>man should hide the disgrace to one superior to him-
<div n="lb"/>self and protect the words of the superior or his own.
<div n="lb"/>Never encourage too much activity of the senses nor
<div n="lb"/>should you check the pressure of excretions. Do not
<div n="lb"/>belittle even the smallest of ailments or the smallest of
<div n="lb"/>enemies. If you walk through public roads you should
<div n="lb"/>wash yourself. Never walk bearing water or fire. Do
<div n="lb"/>not hiss in the presence of respectable and virtuous
<div n="lb"/>people. Do not place one leg over the other leg. Never
<div n="lb"/>speak directly or indirectly things which are unpleasant
<div n="lb"/>to others. Avoid contempt of Vedas, Kings, sages,
<div n="lb"/>science and devas. Do not be jealous of women nor do
<div n="lb"/>place confidence in them. Always listen to virtuous talks,
<div n="lb"/>be devoted to the gods and observe righteous acts daily.
<div n="lb"/>On your birthday worship the moon, gods and brahmins.
<div n="lb"/>Never take an oil bath on the fourth (caturthī), sixth
<div n="lb"/>(ṣaṣṭhī) and eighth (aṣṭamī) days of lunar fortnight.
<div n="lb"/>Throw away your excretions far away from home.
<div n="lb"/>Never be unfriendly with venerable and noble
<div n="lb"/>people.
