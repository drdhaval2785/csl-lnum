<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous birth and kingship.%} In Padmapurāṇa, Part
<div n="lb"/>III, Chapter 10, there is a story stating how the
<div n="lb"/>seven sons of Kauśika, a hermit, became fishermen by
<div n="lb"/>a curse and how they got absolution and attainment
<div n="lb"/>of heaven by offering oblations to the manes. The
<div n="lb"/>story is given below. Brahmadatta was the rebirth of
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛvartti, one of those seven sons.
<div n="NI"/>In days of old there was a hermit named Kauśika in
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra. His seven sons, Śvarūpa, Krodhana,
<div n="lb"/>Hiṃsra, Piśuna, Kavi, Vāgduṣṭa and Pitṛvartti were
<div n="lb"/>studying under Garga, a teacher. Their deeds were as
<div n="lb"/>bad as their names indicated. Their father died. The
<div n="lb"/>sons were in want. There was no rain anywhere in the
<div n="lb"/>world. These brothers had taken the milking cow of
<div n="lb"/>their teacher Garga to the forest for grazing. They
<div n="lb"/>decided to kill the cow of their teacher. The youngest
<div n="lb"/>of them said, “If we kill the cow we can use it as
<div n="lb"/>offerings to the manes, and the sin will not be visited
<div n="lb"/>on us.” The elder brothers agreed to it. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛvartti killed the cow and began sacrifice to the
<div n="lb"/>manes. Two of the elder brothers were detailed to give
<div n="lb"/>oblations to the devas, and three of them to offer
<div n="lb"/>oblations to the manes. One was detailed to be the
<div n="lb"/>guest and himself as the sacrificer. Thus remembering
<div n="lb"/>the manes the sacrifice was completed with the neces-
<div n="lb"/>sary rituals. In short, those seven hermits got divine
<div n="lb"/>power and became daring wicked men and ate the cow
<div n="lb"/>of their teacher. They told the teacher that the cow
<div n="lb"/>was eaten by a leopard and gave him the calf.
<div n="NI"/>In course of time they all died and were born again as
<div n="lb"/>wild men in Daśapura. But because of their offerings to
<div n="lb"/>the manes they had retained memory of their previous
<div n="lb"/>births. So they fasted in holy baths and discarded their
<div n="lb"/>lives before the people. They were born again as deer
<div n="lb"/>in the mount of Kālañjara. Because of the power of
<div n="lb"/>knowledge and the penance and fast they discarded
<div n="lb"/>the body of deer in Prapatana and got rebirth as
<div n="lb"/>Cakravāka (ruddy goose) in the lake called Mānasa-
<div n="lb"/>saras. In this birth their names were Sumanas, Kusuma,
<div n="lb"/>Vasu, Citradarśi, Sudarśi, Jñāta and Jñānapāraga,
<div n="lb"/>names suitable to their character. Those seven loving
<div n="lb"/>brothers were saints by virtue of their harmony with
<div n="lb"/>the Supreme spirit. But owing to mental disturbance
<div n="lb"/>three of them lost their attainments. Seeing the plea-
<div n="lb"/>sures that King Aṇuha of Pāñcāla was enjoying by
<div n="lb"/>his wealth, vehicles, big army and beautiful women
<div n="lb"/>one of the Cakravākas, Pitṛvartti, the devoted Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, who being loyal to his father had performed
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice and given offerings to the manes, desired to
<div n="lb"/>become a king. The other two brothers seeing the
<div n="lb"/>wealth, glory and power of the two ministers, wished
<div n="lb"/>to become ministers. Thus Pitṛvartti was born as the
<div n="lb"/>son of Aṇuha with the name Brahmadatta and the
<div n="lb"/>other two were born as Puṇḍarīka and Subālaka, sons of
<div n="lb"/>the two ministers. Brahmadatta was anointed as King of
[Page157-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla in the great city of Kāṃpilya. The King
<div n="lb"/>loved his father. He was mighty and powerful. He was
<div n="lb"/>regular in performing sacrifices and giving offerings to
<div n="lb"/>the manes. He had the attainment of harmony with
<div n="lb"/>the supreme spirit. He understood the thought and
<div n="lb"/>speech of birds and animals. He married Sannati, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Sudeva (Devala); she was in her former
<div n="lb"/>birth the cow of Garga.
<div n="NI"/>Once as the King was walking in the garden with his
<div n="lb"/>wife, he saw two ants. The minute creatures, who
<div n="lb"/>were husband and wife were engaged in a petty quar-
<div n="lb"/>rel. The male one, with loving words, pacified the
<div n="lb"/>female one, who instantly came close to her husband
<div n="lb"/>and they became happy. The King felt amazed at this
<div n="lb"/>conversation of the ants, and he laughed. Because of
<div n="lb"/>the attainments of his previous lives, he had the power
<div n="lb"/>to understand the language of animals, birds, etc.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the King laughing without any reason the queen
<div n="lb"/>Sannati asked him why he laughed. She said that
<div n="lb"/>there was no reason whatsoever for the king to laugh
<div n="lb"/>just then. The King replied, “Oh, beautiful one! just
<div n="lb"/>now there was a quarrel between a female and a male
<div n="lb"/>ant. I heard it, That is why I laughed. There is no
<div n="lb"/>other reason.” The queen did not believe the King.
<div n="lb"/>She thought that the King had been scoffing her. She
<div n="lb"/>asked him how he came to understand the language
<div n="lb"/>of such creatures. The King could not answer her
<div n="lb"/>question. He fasted for seven days. On the seventh
<div n="lb"/>day Brahmā appeared before him and told him, “The
<div n="lb"/>King will know everything from the words of a
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmin, whom he would meet when he goes to walk
<div n="lb"/>in the streets.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmadatta returned to the palace and spent the
<div n="lb"/>night there. Next morning he started with his wife and
<div n="lb"/>ministers, for a walk. When they left the palace they
<div n="lb"/>saw an old Brahmin coming towards them. Seeing the
<div n="lb"/>king the Brāhmin recited a verse:
<Poem>“Brāhmaṇas in Kurukṣetra
<div n="lb"/>which seven as wild men in Daśapura?
<div n="lb"/>Stags in Kālañjara, ruddy geese in Mānasa,
<div n="lb"/>Then, are we, now living here”.</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>When the King heard this verse the memory of his
<div n="lb"/>former births revived and he fell down in a swoon.
<div n="NI"/>There is a reason why the old Brāhmin recited the
<div n="lb"/>verse. The Ruddy geese mentioned before took their
<div n="lb"/>next birth as sons of a poor Brāhmin in the same city.
<div n="lb"/>They had the memory of their previous births. They
<div n="lb"/>were called Dhṛtimān, Sarvadarśi, Vidyācandra and
<div n="lb"/>Tapodhika, names suitable to their character. The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin boys decided to go for penance to attain su-
<div n="lb"/>preme bliss. Then the poor father asked them, “My dear
<div n="lb"/>sons, what is this? You are going away leaving your
<div n="lb"/>poor and aged father. Is that dutiful? The sons replied,
<div n="lb"/>“We will tell you a way to earn wealth. You recite to
<div n="lb"/>the King, to-morrow morning this verse, which we
<div n="lb"/>will teach you now. You will get plenty of wealth.”
<div n="lb"/>The boys taught their father this verse and then they
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest. Their father, the old Brahmin, came
<div n="lb"/>to the gate of the palace at Kāṃpilya. The King was
<div n="lb"/>Brahmadatta.
<div n="NI"/>There is another story how Brahmadatta became the
<div n="lb"/>King of this place. Long ago Aṇuha, the King of Pāñcāla
<div n="lb"/>did penance before Brahmā, who appeared before the
<div n="lb"/>King and asked him what he desired. The King made
<div n="lb"/>his request that he might have a son who should be a
[Page157-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>mighty hero, a learned man, a great hermit and who
<div n="lb"/>could understand the language of all living creatures.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā granted him boon and thus Brahmadatta was
<div n="lb"/>born to Aṇuha. It was before this Brahmadatta that
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa recited his verse and it was that King
<div n="lb"/>who swooned and fell down.
<div n="NI"/>The two ministers were Subālaka the son of Bābhravya
<div n="lb"/>who was the author of the Kāmaśāstra and Puṇḍarīka
<div n="lb"/>the son of Pāñcāla who propagated the science of
<div n="lb"/>medicine. They also remembered about their former
<div n="lb"/>births and also fell down unconscious. When they
<div n="lb"/>recovered the King Brahmadatta and the minister
<div n="lb"/>Subala and Puṇḍarīka bemoaned the loss of powers
<div n="lb"/>they had attained before by devotion, meditation,
<div n="lb"/>penance and sacrifice. They cried, “Fate has made us
<div n="lb"/>desirous of the objects of our senses and we have lost our
<div n="lb"/>harmony with the Supreme Spirit.” They repeated the
<div n="lb"/>cry again and again and they spoke about the blessings
<div n="lb"/>obtained by offering oblation to their manes. Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>datta gave the old Brāhmaṇa plenty of wealth and
<div n="lb"/>several villages and sent him fully satisfied. Then he
<div n="lb"/>anointed his capable and fully qualified son Viṣvaksena
<div n="lb"/>as King and with his retinue retired to Mānasa-saras
<div n="lb"/>for penance.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%A bird as his wife when he was King.%} When Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>datta was the King of Kāṃpilyapura a bird named
<div n="lb"/>Tapanīyā become his friend. Her head was purple
<div n="lb"/>coloured and body black. By and by this bird became
<div n="lb"/>his wife. A daughter named Sarvasenā was born to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmadatta by his bird-wife. The King had sons by
<div n="lb"/>other wives. Tapanīyā would wash her child and place
<div n="lb"/>her in the cradle early in the morning and then
<div n="lb"/>go to the forest and fly about in the air. She would
<div n="lb"/>return in the evening and tell the King news all over
<div n="lb"/>the world. It went on like this for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>Once, when there was nobody in the room a prince
<div n="lb"/>took Sarvasenā from the cage and choked her to death.
<div n="lb"/>Tapanīyā returned and seeing the dead body of her
<div n="lb"/>daughter, waited for a long time. Finally she pecked
<div n="lb"/>out the eyes of the prince and flew away into the air.
