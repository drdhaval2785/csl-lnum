KUCELA¦. Sudāman, better known as Kucela was a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin class-mate of Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the Āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>sage Sāndīpani. One day Sāndīpani's wife deputed
<div n="lb"/>Kucela and Kṛṣṇa to collect fire-wood from the forest,
<div n="lb"/>and they had to stay the whole night there as they
<div n="lb"/>could not find out the way back to the āśrama due to
<div n="lb"/>heavy rain, thunder etc. After their education was
<div n="lb"/>over these two thick friends left the āśrama and went
<div n="lb"/>their different ways in life.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa became the lord of Dvārakā, and Kucela a
<div n="lb"/>house-holder with many children, and starvation
<div n="lb"/>gripped the family. One day, at the instance of his
<div n="lb"/>wife, Kucela started for Dvārakā to visit Kṛṣṇa with a
<div n="lb"/>packet of rice flakes as a present to him. Kṛṣṇa receiv-
<div n="lb"/>ed his old classmate most cordially, and ate one hand-
<div n="lb"/>ful of rice flakes from the packet brought by Kucela.
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī prevented him from a second helping of the
<div n="lb"/>flakes. After spending some time most happily with his
<div n="lb"/>old friend, Kucela started homewards. Only on his
<div n="lb"/>way back did he think that Kṛṣṇa had not given him
<div n="lb"/>any monetary help. But, by the time he reached home
<div n="lb"/>his old dilapidated house had converted itself into a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful mansion, and his wife and children were in
<div n="lb"/>great happiness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's blessings thus converted
<div n="lb"/>poor Kucela into a very rich person. (Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
