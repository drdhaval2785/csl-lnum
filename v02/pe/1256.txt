BRAHMADATTA II¦. Another King who ruled over
<div n="lb"/>Kāṃpilya. This King was the son of the hermit Cūli
<div n="lb"/>and his wife Somadā, a Gandharva woman whose
<div n="lb"/>mother was Ūrmilā. When he was ruling Kāṃpilya,
<div n="lb"/>Kuśanābha was the King of Kānyakubja. One hund-
<div n="lb"/>red beautiful daughters were born to the King
<div n="lb"/>Kuśanābha. One day while they were playing in the
<div n="lb"/>jungle Vāyubhagavān (wind-god) saw them and grew
<div n="lb"/>lustful. But they did not yield to his request. So he got
<div n="lb"/>angry and cursed them and they became hump-backed.
<div n="lb"/>The King was very sorry. He presented his hundred
<div n="lb"/>hunch-backed daughters to King Brahmadatta, who,
<div n="lb"/>by his divine power straightened their backs. When
<div n="lb"/>they regained their former form they became the wives
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmadatta. This story occurs in Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sargas 32 & 33.
