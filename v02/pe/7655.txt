UDAPĀNA¦ TĪRTHA. A holy bath on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river Sarasvatī. It is said that Balabhadra Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>while going on a pilgrimage, had visited this holy bath.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story showing how this place became a
<div n="lb"/>holy bath. Long ago there was a hermit named Gautama,
<div n="lb"/>who had three sons called Ekata, Dvita and Trita.
<div n="lb"/>The father was much pleased at the dutiful and devo-
<div n="lb"/>tional character of his sons. One day he performed a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice and went to heaven. Then the kings and the
<div n="lb"/>priests who were present for the sacrifice began to
<div n="lb"/>honour and respect Trita. Ekata and Dvita did not
<div n="lb"/>like this. The three brothers performed sacrifices and
<div n="lb"/>acquired a large number of cows. With these cows
<div n="lb"/>they started for the east. Trita walked before. Ekata
<div n="lb"/>and Dvita who were behind, made a consultation and
<div n="lb"/>drove the cows another way. Trita walked on in front,
<div n="lb"/>alone. On the bank of the Sarasvatī he saw a wolf and
<div n="lb"/>getting terrified, he fell into a well in which there was
<div n="lb"/>no water. Standing in the well, he imagined a creeper
[Page801-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>that was hanging to the well as ‘Soma’ (a herb used as
<div n="lb"/>oblation in sacrifice) and performed sacrifice, chanting
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas. His chanting was heard in heaven and
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati and other gods came to him and asked him
<div n="lb"/>what boon he desired. Trita told them that he only
<div n="lb"/>wanted to be saved from the well. Immediately the
<div n="lb"/>river Sarasvatī flowed into the well and the waves began
<div n="lb"/>to swell. Standing on the waves he praised and glori-
<div n="lb"/>fied the gods. Then he returned home and cursed
<div n="lb"/>Ekata and Dvita and transmuted them into wolves.
<div n="lb"/>Trita said that their children would become monkeys
<div n="lb"/>and cattle. It happened so. The place where the Gods
<div n="lb"/>appeared before Trita, became famous and got the name
<div n="lb"/>Udapānatīrtha. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 36).
