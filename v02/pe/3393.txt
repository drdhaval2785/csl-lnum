KĀŚYAPA I¦. (KAṆVA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Two sages Kaśyapa and Kāśyapa are mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the Purāṇas, and due to the close similarity in
<div n="lb"/>the names in some Purāṇas the two names are used one
<div n="lb"/>for the other. There is, therefore, considerable difficulty
<div n="lb"/>in distinguishing the one from the other and unerringly
<div n="lb"/>hitting upon the right person in certain contexts.
<div n="P"/>There is a very ancient sage the first cause or the
<div n="lb"/>original father of all living beings in the universe. He
<div n="lb"/>is described, in most of the Purāṇas, as the grandson of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and the son of Marīci. He was the husband of
<div n="lb"/>the original or first mothers of living beings, called Diti
<div n="lb"/>and Aditi. The interpretation that he was called Kaśya-
<div n="lb"/>pa as he used to drink Kaśyam (liquor) is not founded
<div n="lb"/>on facts. No Purāṇa refers to him as a drunkard.
<div n="P"/>The sage called Kāśyapa was the foster father of
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā. The statement that he was called Kāśyapa
<div n="lb"/>as he was born in the dynasty of Kaśyapa is also not
<div n="lb"/>correct. Kaṇva was not born in the dynasty of Kaśyapa.
<div n="lb"/>The genealogy of Kāśyapa is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti—Puru—Janamejaya—Prācinvān—Pravīra—
<div n="lb"/>Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvidha—Saṃyāti
<div n="lb"/>-Rahovādī—Raudrāśva—Matināra—Prītiratha—
<div n="lb"/>Medhātithi—Kaṇva (Kāśyapa).
<div n="NI"/>Medhātithi was Kaṇva's father. (Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 208, Verse 27). According to the Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa a son called Kaṇva was born (Kāśyapa)
<div n="lb"/>to Medhātithi, son of King Prītiratha of the Puru
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. But, nothing about the family matters of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva is mentioned therein. In the Mahābhārata itself
<div n="lb"/>the name Kāśyapa is often used instead of Kaṇva.
[Page398-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>From the above facts it may be understood that Kaṇva
<div n="lb"/>was born as a prince, and that later on, he became a
<div n="lb"/>sage. Moreover, the Agni Purāṇa says that Santurodha,
<div n="lb"/>the brother of Kaṇva's father, was the father of Duṣyan-
<div n="lb"/>ta. According to that Kāśyapa and Duṣyanta were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of brothers, Kāśyapa being that of the elder one.
<div n="lb"/>For the time being the above are the only reasonable
<div n="lb"/>inferences, and the truth has to be found out by further
<div n="lb"/>researches. But, one thing is certain according to the
<div n="lb"/>genealogy, that Kāśyapa was born twenty generations
<div n="lb"/>after Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kāśyapa and Takṣaka.%} The story is told in the 2nd
<div n="lb"/>Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata and in the Ādi Parva of
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata that Takṣaka set out to bite King Parīkṣit and
<div n="lb"/>Kāśyapa to cure him of Takṣaka's poison, but that
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka bribed Kāśyapa off his mission to save the
<div n="lb"/>King. But, the story as such is unfounded. It was Kaś-
<div n="lb"/>yapa and not Kāśyapa whom Brahmā had taught the
<div n="lb"/>science of the treatment and cure of poison (see under
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa) and, therefore, it should be Kaśyapa whom
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka bribed.
<div n="NI"/>4). {%Kaśyapa and Śakuntalā.%} See under KA. VA.
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Kāśyapa and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.%} Father of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga was
<div n="lb"/>one Kāśyapa; may be Kaśyapa or Kāśyapa. The great-
<div n="lb"/>er possibility is for Kāśyapa to be the father. (See
<div n="lb"/>under ṚṢYAŚṚṄGA).
<div n="NI"/>6). After a Yajña Viśvakarman made a land-gift to
<div n="lb"/>Kāśyapa once. (See under KAṆVA).
