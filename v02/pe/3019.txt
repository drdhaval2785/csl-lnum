JYEṢṬHĀ I¦. A deity of inauspicious things. In Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, it is observed that Jyeṣṭhā
<div n="lb"/>was a goddess obtained by churning the Sea of Milk.
<div n="lb"/>As soon as she came up from the sea of Milk, the
<div n="lb"/>Trimūrtis (Viṣṇu, Brahmā and Śiva) found her and
<div n="lb"/>sent her away ordering her to sit in inauspicious places.
<div n="lb"/>The Goddess Jyeṣṭhā came out of the Milk-Sea before
<div n="lb"/>the goddess Lakṣmī. So this deity is considered the
<div n="lb"/>elder sister of Lakṣmī. As she is the elder she is also
<div n="lb"/>called Mūdhevī (Mūdevī). The mode of worshipping
<div n="lb"/>this goddess is given in Bodhāyana Sūtra. Tondiraṭipoti-
<div n="lb"/>ālvār, who was a Vaiṣṇava Ālvār, who lived in 7th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. said that it was useless to worship this
<div n="lb"/>Goddess. Ancient images of this Goddess have been
<div n="lb"/>found. But worship of Jyeṣṭhā was completely disconti-
<div n="lb"/>nued after the 10th century.
<div n="NI"/>In Śaiva Purāṇas it is mentioned that this Goddess
<div n="lb"/>is one of the eight portions of Parāśakti. It was believed
<div n="lb"/>that the powers of this Goddess regulated human lives
<div n="lb"/>in various ways.
