ŚAKUNTALĀ¦. Foster-daughter of sage Kaṇva.
<div n="NI"/>1) Birth. Śakuntalā was a daughter born to Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra of the Apsarā woman called Menakā. Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>was engaged in intense tapas on the banks of river
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī in the Himālayas. Indra deputed Menakā to
<div n="lb"/>break the maharṣi's tapas. She enticed him away from
[Page671-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>his tapas and got pregnant by him. But she forsook
<div n="lb"/>the child on the banks of Mālinī and returned to
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>2) Childhood. Birds gathered round the forsaken
<div n="lb"/>orphan-child. While Śakuntas i.e. birds were petting the
<div n="lb"/>child Kaṇva came that way, saw the child and took it
<div n="lb"/>with him to the āśrama. As śakuntas had petted it, the
<div n="lb"/>child was named Śakuntalā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%As queen.%} King Duṣyanta of the lunar dynasty
<div n="lb"/>married Śakuntalā and to the couple was born the
<div n="lb"/>famous Bharata. This is the original story about
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā's married life. All the Indian languages
<div n="lb"/>contain two different versions of Śakuntalā's life. One
<div n="lb"/>version is that related in Vyāsa's Bhārata and the second
<div n="lb"/>is that contained in Kālidāsa's Śākuntala. Many scho-
<div n="lb"/>lars opine that in the matter of the Śakuntalā episode
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa has gone a step further and for the better, and
<div n="lb"/>therefore both the versions of the story are to be care-
<div n="lb"/>fully studied by us.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Vyāsa's Śakuntalā.%} Śakuntalā, now grown up as a
<div n="lb"/>maiden, was alone in the āśrama when King Duṣyanta,
<div n="lb"/>out in the forest on a hunting expedition, came there.
<div n="lb"/>In the absence of her foster-father Kaṇva, Śakuntalā
<div n="lb"/>welcomed the King. They fell in love with each other
<div n="lb"/>and the King married Śakuntalā according to the
<div n="lb"/>Gāndharva way of marriage and lived with her for a
<div n="lb"/>few days. Śakuntalā became pregnant. The King
<div n="lb"/>returned to his palace.
<div n="NI"/>Kaṇva returned to the āśrama and he was pleased that
<div n="lb"/>what had been destined to take place had happened.
<div n="lb"/>In due course of time Śakuntalā delivered a boy, who
<div n="lb"/>was named Sarvadamana. When the child was grown
<div n="lb"/>up, Kaṇva sent his mother along with him to Duṣ-
<div n="lb"/>yanta's palace. The King did not recognise them, but
<div n="lb"/>a celestial voice convinced him that the child was his
<div n="lb"/>own son. The King heartily welcomed his wife and
<div n="lb"/>son and Śakuntalā lived in the palace as his honoured
<div n="lb"/>wife.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Kālidāsa's Śakuntalā.%} Kaṇva brought up Śakuntalā
<div n="lb"/>born to Viśvāmitra of Menakā in his āśrama and she
<div n="lb"/>had two companions called Anasūyā and Priyaṃvadā.
<div n="lb"/>All the three grew up and became maidens.
<div n="NI"/>King Duṣyanta, who went out hunting in the forest
<div n="lb"/>followed a deer to Kaṇva's āśrama where he saw
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā watering the garden with her companions.
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva was then away at Cakratīrtha. Duṣyanta, who
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with Śakuntalā, married her according to
<div n="lb"/>the Gāndharva rules and lived with her at the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>for a few days. Meanwhile Śakuntalā became preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant, and emissaries from the palace came and the
<div n="lb"/>King returned with them. He left the āśrama after
<div n="lb"/>promising Śakuntalā that he would soon return to
<div n="lb"/>her. He gave her his signet ring.
<div n="NI"/>Sad over the separation from Duṣyanta and immersed
<div n="lb"/>in thought about him, Śakuntalā was sitting there in the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama when Durvāsas came there. She did not see
<div n="lb"/>the maharṣi nor welcome him respectfully. He got
<div n="lb"/>angry at this and cursed her that she be forgotten by
<div n="lb"/>him about whom she was so intensely thinking. Śakun-
<div n="lb"/>talā did not hear the curse either, but her companions
<div n="lb"/>who heard it begged pardon of the muni on behalf
<div n="lb"/>of Śakuntalā and prayed for absolution from the curse.
<div n="lb"/>Then he said that if Śakuntalā showed the King any
<div n="lb"/>sign about their relationship the King would remember
<div n="lb"/>her. Her companions did not tell Śakuntalā about the
[Page672-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>above incidents. Kaṇva gladly welcomed Śakuntalā's
<div n="lb"/>wedding with Duṣyanta.
<div n="NI"/>Days and months passed by, yet Duṣyanta did not
<div n="lb"/>return and Kaṇva sent Śakuntalā, in whom signs of
<div n="lb"/>pregnancy had become prominent, to the palace of the
<div n="lb"/>King in the company of Gautamī and Śārṅgarava.
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā reminded Śakuntalā to take particular care
<div n="lb"/>of the signet ring. On their way to the palace
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā and others bathed in the Somavāratīrtha, and
<div n="lb"/>nobody noticed Śakuntalā losing from her finger the
<div n="lb"/>ring in the tīrtha. They reached the King's palace.
<div n="lb"/>None noticed them. Duṣyanta did not remember
<div n="lb"/>having even seen her. The signet ring was missing.
<div n="lb"/>After leaving Śakuntalā at the palace her companions
<div n="lb"/>returned to the āśrama. Menakā, whose heart melted
<div n="lb"/>at the pathetic wailings of Śakuntalā led her to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa's āśrama, left her there and returned to
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>The signet ring lost by Śakuntalā was swallowed by a
<div n="lb"/>fish, which was netted by a fisherman, who went about
<div n="lb"/>the streets to sell the ring extracted from inside the
<div n="lb"/>fish. Servants of the King took the fisherman captive.
<div n="lb"/>At the sight of the ring thoughts about the past dawn-
<div n="lb"/>ed on the King and he remembered all about Śakuntalā.
<div n="lb"/>His days became sad pondering over separation from
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā.
<div n="NI"/>Śakuntalā delivered a boy at the āśrama of Kaśyapa.
<div n="lb"/>The child was named Sarvadamana and he grew up
<div n="lb"/>as a courageous boy.
<div n="NI"/>On his return from the devāsura war, Duṣyanta entered
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa's āśrama where he saw Sarvadamana counting
<div n="lb"/>the teeth of a lion he had captured. Having heard
<div n="lb"/>details about him from the boy the King went inside
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama and saw Kaśyapa and Śakuntalā. He
<div n="lb"/>returned with Śakuntalā and the boy to the palace
<div n="lb"/>with Kaśyapa's blessings. It was this boy Sarva-
<div n="lb"/>damana, who afterwards became Bharata, the famous
<div n="lb"/>emperor of India.
