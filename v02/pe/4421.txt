MARUTS¦. In the Purāṇas there are references to 49
<div n="lb"/>gods who are known as “Maruts”. All of them are
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Kaśyapa. The story of how the child in
[Page490-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Diti's womb was cut into 49 pieces which became 49
<div n="lb"/>Maruts. is given in Chapter 71 of Vāmana Purāṇa as
<div n="lb"/>follows:
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa's first wife Aditi became the mother of Devas
<div n="lb"/>and his second wife Diti became the mother of Daityas.
<div n="lb"/>The chief of the Devas was Indra and the chiefs of
<div n="lb"/>Daityas were Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu. At the
<div n="lb"/>request of Indra, Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu were
<div n="lb"/>slain by Mahāviṣṇu. Diti who was grieved at the death
<div n="lb"/>of her sons, approached Kaśyapa and requested him
<div n="lb"/>to give her a son who would be strong enough to kill
<div n="lb"/>Indra. Kaśyapa told her that if she could perform
<div n="lb"/>tapas for 10,000 Divyavarṣas with due observances,
<div n="lb"/>she would get a son who would be able to kill Indra
<div n="lb"/>and conquer the three worlds. He gave her a long list
<div n="lb"/>of conditions to be observed during the tapas, some of
<div n="lb"/>which were as follows:—Do not injure any creature;
<div n="lb"/>do not curse; do not tell lies; do not cut nails or hair;
<div n="lb"/>do not touch any unclean object; do not get angry, do
<div n="lb"/>not speak to wicked people; do not wear soiled clothes;
<div n="lb"/>do not wear garlands used by others; do not eat what
<div n="lb"/>is left over by another; do not eat meat touched by a
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra woman. Putting on clean, white dress, carrying
<div n="lb"/>auspicious substances, everyday before breakfast, cows,
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas, goddess Lakṣmī and Kaśyapa himself
<div n="lb"/>should be worshipped.” This observance is known as
<div n="lb"/>“Puṃsavana.” He said that if she performed the tapas
<div n="lb"/>with this austere observance, a son capable of killing
<div n="lb"/>Indra would be born to her.
<div n="NI"/>Diti started the observance as advised by her husband.
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa left for Udaya mountain. After his departure,
<div n="lb"/>Indra came to the Āśrama and pretending friendship
<div n="lb"/>offered to serve Diti as an attendant. Diti accepted his
<div n="lb"/>offer and allowed him to serve her. One day Diti who
<div n="lb"/>was utterly tired fell asleep and Indra took advantage
<div n="lb"/>of this opportunity and gained entrance into her womb
<div n="lb"/>through her nostrils. He cut the child in Diti's womb
<div n="lb"/>with his weapon Vajra into seven pieces. At that time
<div n="lb"/>the child cried aloud and Indra said to it “Mā ruda”
<div n="lb"/>which means “Do not cry”. He cut each of the seven
<div n="lb"/>pieces again into seven pieces and thus 49 Maruts were
<div n="lb"/>born out of the 49 pieces. Since Indra said “Mā ruda”,
<div n="lb"/>they came to be known as “Maruts”. All these
<div n="lb"/>Maruts subsequently became Indra's servants.
<div n="NI"/>After this, Indra with his weapon came out of Diti's
<div n="lb"/>body. With joined palms he begged Diti's pardon and
<div n="lb"/>explained to her that he destroyed the child in her
<div n="lb"/>womb since he was destined to be his (Indra's) enemy.
