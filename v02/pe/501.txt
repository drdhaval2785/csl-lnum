AŚOKADATTA¦. Once the Vidyādhara (a class of
<div n="lb"/>semi gods) named Aśokavega was going through the sky,
<div n="lb"/>when the hermit maids of Gālavāśrama (the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Gālava) were bathing in the Ganges. He hankered
<div n="lb"/>after them. So the hermits cursed him and changed
<div n="lb"/>him to a man. The name of Aśokavega in his human
<div n="lb"/>birth was Aśokadatta. The story of Aśokadatta in
<div n="lb"/>the “Kathāsaritsāgara” is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there lived a Brahmin named Govindasvāmī,
<div n="lb"/>near the river Kālindī. He had two sons, Aśokadatta
<div n="lb"/>and Vijayadatta. They were good men like their father.
<div n="lb"/>Once there occurred a great famine in the country.
<div n="lb"/>Scarcity prevailed everywhere. Govindasvāmī told his
<div n="lb"/>wife, “I cannot bear to see the difficulties of our peo-
<div n="lb"/>ple. So let us give everything we have for famine relief
<div n="lb"/>and then go to Kāśī and live there.” His good-natured
<div n="lb"/>wife agreed to it and giving everything for the relief
<div n="lb"/>work, Govindasvāmī with his wife and children started
<div n="lb"/>for Kāśī. On the way he met a hermit sage who had
<div n="lb"/>renounced the world. He had his whole body besmear-
<div n="lb"/>ed with ashes. With his tuft of hair and garment made
<div n="lb"/>of the barks of trees, he seemed to be Śiva. Govinda-
<div n="lb"/>svāmī bowed before him, and asked about the future
<div n="lb"/>of his children. The Yogī (hermit) said, “the future of
<div n="lb"/>your two sons is good. But this Vijayadatta will go away
<div n="lb"/>from you. Reunion will become possible by the good-
<div n="lb"/>ness of Aśokadatta.” Govindasvāmī felt glad and sad at
<div n="lb"/>the same time. Leaving the hermit they proceeded to
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī. They neared Kāśī. There was a temple on the
<div n="lb"/>way. They stayed there and conducted worship in the
<div n="lb"/>temple and took shelter for the night under a tree out-
<div n="lb"/>side the temple. Other travellers also were there. Being
<div n="lb"/>tired of walking all went to sleep. Vijayadatta the
<div n="lb"/>second son of Govindasvāmī caught cold. So he woke
<div n="lb"/>up in the night. When he began to shiver, because of
<div n="lb"/>cold, he called his father and said, “Father, it appears
[Page059-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>that I have caught cold and I am shivering. I would
<div n="lb"/>grow better if I could get some fire. So please get some
<div n="lb"/>twigs and make a fire. I don't think, I may complete
<div n="lb"/>this night otherwise”. They saw a fire close by. It was
<div n="lb"/>in a burial-ground. Govindasvāmī took Vijayadatta to
<div n="lb"/>that place where a dead body was burning.
<div n="NI"/>Vijayadatta sat near the fire and warmed himself. In
<div n="lb"/>the meanwhile he was talking to his father. He said,
<div n="lb"/>“Father, what is that round thing seen in the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the fire?” “That is the head of a dead body burn-
<div n="lb"/>ing” said his father who was standing close by. He took
<div n="lb"/>a burning faggot and hit at the head. The head broke
<div n="lb"/>into pieces and some viscous stuff from the head fell
<div n="lb"/>into his mouth. There occurred a sudden change in
<div n="lb"/>Vijayadatta. He became a fearful giant with huge
<div n="lb"/>tusks and hair standing erect on the head. Somehow
<div n="lb"/>or other he got a sword also. That giant took the burn-
<div n="lb"/>ing head from fire and drank up all the viscous liquid
<div n="lb"/>in it. With his tongue which looked like blazing fire he
<div n="lb"/>licked the bones. Then he threw away the skull. Then
<div n="lb"/>he approached his father with open mouth to swallow
<div n="lb"/>him. “You! giant, Don't kill your father, come here!”
<div n="lb"/>a voice shouted to him from the burial-ground. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya became a giant and disappeared. “Oh dear!
<div n="lb"/>my child! my son! Vijayadatta!”, cried his father
<div n="lb"/>and came away from the burial-place, and went to the
<div n="lb"/>shelter of the tree and told his wife, son and others
<div n="lb"/>everything that had happened. Stricken with grief
<div n="lb"/>they all fell on the ground. All those who came to
<div n="lb"/>worship in the temple gathered round them and tried
<div n="lb"/>to console them. Among them was a merchant named
<div n="lb"/>Samudradatta, a native of Kāśī. He consoled Govinda-
<div n="lb"/>svāmī and his family and took them to his house in
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī. He showed hospitality and gave them a separate
<div n="lb"/>place to live in. Noble men are kind to those who are
<div n="lb"/>in distress. The great hermit had said that their son
<div n="lb"/>would come back in due course. Hoping that such a
<div n="lb"/>time would come soon Govindasvāmī and his family
<div n="lb"/>dragged on their time. At the request of that wealthy
<div n="lb"/>merchant they stayed there on. Aśokadatta got his
<div n="lb"/>education there. When he grew up to a youth, he got
<div n="lb"/>physical training. He became such an expert in wrestl-
<div n="lb"/>ing and other modes of fighting that nobody on earth
<div n="lb"/>could overcome him. During a festival there was a
<div n="lb"/>contest in wrestling. A renowned wrestler had come
<div n="lb"/>from the south to take part in the contest. In the con-
<div n="lb"/>test which took place in the presence of Pratāpamukuṭa,
<div n="lb"/>the King of Kāśī, the wrestler challenged every wrest-
<div n="lb"/>ler in the country and had overthrown each one of
<div n="lb"/>them. Having heard from the merchant Samudradatta,
<div n="lb"/>the King sent for Aśokadatta and put him against the
<div n="lb"/>wrestler from the south. A very serious fight began
<div n="lb"/>between the two. They grappled each other with firm
<div n="lb"/>and resolute grips. The audience was struck with won-
<div n="lb"/>der at the variety of the modes of grappling and twist-
<div n="lb"/>ing and turning they exhibited. Applause came from
<div n="lb"/>everywhere. The fight lasted for a very long time.
<div n="lb"/>Finally Aśokadatta threw the other to the ground,
<div n="lb"/>and got much presents from the King. Gradually he
<div n="lb"/>became a favourite of the King, and consequently
<div n="lb"/>became wealthy. One day the King went to a temple
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva, a little away from the capital to observe fast
<div n="lb"/>on the fourteenth night of the Moon and while return-
<div n="lb"/>ing he passed by a burial-ground and heard a voice
<div n="lb"/>saying, “Oh Lord! The judge had ordered me to be
[Page060-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>hanged, for a charge of murder, merely out of personal
<div n="lb"/>grudge and without any proof, and this is the third day
<div n="lb"/>since I was put on this scaffold. My life has not yet
<div n="lb"/>departed from the body. My tongue is dried of thirst.
<div n="lb"/>Have the kindness to give me a little water.”
<div n="NI"/>“Punished without proof! It will appear only so to him
<div n="lb"/>who is punished”. Thinking thus the King asked
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta to give the man some water. “Who will go
<div n="lb"/>to a burial-ground in the night? I myself shall take
<div n="lb"/>water to him”. Saying so Aśokadatta took water and
<div n="lb"/>went to the burial-ground and the King went to the
<div n="lb"/>palace. The world was in darkness. With here and
<div n="lb"/>there a spark of fire and light of fire-flies and lightning
<div n="lb"/>mingled with the shouting of ghosts and the roaring of
<div n="lb"/>the demons and occasional cries of birds and animals
<div n="lb"/>the burial-ground was a dreadful place, where Aśoka-
<div n="lb"/>datta came and asked, “Who asked the King for
<div n="lb"/>water?” He heard a voice saying “Myself” and he
<div n="lb"/>went to the place of the voice and saw a man lying on
<div n="lb"/>a scaffold. An extremely beautiful woman also was lying
<div n="lb"/>under the scaffold crying, and getting ready to jump
<div n="lb"/>into the burning fire since she could not bear the
<div n="lb"/>separation of her husband on the new moon day. She
<div n="lb"/>had plenty of golden ornaments on her body. Aśoka-
<div n="lb"/>datta asked her, “Madam! who are you, why are you
<div n="lb"/>crying here?” She replied, “I, an unfortunate woman,
<div n="lb"/>am the wife of the man on the scaffold. My intention
<div n="lb"/>is to burn myself along with his body. I am waiting for
<div n="lb"/>his life to depart. Because of my sin he is not dying.
<div n="lb"/>This is the third day since he is lying like this. He will
<div n="lb"/>be asking for water now and then. So I have brought
<div n="lb"/>some water. But his face being high I cannot reach it
<div n="lb"/>and I am seeing him burning with thirst, and am
<div n="lb"/>swallowing the grief.” Aśokadatta said, “See! The
<div n="lb"/>King has sent this water for him. Now climb on my
<div n="lb"/>back and you yourself give him this water.”
<div n="NI"/>The woman instantly took the water and got on the
<div n="lb"/>back of Aśokadatta who had stooped down for her to
<div n="lb"/>climb on his back. After a while he felt drops of blood
<div n="lb"/>falling on his back and looking up he saw her cutting
<div n="lb"/>flesh from the body of the man on the scaffold and eat-
<div n="lb"/>ing it. He got wild with anger and catching hold of her
<div n="lb"/>legs he was about to strike her on the ground, when
<div n="lb"/>she shook her legs free and ran away and disappeared.
<div n="lb"/>Because she dragged away her legs with force one
<div n="lb"/>bangle came off from her leg and was left with
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta. Her behaviour aroused in him at first com-
<div n="lb"/>passion, detestation in the middle stage and fear in the
<div n="lb"/>final stage, and when she had disappeared from his
<div n="lb"/>sight he looked at the bangle she had left behind with
<div n="lb"/>astonishment. When he reached home it was dawn.
<div n="lb"/>After his morning ablution he went to the palace. “Did
<div n="lb"/>you give him water yesternight?” asked the King and
<div n="lb"/>he replied “Yes”, and placed the bangle before the King.
<div n="lb"/>“Where did you get this from?” the King asked and in
<div n="lb"/>reply he said everything that had happened in the
<div n="lb"/>night. The King thought that Aśokadatta was an extra-
<div n="lb"/>ordinary man and calling his queen showed her the
<div n="lb"/>ornament and told her everything. She was filled with
<div n="lb"/>joy and wonder. She praised Aśokadatta a good deal.
<div n="lb"/>The King said, “Dear queen! This Aśokadatta is a
<div n="lb"/>young man of greatness, learning, bravery, truth and of
<div n="lb"/>good birth. He is handsome too. If he would become
<div n="lb"/>the husband of our daughter what a good thing it will
[Page060-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>be? I have a desire to give him our daughter Madana-
<div n="lb"/>lekhā”.
<div n="NI"/>The queen also said that the thought was pleasing to
<div n="lb"/>her. “This youth is the most suitable person to be her
<div n="lb"/>husband. Some days ago Madanalekhā had seen him in
<div n="lb"/>Madhu garden and from that day a change is visible in
<div n="lb"/>her. All laughing and playing is gone from her, and she
<div n="lb"/>spends time in loneliness and thinking. I knew this from
<div n="lb"/>her maids. Because of my thought about her I did not
<div n="lb"/>sleep last night and only just closed my eyes in the
<div n="lb"/>dawn. Then it seemed to me that a divine woman
<div n="lb"/>appeared and said to me, “My daughter, Don't give
<div n="lb"/>your daughter Madanalekhā to anybody else. She had
<div n="lb"/>been the wife of Aśokadatta in previous birth”. I woke
<div n="lb"/>up immediately. Believing in the dream I consoled our
<div n="lb"/>daughter. I am glad that now you also think so. Let the
<div n="lb"/>Jasmine creeper entwine round the Mango tree.”
<div n="NI"/>When the King heard these things from his queen, with-
<div n="lb"/>out wasting more time he gave his daughter Madana-
<div n="lb"/>lekhā in marriage to Aśokadatta. They suited each
<div n="lb"/>other so much that not only their relatives, but the
<div n="lb"/>others also were delighted. Brahmā is well experienced
<div n="lb"/>in joining suitable things together. As they were all
<div n="lb"/>getting on well one day the queen said to the King,
<div n="lb"/>“My lord! this Bangle being single doesn't shine well.
<div n="lb"/>We must have another bangle made in the same shape
<div n="lb"/>and design.”
<div n="NI"/>The King immediately had some goldsmiths brought be-
<div n="lb"/>fore him. He showed them the bangle and asked them
<div n="lb"/>to make one of the same pattern. They turned it on all
<div n="lb"/>sides and looked at it and said, “Please your highness!
<div n="lb"/>This is not man-made. It is not possible for us to make
<div n="lb"/>one of this kind. Precious stones like these are not
<div n="lb"/>available in this earth. So the only possible way is to
<div n="lb"/>search for its mate in the place where this was found.
<div n="lb"/>On hearing these words the King and the queen were
<div n="lb"/>crestfallen. Seeing this Aśokadatta said that he would
<div n="lb"/>bring the mate of the bangle. Fearing danger the King
<div n="lb"/>tried to dissuade him. But Aśokadatta was not prepared
<div n="lb"/>to change his decision. He took the bangle and went to
<div n="lb"/>the burial-ground that night. To get the bangle he had
<div n="lb"/>to meet the same woman who had left the bangle. He
<div n="lb"/>began to think of a means to find her out. He procured
<div n="lb"/>a corpse took it on his shoulder and walked about call-
<div n="lb"/>ing out “Do you want flesh?” He heard a voice say
<div n="lb"/>“Bring it here”, and he walked in that direction. He
<div n="lb"/>saw a beautiful woman who appeared to be the mistress,
<div n="lb"/>sitting in the midst of so many servant maids on a tree.
<div n="lb"/>He called out “Take the flesh”. She asked “How much
<div n="lb"/>will it cost?” Aśokadatta said, “There is a bangle with
<div n="lb"/>me. If you, will give me another bangle like this you shall
<div n="lb"/>have the whole body”. Hearing the words of Aśokadatta
<div n="lb"/>the beautiful woman laughed and said, “That is my
<div n="lb"/>bangle. I have its mate with me also. I am the same wo-
<div n="lb"/>man you saw when you came to give water to the man
<div n="lb"/>on the scaffold. Now the situation is changed. So you do
<div n="lb"/>not recognize me. Tonight is the fourteenth lunar night
<div n="lb"/>too. It was good that you thought of coming to night.
<div n="lb"/>Otherwise you would not have seen me. Now see; let
<div n="lb"/>the flesh be there. If you will consent to do what I say I
<div n="lb"/>shall give you the other bangle also.” Aśokadatta promis-
<div n="lb"/>ed to do what she required. Then she began, “There is a
<div n="lb"/>city in the Himālayas known as Trighaṇḍa. There lived a
<div n="lb"/>giant in that city. His name was Lambajihva. I bearing
<div n="lb"/>the name vidyucchikhā, am his wife. Only one daughter
[Page061-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was born to me. Then my husband was killed in a fight
<div n="lb"/>with his overlord Kapālasphoṭa, who being kind did not
<div n="lb"/>do us any harm; and I live in my house now. My daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter is now a young woman. I was roaming about thinking
<div n="lb"/>of a way to find out a man of might and bravery as hus-
<div n="lb"/>band for my daughter. Then I saw you going this way
<div n="lb"/>with the King. The moment I saw you I knew you to be
<div n="lb"/>the man I was searching for and I decided to give you
<div n="lb"/>my daughter in marriage. What you heard as the words
<div n="lb"/>of the man on the scaffold was a trick played by me. You
<div n="lb"/>brought water to the scaffold and nobody needed water
<div n="lb"/>then. With the knowledge I have in Sorcery and witch-
<div n="lb"/>craft I put you into a little confusion. I gave you that
<div n="lb"/>bangle to bring you again to me and it has served
<div n="lb"/>the purpose today. Let us go to my house. It is my ear-
<div n="lb"/>nest wish that you should be the husband of my daughter.
<div n="lb"/>And I shall satisfy your immediate need also.”
<div n="NI"/>The brave Aśokadatta agreed to the request of the
<div n="lb"/>giantess. She, with her power, took him to their city
<div n="lb"/>through the sky. Aśokadatta saw the golden city and
<div n="lb"/>wondered if it was the sun taking rest after its tedious
<div n="lb"/>journey. There he saw the daughter of the giantess and
<div n="lb"/>thought her to be the incarnation of his adventurous
<div n="lb"/>spirit. She was beautiful in every part of her body. She
<div n="lb"/>was called Vidyutprabhā. He married her and lived with
<div n="lb"/>them for a while. Then he said to his mother-in-law
<div n="lb"/>“Mother! now give me the bangle. I must go to Kāśī.
<div n="lb"/>I have promised the King to get the mate of this bangle.”
<div n="lb"/>Vidyucchikhā gave her son-in-law her bangle and a
<div n="lb"/>golden lotus flower which he accepted with great joy. As
<div n="lb"/>before he came with the giantess to the burial-ground
<div n="lb"/>through the sky. Then she said “I shall be here on every
<div n="lb"/>fourteenth lunar night on the root of this tree in the
<div n="lb"/>burial-ground. If you want to see me come on that day.”
<div n="lb"/>“I shall do so”, so saying Aśokadatta came away and
<div n="lb"/>went to his parents. They were stricken with grief at the
<div n="lb"/>departure and exile of their remaining son. They were
<div n="lb"/>overcome by joy at the return of their son. Not waiting
<div n="lb"/>long he went to the King, his father-in-law, who embrac-
<div n="lb"/>ed him with joy. Aśokadatta gave him the two bangles.
<div n="lb"/>He presented the golden lotus flower also. The King and
<div n="lb"/>the queen were amazed at the daring spirit of Aśokadatta
<div n="lb"/>who told them in detail everything that had happened to
<div n="lb"/>him. The fame of Aśokadatta grew higher and higher.
<div n="lb"/>The King and the queen thought it a blessing that they
<div n="lb"/>got so adventurous a son-in-law. Next day the King got
<div n="lb"/>a casket made of silver and placed the golden lotus at the
<div n="lb"/>mouth of the casket and placed it on the step of his own
<div n="lb"/>temple for everyone to see. The white casket and the
<div n="lb"/>red lotus were very charming to look at and they glistened
<div n="lb"/>as the fame of the King and of Aśokadatta. One day the
<div n="lb"/>King looked at it with pleasure and said “If we could
<div n="lb"/>get one more lotus like this, we could make another casket
<div n="lb"/>and place it on the left side of this”. As soon as he heard it
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta said “If the King orders it shall be brought”.
<div n="lb"/>But the King said “Ho’ you need not go anymore
<div n="lb"/>on errands like this. This is not such an urgent need”.
<div n="lb"/>After a few days the fourteenth lunar night came. Leav-
<div n="lb"/>ing his wife the princess sleeping in the bed he left the
<div n="lb"/>palace and reached the burial-ground. He saw his mother-
<div n="lb"/>in-law the giantess and went with her to the city of the
<div n="lb"/>giant and lived there happily for a while with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Vidyutprabhā. When he was about to return he requested
<div n="lb"/>Vidyucchikhā to give him one more golden lotus. She said
<div n="lb"/>that there was no more lotus with her and that they grew
[Page061-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in the lake of the giant King Kapālasphoṭa. Aśokadatta
<div n="lb"/>requested her to show him that lake. At first Vidyuc-
<div n="lb"/>chikhā dissuaded him from this attempt. But he was
<div n="lb"/>stubborn. So she took him to a place away from the
<div n="lb"/>lake and showed it to him. The lake was full of golden
<div n="lb"/>lotus flowers. It was a pleasing sight. Aśokadatta imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately got down into the lake and began to pluck the
<div n="lb"/>flowers. The guards came and opposed him. He killed
<div n="lb"/>a few of them. The others went to their master and in-
<div n="lb"/>formed about the theft. Kapālasphoṭa with his weapons
<div n="lb"/>came shouting and roaring and saw his elder brother
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta. He was overpowered by joy and wonder.
<div n="lb"/>Throwing away his weapons, with love and devotion
<div n="lb"/>towards his elder brother he bowed before him. “My
<div n="lb"/>brother! I am Vijayadatta your younger brother. By
<div n="lb"/>the will of God I lived as a giant so long. You might
<div n="lb"/>have heard this from father. Because we have met now
<div n="lb"/>by good luck I remembered that I was a Brahmin. My
<div n="lb"/>giantness is gone. On that day something obscured my
<div n="lb"/>mind. That is why I became a giant”. When he heard
<div n="lb"/>the words of his younger brother Aśokadatta embraced
<div n="lb"/>him. Both shed tears of joy. At that time Prajñapti
<div n="lb"/>Kauśika the teacher of the Vidyādharas came to them
<div n="lb"/>and said, “You are Vidyādharas. All this happened due
<div n="lb"/>to a curse. Now you and your people are liberated from
<div n="lb"/>the curse. So learn the duties and functions of your
<div n="lb"/>class and with your people take your proper place in
<div n="lb"/>the society.” Having taught them everything they re-
<div n="lb"/>quired he disappeared. Thus the Vidyādhara brothers,
<div n="lb"/>having plucked golden lotus reached the peak of the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas through the sky. Aśokadatta went to Vidyut-
<div n="lb"/>prabhā who also having been liberated from curse be-
<div n="lb"/>came a Vidyādhara girl. With that beautiful girl the
<div n="lb"/>two brothers continued their journey and reached Kāśī
<div n="lb"/>where they bowed before their parents. That reunion
<div n="lb"/>appeared to be a dream or something nearing madness
<div n="lb"/>to their parents. They could not believe their eyes.
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta and Vijayadatta each saying his name bowed
<div n="lb"/>before them. Their parents lifted them up and embraced
<div n="lb"/>them and kissed them on the head, and cried for joy.
<div n="lb"/>They did not know what to do or what to say. Their
<div n="lb"/>minds were incapable of thinking. Everybody heard
<div n="lb"/>this and was amazed at it. The King was also filled
<div n="lb"/>with joy. He came there and took them to the palace.
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta gave all the lotus flowers to the King, who
<div n="lb"/>was happy and joyful at the achievement of more than
<div n="lb"/>he had hoped for. Everybody appreciated them.
<div n="lb"/>Govindasvāmī, in the presence of the King asked
<div n="lb"/>Vijayadatta to tell his story from the moment he turned
<div n="lb"/>a giant in the burial-place; “We are very curious to
<div n="lb"/>hear it” he said. Vijayadatta began to say “Father,
<div n="lb"/>you have seen how because of my mischief, I had brok-
<div n="lb"/>en that skull and some viscous liquid fell into my
<div n="lb"/>mouth and I changed to a giant. After that the other
<div n="lb"/>giants gave me the name Kapālasphoṭa. They invited
<div n="lb"/>me into their midst. We lived together. After a few
<div n="lb"/>days they took me to the presence of the King of the
<div n="lb"/>giants. As soon as he saw me he was pleased with me
<div n="lb"/>and appointed me as the commander-in-chief of the
<div n="lb"/>army. He who was overconfident in his power went to
<div n="lb"/>war with the Gandharvas and was killed in the fight.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards all the giants came under my
<div n="lb"/>control. Then I met with my brother who came to
<div n="lb"/>pluck the golden lotus flowers from my lake. With this
<div n="lb"/>all the previous conditions of my life had vanished.
[Page062-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>My brother will say the rest of the story. When Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>datta had finished saying Aśokadatta continued the
<div n="lb"/>story.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago when we were Vidyādharas both of us were
<div n="lb"/>going through the sky and we saw the hermit maids
<div n="lb"/>of the hermitage of Gālava, bathing in the Ganges. We
<div n="lb"/>wished to get those girls. The hermits who saw this
<div n="lb"/>with their divine eyes cursed that we would take birth
<div n="lb"/>as men and in that birth we would be separated in a
<div n="lb"/>wonderful way and both of us would unite again in a
<div n="lb"/>place where man could not reach and we would
<div n="lb"/>be liberated from the curse and learn everything from
<div n="lb"/>the teacher, and would become the old Vidyādharas
<div n="lb"/>with our people. And according to this curse we took
<div n="lb"/>birth as men and separation was effected. You all have
<div n="lb"/>heard it. Today I went to the lake of the King of the
<div n="lb"/>giants, with the help of my mother-in-law the giantess
<div n="lb"/>for plucking the golden lotus flowers and recovered my
<div n="lb"/>brother, this Vijayadatta. There we learned everything
<div n="lb"/>from our teacher Prajñapti Kauśika and became
<div n="lb"/>Vidyādharas and have arrived here as fast as we could.”
<div n="lb"/>Thus he informed them everything that had occurred.
<div n="lb"/>Afterwards by the learning he received from his teacher
<div n="lb"/>he changed his parents and the daughter of the King
<div n="lb"/>into Vidyādharas and then bidding adieu to the King
<div n="lb"/>Aśokadatta, with his two wives, parents and brother
<div n="lb"/>went to the emperor of the Vidyādharas through the
<div n="lb"/>sky. When they reached there Aśokadatta and Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>datta changed their names into Aśokavega and Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>vega. According to the orders of the emperor those
<div n="lb"/>Vidyādhara youths went to the mountain of Govinda-
