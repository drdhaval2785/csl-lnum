NAMBŪTIRIS¦. (Malayāla Brahmins). Logan says that
<div n="lb"/>the Nambūtiris were the batch of Aryans that settled
<div n="lb"/>down in Kerala after the Nairs. The historians like
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkuṇṇi Menon and others have stated that the Nambū-
<div n="lb"/>tiris had come to Kerala from the banks of the rivers
<div n="lb"/>Godāvarī, Narmadā and Kāverī. Famous historians have
<div n="lb"/>inferred that the progress of the Aryans to the south
<div n="lb"/>took place between 1000 and 325 B.C. But Thomas
<div n="lb"/>Fawlks thinks that there were Nambūtiri priests and
<div n="lb"/>hermits in South India, during the time of Buddha.
<div n="lb"/>N.K. Datta, the author of the book “Aryanisation of
<div n="lb"/>India”, is of opinion that during the time of the inva-
<div n="lb"/>sion of Alexander, the Aryans had spread all over
<div n="lb"/>India and Ceylon. Thus historians have not yet come to
<div n="lb"/>an agreement as to the correct period of the exodus of the
<div n="lb"/>Aryans to the south. Anyhow in the Geography of
<div n="lb"/>Ptolemy mention is made that half a degree east to
<div n="lb"/>Taibis there was a place called Brahmagāra. It may
<div n="lb"/>be assumed that Brahmagāra may be Brahmāgāra
<div n="lb"/>(settlement of Brahmins). It has been decided definitely
<div n="lb"/>that the period of Ptolemy was A.D. 2nd century, and
<div n="lb"/>in that case the Brahmins must have settled in the
<div n="lb"/>south before that period.
<div n="NI"/>Though the period of the ‘Saṅgha poets and their works’
<div n="lb"/>has been assessed differently by different scholars, the
<div n="lb"/>majority have fixed it as the first few centuries of A.D.
<div n="lb"/>In these Saṅgha poems the gods of the Aryans are
<div n="lb"/>praised. The gods Sūrya (the Sun), Candra (the moon),
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa (god of water), Baladeva (Śrī Kṛṣṇa's elder
<div n="lb"/>brother) and Viṣṇu (Supreme God) are specially men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in ‘Cilappadikāra’. The Saṅgha work ‘Puranā-
<div n="lb"/>nūru’ is an encomium to the purity of the Vedas and
<div n="lb"/>Agnihotra Brahmins (Brahmins who maintain the holy
<div n="lb"/>fire by burnt offering). In those days the King carried
<div n="lb"/>on the administration of the country with the advice
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmins. Economics, Grammar and law were taught
<div n="lb"/>in royal palaces. Pañcākṣara and such other spells,
<div n="lb"/>reading of the scriptures, Aryan ways of marriage, Recita-
<div n="lb"/>tions of Purāṇic stories etc. were prevalent in those days.
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimekhalā is stated to have reached the capital
<div n="lb"/>of the Cera King and learned Vedas and Sāṅkhya
<div n="lb"/>doctrines (one of the six systems of Indian Philosophy
<div n="lb"/>dealing with evolution) from the prominent teachers
<div n="lb"/>here. The diction of both the works ‘Cilappadikāra’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘Maṇimekhalā’ is, to a certain extent, indebted to Sans-
<div n="lb"/>krit. Many of the Sanskrit poetic traditions are used in
<div n="lb"/>these poems. When these proofs are taken into account,
<div n="lb"/>it is not wrong to presume that in the period from 1st
<div n="lb"/>century to 5th century A.D. Aryan civilization prevailed
<div n="lb"/>in south India. If, during this period, Aryan civilization
[Page522-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>had taken root to such an extent in south India, the
<div n="lb"/>advent of the Aryans to south India must have taken
<div n="lb"/>place at least two or three centuries prior to this period.
<div n="NI"/>The Nambūtiris of Kerala are called Malayāla
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins. Between them and the Brahmins of other
<div n="lb"/>countries there are differences in manners and customs.
<div n="lb"/>They are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) The Brahmins of other parts of India do not per-
<div n="lb"/>form agnihotra rites (maintaining the holy fire by burnt
<div n="lb"/>offering) so elaborately as the Malayāla Brahmins.
<div n="NI"/>2) Among the sixteen purificatory rites, Agnisvīkāra (or
<div n="lb"/>taking up of sacrificial fire) is an important item in
<div n="lb"/>Malabar. From Vedic period Agni (Fire) had become a
<div n="lb"/>prominent God. Most of the verses in Ṛgveda are con-
<div n="lb"/>cerned with fire. The attachment of the Brahmins of
<div n="lb"/>Kerala to fire shows their antiquity.
<div n="NI"/>3) Much importance is attached to the learning of
<div n="lb"/>scriptures and priest-hood in Kerala. There were 18
<div n="lb"/>Maṭhas and residential institutions in Kerala for giving
<div n="lb"/>religious education.
<div n="NI"/>4) The peculiar type of recitation of the Vedas of
<div n="lb"/>the Malayāla Brahmins and the accompanying gestures
<div n="lb"/>of their hands and the movements of the head at the
<div n="lb"/>time of recitation are considered by them to be ancient.
<div n="lb"/>Even today certain sounds are produced by them in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic way. (For instance Samrāl—Samrāṭ; Vaṣar—
<div n="lb"/>Vasaṭ; Īḍe—Īle etc.).
<div n="NI"/>5) In Malabar there is a customary atonement or ex-
<div n="lb"/>piation called Vrātyastoma for those Brahmin boys who
<div n="lb"/>had not undergone investiture with the sacred thread
<div n="lb"/>within the stipulated time. This shows the stress laid on
<div n="lb"/>the need of religious education.
<div n="NI"/>6) The custom that all the male members of the family
<div n="lb"/>except the family chief should be engaged in ‘Snātaka-
<div n="lb"/>vṛtti’ (should remain celibates even after education) is
<div n="lb"/>prevalent only in Malabar.
<div n="NI"/>7) Much importance is attached to evening worship
<div n="lb"/>in Kerala. At that time the Vedic gods are not hailed.
<div n="lb"/>But Brahmins of other places do not seem to attach so
<div n="lb"/>much importance to this practice.
<div n="NI"/>8) The Brahmins outside Kerala repeat the mantras
<div n="lb"/>uttered by the priest and perform the functions, at the
<div n="lb"/>time of meditation and worship. But in Kerala for medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation and worship with or without incantations a priest
<div n="lb"/>is not necessary. This indicates the practice in vogue
<div n="lb"/>during Vedic period before the priestly class became
<div n="lb"/>predominant.
<div n="NI"/>9) The Nambūtiris have recognized only three Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>10) The Kerala Brahmins wear only one sacred thread.
<div n="lb"/>The Nambūtiris became predominant in Kerala and
<div n="lb"/>began to have a hand in the various spheres of activities.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the Aryan civilization shook the customary faith
<div n="lb"/>and religion of Kerala from top to bottom and the
<div n="lb"/>Aryan religion hoisted its flag of victory here. Aryan
<div n="lb"/>literature also found its way into Kerala. The authors
<div n="lb"/>and scholars in Kerala began to imitate it. The Nambū-
<div n="lb"/>tiris erected temples in Kerala with the help of local
<div n="lb"/>chieftains. The sounds of alphabets, sentence pattern,
<div n="lb"/>grammar, poetic tradition etc. of Malayālam language
<div n="lb"/>underwent a thorough change. Sanskrit education spread
<div n="lb"/>far and wide. They spread Aryan civilization through
<div n="lb"/>‘Kūttu and Kūṭiyāṭṭam (Narration of mythological
<div n="lb"/>stories with gestures etc. and collective dance) Pāṭhaka
<div n="lb"/>and Saṅghakkali (Musical lectures and dramatic per-
<div n="lb"/>formances), in connection with festivals in the temples.
[Page522-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>They absorbed many of the customs and manners of
<div n="lb"/>Kerala. The Nambūtiris who had adopted priest-hood
<div n="lb"/>as their career had amassed wealth and landed property
<div n="lb"/>in the capacities of priests and authorities of the
<div n="lb"/>temples. Some of them became Kings (e.g. King of
<div n="lb"/>Iḍappally, King of Campakaśśeri etc.). They kept up
<div n="lb"/>the contact with the people of the locality by means of
<div n="lb"/>morganatic marriages and made their positions secure.
<div n="lb"/>Thus these people, though a small minority, were able
<div n="lb"/>to hold sway over the people of Kerala for a long
<div n="lb"/>time.
