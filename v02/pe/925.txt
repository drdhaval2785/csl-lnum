BALI V¦. A famous monkey-king of the country of Ānava.
<div n="lb"/>This King who was the son of Sutapas was a contem-
<div n="lb"/>porary of the great King Sagara.
<div n="NI"/>Bali did penance and Brahmā appeared before him,
<div n="lb"/>and blessed him and said, “You will become a great
<div n="lb"/>sage and will live till the end of the Kalpa (a period
<div n="lb"/>of world age). Your power will be inimitable. Nobody
<div n="lb"/>will overthrow you in battle. You will be loved by
<div n="lb"/>your subjects and they will obey you. You will be well-
<div n="lb"/>versed in the knowledge of law and its observance and
<div n="lb"/>the learned will recognize your knowledge. You will
<div n="lb"/>re-establish caste system in your kingdom.” (Harivaṃśa,
<div n="lb"/>1. 31.35.39).
<div n="NI"/>Sudeṣṇā was the wife of Bali. The couple had no children.
<div n="lb"/>At last they appealed to Dīrghatamas a hermit, from
<div n="lb"/>whom they got five sons called Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu and Suhma (Brahma Purāṇa). In Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>it is mentioned that he had one more son called
<div n="lb"/>Andhra.
<div n="NI"/>Bali left his body at the end of the Kalpa and entered
<div n="lb"/>heaven. Before his death he had divided his kingdom
<div n="lb"/>equally among his sons. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 92).
