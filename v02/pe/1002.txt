BHAGAVAD¦ GĪTĀ.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The Bhagavad Gītā is a poem consisting of
<div n="lb"/>650 verses divided into eighteen chapters. The Gītā
<div n="lb"/>covers chapters 25-45 in the Bhīṣma Parva of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, and it is in the form of a talk or discussion
<div n="lb"/>between Arjuna and Lord Kṛṣṇa. The mighty armies
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas were arrayed on
<div n="lb"/>opposite sides for mortal combat on the field of Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra when Arjuna, overcome by grief at the prospect
<div n="lb"/>of fathers, brothers, preceptors and other Kinsmen
<div n="lb"/>fighting and killing one another expressed to his
<div n="lb"/>charioteer, Śrī Kṛṣṇa his aversion to fighting. But, the
<div n="lb"/>Lord pointed out to the unwilling Arjuna, by unique
<div n="lb"/>and various arguments, his imperative duty, under the
<div n="lb"/>circumstance, to fight and fight in heroic earnestness with
<div n="lb"/>the result that Arjuna shed his disinclination to fight and
<div n="lb"/>entered the fray, which ended in the ultimate victory
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas. And the dialogue between Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa, and especially the great teaching of Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>on the field form the theme of the Gītā. The Gītā
<div n="lb"/>contains three spheres or fields of teaching; the karma
<div n="lb"/>yoga (philosophy of action), jñāna yoga (philosophy of
<div n="lb"/>knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (philosophy of devotion).
<div n="lb"/>The three yogas are treated each in six chapters.
<div n="NI"/>The theme of the Gītā is philosophy, and it is revered
<div n="lb"/>as one of the most sublime philosophical texts of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindu religion. Many a great thinker and philosopher
<div n="lb"/>like Ācārya Śaṅkara, Rāmānujācārya and Madhvā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya have annotated, and written commentaries on
<div n="lb"/>the Gītā. There is a school of thought which believes
<div n="lb"/>that the Gītā was taught to Arjuna by Kṛṣṇa himself
<div n="lb"/>on the battle-field in something like tabloid form and
<div n="lb"/>that Vyāsa elaborated the mighty teaching in its present
<div n="lb"/>form. The poet, Bāṇa, who flourished in the 7th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D., and the great Śaṅkara, who lived in the
<div n="lb"/>8th century believed that the Gītā was sung by Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>himself. But there are some modern thinkers, who
<div n="lb"/>argue that the Gītā was composed some time between
<div n="lb"/>the third and fourth centuries B.C. and it was inter-
<div n="lb"/>polated into the Mahābhārata in the second century
<div n="lb"/>A.D.
<div n="NI"/>The Gītā has translations in all the languages of the
<div n="lb"/>world. The whole world has acclaimed it as a very
[Page113-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>weighty and valuable contribution in the sphere of
<div n="lb"/>philosophy.
