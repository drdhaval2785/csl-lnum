MAṆIBHADRA II¦. A King of the Lunar dynasty. This
<div n="lb"/>King had many children of his wife Kavikā. Of these
<div n="lb"/>seven sons learned magic from Maya. The seven palm
<div n="lb"/>trees which Śri Rāma broke by an arrow while on his
<div n="lb"/>search for Sītā were but the cursed forms of these seven
<div n="lb"/>sons. The Purāṇic story relating to Śrī Rāma giving them
<div n="lb"/>relief from the curse is narrated in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>The seven sons of Maṇibhadra after learning magic
<div n="lb"/>from Maya created a huge cobra and travelled all
<div n="lb"/>over the world on it. One day they reached a
<div n="lb"/>mountain near Ṛṣyamūkācala. They saw the sage
<div n="lb"/>Agastya coming that way and just to tease him they
<div n="lb"/>coiled that cobra and hid it beneath the ground in the
<div n="lb"/>form of a circle and they themselves stood on it as seven
<div n="lb"/>palm trees in a circle and caused obstruction to the sage
<div n="lb"/>in his path. The sage as he came near the trees knew
<div n="lb"/>by his spiritual powers what trick had been played on
<div n="lb"/>him and said cursing, “May you stand like this for ever”.
<div n="lb"/>The princes knew the hideousness of the curse and
<div n="lb"/>pleaded for redress and the sage said, “After centuries
<div n="lb"/>the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Śrī Rāma would come and
<div n="lb"/>give you salvation”.
<div n="NI"/>The princes stood there as trees grown to unusual heights
<div n="lb"/>with round black trunks casting shades all around.
<div n="lb"/>Underneath grew a shrubbage deep and thick and the
<div n="lb"/>seven trees stood there presenting to the onlookers a
<div n="lb"/>sight of wonder.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma and party reached the place of the seven trees.
<div n="lb"/>Suddenly Rāma took his bow and arrows and pressing
<div n="lb"/>his foot on a stone beneath sent an arrow and to the
<div n="lb"/>wonder of all, the seven trees standing in a circle fell
<div n="lb"/>all together and the arrow returned to his quiver.
<div n="NI"/>When Rāma pressed the stone on the ground with his
<div n="lb"/>foot he was pressing on a vital point on the head of the
<div n="lb"/>cobra lying coiled in a circle under the ground bearing
<div n="lb"/>the seven trees. The cobra got a shock and instantly
<div n="lb"/>straightened itself for a second and the trees thus came
<div n="lb"/>in a row straight on the path of the arrow of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>They were all cut at once and before they had time to
<div n="lb"/>fall down the serpent coiled itself again and regained
<div n="lb"/>his original position and so the trees fell down in the
<div n="lb"/>circle in which they stood. All these happened so quickly
<div n="lb"/>that nobody was able to see what happened and so every
<div n="lb"/>body was surprised to see all the seven trees in a circle
<div n="lb"/>falling down by a single arrow. The princes were thus
<div n="lb"/>relieved from the curse.
