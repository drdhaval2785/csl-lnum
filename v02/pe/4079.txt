MADYA¦. Wine. There is a story in the seventh Skandha
<div n="lb"/>of Devī Bhāgavata showing how Madya happened to be
<div n="lb"/>an intoxicant. Once Indra sent out the Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>from Devaloka and banned wine to them. They took
[Page460-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>refuge in Cyavana a great sage. Cyavana conducted a
<div n="lb"/>special Yāga and invited the Aśvinīdevas to partake of
<div n="lb"/>the Yajñāṃśa. Indra objected to this and Cyavana had
<div n="lb"/>to face Indra in a fight. Then Cyavana produced from
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial fire a demon named Mada and he rushed
<div n="lb"/>at Indra to kill him. Indra then bowed down before
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana and craved for pardon. Cyavana withdrew
<div n="lb"/>the demon and tearing him into four pieces put one
<div n="lb"/>each in dice, hunting, wine and women. That was how
<div n="lb"/>all the four became intoxicating.
<div n="NI"/>In ancient India there were certain social conventions
<div n="lb"/>regarding drinking of alcoholic preparations. All those
<div n="lb"/>drinks which were intoxicants were not listed as
<div n="lb"/>‘Alcohol’. Wine, honey, toddy, juice of sugarcane,
<div n="lb"/>juice of Iruppa and Kuṭampuli, and sweet toddy of
<div n="lb"/>palm tree were not considered alcohol. Surā (liquor)
<div n="lb"/>chiefly meant Paiṣṭī (liquor made out of rice paste).
<div n="lb"/>Drinking of Surā was banned to the three castes, Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya. If they drank Surā they
<div n="lb"/>had to perform a penance for a year drinking only water
<div n="lb"/>or eat long pepper for a year. To be free from the sin of
<div n="lb"/>drinking Surā one should wear dress made of animal
<div n="lb"/>hair. Even if one drinks water in a pot in which Surā
<div n="lb"/>was taken, one should observe Vrata for seven days.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 173, Agni Purāṇa).
