SAṂJÑĀ¦. Wife of Sun (Sūrya).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Saṃjñā was the daughter of Viśvakarman
<div n="lb"/>according to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa (Part 3, Chapter 2) and
<div n="lb"/>of Tvaṣṭā according to Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 66, Verse 35). Most of the Purāṇas refer to
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā as the daughter of Viśvakarman.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Separation from husband.%} Saṃjñā lacked the power to
<div n="lb"/>put up with the heat of Sūrya. She once went into the
<div n="lb"/>forest to perform Tapas after deputing her companion,
<div n="lb"/>Chāyā, to serve her husband. Saṃjñā left her three
<div n="lb"/>sons Manu, Yama, and Yamī also in the charge of
<div n="lb"/>Chāyā, who in the guise of Saṃjñā served Sūrya. He
<div n="lb"/>took her to be his wife and begot three children, Śanaiś-
<div n="lb"/>cara, (another) Manu and Tapatī of her. Chāyā once
<div n="lb"/>got angry and cursed Yama, son of Saṃjñā. Then it
<div n="lb"/>was that Sūrya realised that she was not his wife.
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya felt very sad at this separation from his wife and
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest in search of her. He knew, by the
<div n="lb"/>power of his meditation, that Saṃjñā was doing tapas
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of a mare. Then he assumed the form of a
<div n="lb"/>horse and begot of the mare the Aśvinīkumāras and
<div n="lb"/>Revanta. The Aśvinīkumāras named Nāsatya and Dasra,
<div n="lb"/>were born through the mare's (Saṃjñā) nose. (Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 17).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Reunion.%} Sūrya brought Saṃjñā back with him. She
<div n="lb"/>complained to her father Viśvakarman, that life with
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya was impossible on account of his excessive heat,
<div n="lb"/>and so Viśvakarman ground Sūrya on his drilling
<div n="lb"/>machine and reduced his heat. But, only (1/8) of the heat
<div n="lb"/>(effulgence) could be so reduced, and it was with that
<div n="lb"/>fraction of effulgence that Viṣṇu's disc (cakra), Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>triśūla (trident), Kubera's puṣpakavimāna and Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya's weapon called Śakti were made. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>Part 3, Chapter 2; Harivaṃśa, Chapter 41 and Bhaviṣya
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa For details see under Tapatī.
