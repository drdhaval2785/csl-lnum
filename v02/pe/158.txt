AKŪPĀRA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} There is a lake in the Himā-
<div n="lb"/>layas called Indradyumna. Akūpāra is a tortoise living
<div n="lb"/>in it. There is also a statement that this is the Ādi-
<div n="lb"/>Kūrma (second of the ten incarnations of God). A
<div n="lb"/>description of Akūpāra is found in Chapter 199 of Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva in Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Cirañjīvī (One who has no death).%} When the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas were in exile in the forests sage Mārkaṇḍeya tells
<div n="lb"/>many stories to Dharmaputra to console him in his sad
<div n="lb"/>plight. The Pāṇḍavas asked Mārkaṇḍeya whether he
<div n="lb"/>knew of anybody living before him. Then the sage said,
<div n="lb"/>“In times of old Indradyumna an ascetic King (Rājarṣi)
<div n="lb"/>fell down from heaven when he fell short of his accumu-
<div n="lb"/>lated ‘Puṇya’. Sorrowfully he came to me and asked me
<div n="lb"/>whether I knew him. I replied in the negative adding
<div n="lb"/>that perhaps Prāvīrakarṇa an owl living on the top of
<div n="lb"/>the Himālayas might know him since he was older
<div n="lb"/>than me. At once Indradyumna became a horse and
<div n="lb"/>taking me on its back approached the owl living in the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas. The owl also could not remember Indra-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna but directed him to a stork named Nāḍījaṃgha
<div n="lb"/>who was older than the owl. The Ascetic king took me
<div n="lb"/>then to the Indradyumna lake where the stork lived.
<div n="lb"/>The stork also could not find the identity of Indra-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna. Perhaps he said that a tortoise of name Akū-
<div n="lb"/>pāra living in that same lake might know him. We then
<div n="lb"/>approached the tortoise and enquired whether he knew
<div n="lb"/>Indradyumna. The tortoise sat in meditation for some
<div n="lb"/>time and then weeping profusely and shaking like a leaf
<div n="lb"/>stood bowing respectfully and said, “How can I remain
<div n="lb"/>without knowing him? There are several monuments
<div n="lb"/>of the useful work done by him here. This very lake is of
<div n="lb"/>his making. This came into existence by the march of
<div n="lb"/>the cows he gave away to the people”. The moment
[Page024-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the tortoise finished speaking a chariot appeared from
<div n="lb"/>heaven to take the King away. The King after leaving
<div n="lb"/>me and the owl in their proper places ascended to heaven
<div n="lb"/>in the chariot.
