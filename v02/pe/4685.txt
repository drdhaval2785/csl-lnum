NAIMIṢEYA¦. A sacred place. River Sarasvatī which
<div n="lb"/>flowed westwards changed its course here towards the
<div n="lb"/>east so that it (river) might see the sages of Naimi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣāraṇya. There is a story about it in Mahābhārata as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—
<div n="NI"/>The Yajña conducted by Śaunaka at Naimiṣāraṇya
<div n="lb"/>ended in the twelfth year. The Ṛṣis who came from
<div n="lb"/>various parts of the country were put up in āśramas
<div n="lb"/>built on the banks of river Sarasvatī. But, many Ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>did not get accommodation there and they moved east-
<div n="lb"/>wards. The River Sarasvatī which felt sorry that the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣis could not be accommodated also turned and moved
<div n="lb"/>eastwards, and thus afforded space for āśramas to be
<div n="lb"/>built on her banks. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 37).
