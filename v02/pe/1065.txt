BHARATA III¦. A son of Ṛṣabha.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā-Svāyambhuvamanu-Priyavrata-Agnīdhra-
<div n="lb"/>Nābhi-Ṛṣabha-Bharata.
<div n="NI"/>Emperor Priyavrata partitioned his empire to his eight
<div n="lb"/>children. Agnīdhra got Jambudvīpa. Agnīdhra had
<div n="lb"/>nine sons: Nābhi, Kimpuruṣa, Harivarṣa, Ilāvṛta,
<div n="lb"/>Ramya, Hiraṇvan, Kuru Bhadrāśva and Ketumāla. On
<div n="lb"/>the death of the father Jambudvīpa was divided into
<div n="lb"/>nine states and Nābhi got the land called Hima. Nābhi
<div n="lb"/>married Merudevī and got a son, Ṛṣabha. Ṛṣabha had
<div n="lb"/>a hundred sons and Bharata was the eldest. (Chapter 1,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśam 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage, administration and entry into Āśrama life.%}
<div n="lb"/>Bharata took over the administration of the kingdom
<div n="lb"/>at the death of his father, Ṛṣabha. He married Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>janī daughter of Viśvarūpa. They had five sons, Sumati,
<div n="lb"/>Rāṣtrabhṛt, Sudarśana, Āvaraṇa and Dhūmraketu. The
<div n="lb"/>Pañcama Skandha of Bhāgavata contains a statement
<div n="lb"/>to the effect that India got the name Bhārata from
<div n="lb"/>this king. (It is worthwhile remembering at this
<div n="lb"/>juncture a previous statement that the name Bhārata
<div n="lb"/>was obtained from Bharata, son of Duṣyanta). Bharata
<div n="lb"/>like his forefather was very erudite and affectionate
<div n="lb"/>and always respected his duties. He always meditated
<div n="lb"/>on Brahmā and in his heart there shone the Parama-
<div n="lb"/>puruṣa in the figure of Vāsudeva adorned with Srīvatsa,
<div n="lb"/>Kaustubha, Vanamālā, Śaṃkha, Cakra, Gadā and
<div n="lb"/>Padma. He ruled the country for a crore of years and
<div n="lb"/>after that dividing the country among his sons went to
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama of Pulaha Maharṣi to spend the rest of his
<div n="lb"/>life there. On the rocks lying in the river flowing in
<div n="lb"/>front of the Āśrama were the marks of Cakra on one
<div n="lb"/>side and Nābhi on the other and the river therefore
<div n="lb"/>came to be known as Cakranābhi. Bathing in this river
[Page120-a+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>and doing pūjā Bharata lived there oblivious of the
<div n="lb"/>world outside. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bharata and the deer.%} Bharata led a purely ascetic
<div n="lb"/>life performing everyday the rites laid down by
<div n="lb"/>scriptures and muttering the mystic formula of Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>kṣara. One day a thirsty pregnant deer went to drink
<div n="lb"/>water in a nearby pond. As it was drinking it heard
<div n="lb"/>the loud roar of a lion nearby. Frightened the poor
<div n="lb"/>animal without even waiting to quench its thirst ran
<div n="lb"/>into the forest and on its way delivered a child and the
<div n="lb"/>deer-babe fell into the river. The deer exhausted and
<div n="lb"/>tormented by fear ran into a cave and fell down dead.
<div n="lb"/>Bharata happened to see the new-born deer floating
<div n="lb"/>on the river and took it to his āśrama. From then on-
<div n="lb"/>wards Bharata's mind was diverted from the spiritual
<div n="lb"/>to the mundane effort of taking care of the young deer.
<div n="lb"/>The deer followed him wherever he went and if it did
<div n="lb"/>not turn up in time in the evening after grazing
<div n="lb"/>Bharata went about in search of it weeping. Years went
<div n="lb"/>by and Bharata became old and died with the name of
<div n="lb"/>the deer on his lips. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rebirths of Bharata.%} Because he died with the
<div n="lb"/>thought of the deer in his mind he was reborn as a
<div n="lb"/>deer. The deer was aware of his previous birth and
<div n="lb"/>regretted that he spent the life of a man for the sake
<div n="lb"/>of a deer. The deer, therefore, left the house of his
<div n="lb"/>mother in the mountain of Kālañjara and went to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Pulaha. The pious animal daily bathed in
<div n="lb"/>the river and died there on the bank of that river. So
<div n="lb"/>in its next life the deer was born as the son of a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin in the line of Aṅgiras. That brahmin had two
<div n="lb"/>wives and got nine sons of his first wife and one of the
<div n="lb"/>second. The son born to the second wife was none other
<div n="lb"/>than Bharata. In due course the brahmin died and his
<div n="lb"/>second wife jumped into the funeral pyre and ended her
<div n="lb"/>life. Thrown an orphan Bharata became a puppet in
<div n="lb"/>the hands of his brothers. Bharata was asked to look
<div n="lb"/>after the cattle and fields of his brothers for his living.
<div n="lb"/>With great forbearance Bharata did all he was told.
<div n="NI"/>One day Bharata was keeping watch over the fields of
<div n="lb"/>his brothers. It was midnight. In the neighbourhood
<div n="lb"/>the Caṇḍālas were making merry over the birth of a
<div n="lb"/>child to one of the women. Some of them were bringing a
<div n="lb"/>man bound by ropes to be given as ‘Narabali’ to the
<div n="lb"/>goddess Kālī. (Narabali is the offering of a human
<div n="lb"/>being with his head cut off to propitiate a deity). On
<div n="lb"/>the way the man escaped and the disappointed
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍālas were roaming about in search of a substitute
<div n="lb"/>when they came across Bharata keeping watch over
<div n="lb"/>the fields. Immediately he was bound by ropes and
<div n="lb"/>taken before the idol of Kālī. The effulgence of the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin astounded Kālī and getting angry for bringing
<div n="lb"/>such a pious brahmin for sacrifice she devoured the
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍālas and allowed the brahmin to go free.
<div n="NI"/>Escaping from there Bharata reached a village walking
<div n="lb"/>all the way. That village was being ruled over by a
<div n="lb"/>king called Rahūgaṇa and that king was going to see
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān Kapila Maharṣi along the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣumatī in a palanquin. The palanquin had not enough
[Page120-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>bearers and so the brahmin was asked to join the
<div n="lb"/>team of bearers. As they were moving the palanquin
<div n="lb"/>shook because of the wrong steps kept by Bharata. The
<div n="lb"/>king reprimanded Bharata and Bharata then gave the
<div n="lb"/>king fitting replies based on the ethics of Vedānta. The
<div n="lb"/>erudition of Bharata greatly impressed the king and he
<div n="lb"/>stepped down from the palanquin and bowed to
<div n="lb"/>Bharata.
<div n="NI"/>Bharata went from there to the forests singing devo-
<div n="lb"/>tional songs in praise of Viṣṇu and at last attained
<div n="lb"/>salvation. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
