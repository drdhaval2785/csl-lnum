VASIṢṬHA¦. A hermit who was the son of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The three births of Vasiṣṭha.%} Vasiṣṭha with the radiance
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā, is very famous in the Purāṇas. He had three
<div n="lb"/>births.
<div n="NI"/>i) {%First birth.%}
<div n="NI"/>a) {%Birth.%} Vasiṣṭha is one of the mental sons of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>This is the first birth of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>“Nārada was born from the lap, Dakṣa was born from
<div n="lb"/>the right thumb, Vasiṣṭha from the breath (prāṇa)
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu from the skin, Kratu from the hand of Brahmā.”
<div n="NI"/>In this birth, Arundhatī was the wife of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī was known by the name Ūrjā also. There is
<div n="lb"/>a Purāṇic story behind the marriage of Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī.
<div n="NI"/>In her previous birth the name of Arundhatī was
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā. She was born from the passion of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>As soon as she was born she grew up. Seeing her exqui-
<div n="lb"/>site beauty the Prajāpatis were filled with excitement.
<div n="lb"/>Even Brahmā, her father, was some-what excited at her
<div n="lb"/>sight. Śiva, who understood this, teased Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā was ashamed. Even after Śiva, Brahmā, Pra-
<div n="lb"/>jāpatis and the others had gone their ways, she remained
<div n="lb"/>there blaming her birth. She said to herself: “The mo-
<div n="lb"/>ment I was born, I grew up to be a young woman. My
<div n="lb"/>father and my brothers looked at me with desire. I
<div n="lb"/>also looked at them excitedly. As an atonement for
<div n="lb"/>this sin, I will burn my body in fire. I do not want a
<div n="lb"/>body desired by my father and brothers. With this
<div n="lb"/>decision she went to the mountain Candrabhāga, which
<div n="lb"/>is the source of the river Candrabhāgā, and began to
<div n="lb"/>perform penance. Brahmā who came to know of this,
[Page834-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was filled with pity and sent Vasiṣṭha to her. He went
<div n="lb"/>there in the form of a Brahmin boy and taught her how
<div n="lb"/>to perform penance. After the return of Vasiṣṭha she con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued the severe penance to Viṣṇu. Her penance became
<div n="lb"/>the subject of talk and wonder everywhere. After a short
<div n="lb"/>while Viṣṇu appeared before her sitting on his convey-
<div n="lb"/>ance Garuḍa. She praised Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu was pleased
<div n="lb"/>with her and asked what her desire was. She said:
<div n="lb"/>“Lord, creatures should not be sexually excited at their
<div n="lb"/>birth. They should have sexual desire only when they
<div n="lb"/>are grown up. The three worlds must know that I am
<div n="lb"/>chaste. In all my births I should not look at anybody
<div n="lb"/>except my husband with sexual desire. The man who
<div n="lb"/>looks at me with sexual desire should lose his manliness
<div n="lb"/>and become a hermaphrodite.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu agreed to her request. It was from that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards that sexual desire appeared in creatures in
<div n="lb"/>their grown-up stage only, after they have passed the
<div n="lb"/>stages of infancy and childhood. Mahāviṣṇu told her.
<div n="lb"/>“It is preordained that this body of yours will be burnt
<div n="lb"/>in fire. Medhātithi, (Meghātithi), the son of Priyavrata
<div n="lb"/>is performing the great sacrifice called Jyotiṣṭoma which
<div n="lb"/>is to be completed in twelve years. It is coming to a
<div n="lb"/>close. There is none equal to him because of this sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice. That great hermit's sacrifice is being performed in
<div n="lb"/>the basin of this river Candrabhāgā. Unseen by the
<div n="lb"/>hermits, you should go there and get into the fire. Be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of my blessing you will be born from that fire as
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Medhātithi. You should go into the fire
<div n="lb"/>thinking of him whom you want to be your husband in
<div n="lb"/>this birth.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu touched Sandhyā with the tip of his finger.
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā walked to the sacrificial hall. Seen by none,
<div n="lb"/>she got down into the fire. She was burnt in the blaz-
<div n="lb"/>ing fire. By the order of Viṣṇu; the God fire placed
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā who was burnt in the sacrificial fire, in the
<div n="lb"/>Solar region. The sun divided that body into two and
<div n="lb"/>placed them in his chariot. The upper portion became
<div n="lb"/>the prātassandhyā (dawn) between the day and the
<div n="lb"/>night and the lower portion became the Sāyantana
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā (the evening twilight). At the end of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, from the centre of the sacrificial fire a girl,
<div n="lb"/>like the flame of fire rose up. Medhātithi took that
<div n="lb"/>child in his hands and called her Arundhatī. The child
<div n="lb"/>became famous throughout the three worlds, as the
<div n="lb"/>name stood for the principle that on no reason what-so-
<div n="lb"/>ever will righteousness be obstructed. (Rodha means
<div n="lb"/>obstruction. So Arundhatī is one who cannot be obstruct-
<div n="lb"/>ed). In some other Purāṇas Arundhatī is given as
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Prajāpati Kardama and Devahūti.
<div n="NI"/>b) {%Marriage.%} Arundhatī grew up in the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Medhātithi. Candrabhāgā holy bath which was the
<div n="lb"/>playfield of Arundhatī, is even today, known as Arun-
<div n="lb"/>dhatītīrtha. Arundhatī became five years of age. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>saw her when she was playing on the ground after hav-
<div n="lb"/>ing taken her bath. At the instruction of Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī was entrusted to Sāvitrī and Bahulā for
<div n="lb"/>education. Sāvitrī is the wife of the Sun. Arundhatī
<div n="lb"/>lived in Mānasa lake with Sāvitrī, Gāyatrī, Bahulā,
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī, Drupadā and such other celestial women
<div n="lb"/>and completed her education. One day Arundhatī
<div n="lb"/>happened to see Vasiṣṭha who was shining with radi-
<div n="lb"/>ance. They fell in love with each other. Parents and
<div n="lb"/>relatives and the elders came to know of this. Sāvitri
<div n="lb"/>patting Arundhatī blessed her to become the wife of
[Page835-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. The marriage of Arundhatī with Vasiṣṭha was
<div n="lb"/>conducted in the presence of the Gods.
<div n="NI"/>c) {%Sons.%} Seven sons, named Citraketu, Purocis, Viraca,
<div n="lb"/>Mitra, Ulbaṇa, Vasubhṛdyāna and Dyumān were born
<div n="lb"/>to Vasiṣṭha by Arundhatī. All the seven of them were
<div n="lb"/>Brahmarṣis.
<div n="NI"/>{%d) The meaning of the names Vasiṣṭha and Arundhatī.%} The
<div n="lb"/>meaning of the name Vasiṣṭha is given by Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>himself as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I am known as Vasiṣṭha for two reasons. I am ‘Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>mān’. The Śrutis say that Air, Earth etc. are Vasus.
<div n="lb"/>I have become Vasiṣṭha because I have brought under
<div n="lb"/>control the Vasus beginning with Aṇimā (the power
<div n="lb"/>of reducing the body to an atom). See what Arun-
<div n="lb"/>dhatī herself says, about the meaning of the name
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī.
<div n="NI"/>“I consider mountains, earth and heaven as elements
<div n="lb"/>in which I live, only after considering my hus-
<div n="lb"/>band as the element in which I live. My husband
<div n="lb"/>is the first and foremost element in my life. Moreover
<div n="lb"/>I conform (anurodha) with the mind of my husband.
<div n="lb"/>So know me as Arundhatī.”
<div n="NI"/>{%e) Conjugal fidelity of Arundhatī.%} The Saptarṣis (the seven
<div n="lb"/>hermits) once left Arundhatī alone in a forest and went
<div n="lb"/>to the Mountain Himālayas to gather fruits and roots.
<div n="lb"/>In those days, due to severe summer, the earth
<div n="lb"/>became a wilderness. So the hermits lived in the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas. Arundhatī all alone did penance in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. On one day Śiva took the form of a Brahmin and
<div n="lb"/>going near Arundhatī requested her for alms. She rep-
<div n="lb"/>lied: “There are only Ziziphus fruits here, and nothing
<div n="lb"/>else to eat.” The Brahmin asked her to boil them. She
<div n="lb"/>placed the pot of Ziziphus fruits on the oven and sat
<div n="lb"/>there hearing the good stories told by the Brahmin. Thus
<div n="lb"/>without thinking about her hunger or thirst she sat there
<div n="lb"/>for twelve years hearing the stories narrated by the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin. When the hermits returned from Himālayas,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva assumed his original form and said, “Hermits!
<div n="lb"/>This woman, sitting in the hermitage, has acquired
<div n="lb"/>more penance than you have acquired in the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>Good woman! What boon do you want?” She
<div n="lb"/>requested that that place should be known as the holy
<div n="lb"/>place called ‘Badarapacana (cooking of Ziziphus fruits).
<div n="lb"/>Śiva allowed it. Even today that place is considered
<div n="lb"/>a holy place.
<div n="NI"/>f) {%Death.%} When so many devas were dead at the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice of Dakṣa, Vasiṣṭha also died along with them.
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī followed her husband. After death both of
<div n="lb"/>them entered the firmament and became two stars.
<div n="NI"/>g) {%Seeing Arundhatī.%} In India there is a custom of show-
<div n="lb"/>ing the women, the star Arundhatī. Arundhatī is the
<div n="lb"/>first of the women who took only one husband in her life.
<div n="lb"/>The meaning of this custom is this that this mentality of
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī should be acquired by the married women
<div n="lb"/>of India. Moreover, if the star stands in front of the star
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, it is considered to forebode calamities in the
<div n="lb"/>world. (Kālikā Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Second birth.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%General information.%} Vasiṣṭha who died at the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣa took birth again from the sacrificial fire of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Akṣamālā was the wife of this Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Akṣamālā was the rebirth of Arundhatī. So, in some
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas, both are shown as one. This birth of Vasiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭha was terminated by the curse of emperor Nimi of
[Page835-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the Ikṣvāku dynasty. (For details see under Nimi).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Third birth.%} In the third birth Vasiṣṭha was born
<div n="lb"/>from a pot as the son of Mitrāvaruṇas. In this birth
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha was the brother of Agastya. (For detailed
<div n="lb"/>story see under Agastya, para 2). In this birth the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Vasiṣṭha was an Arundhatī, who was the sister
<div n="lb"/>of Nārada. Thus according to the Purāṇas, it took
<div n="lb"/>three births for Vasiṣṭha to complete his life. It is
<div n="lb"/>difficult to ascertain, in which particular birth, a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular story, stated in the Purāṇas, took place. It is
<div n="lb"/>probable that a large number of episodes might have
<div n="lb"/>taken place in the second and third births.
<div n="NI"/>Stories connected with the life of Vasiṣṭha are given
<div n="lb"/>below:
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra.%} Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>were two hermits who quarrelled with each other through-
<div n="lb"/>out their lives. The quarrel between Vasiṣṭha a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin hermit and Viśvāmitra a royal hermit, is
<div n="lb"/>given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Reason for the enmity.%} Viśvāmitra was a King who
<div n="lb"/>cared much for the welfare of his subjects. Once he
<div n="lb"/>went with his army to hunt. He became tired by the
<div n="lb"/>hunt and reached the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha who
<div n="lb"/>welcomed them with hospitality. He told them that
<div n="lb"/>food would be ready when they returned after a bath.
<div n="lb"/>The King and his men bathed quickly and when they
<div n="lb"/>returned, a grand feast was ready for so many thou-
<div n="lb"/>sands. The King was in great perplexity. After the
<div n="lb"/>meals Viśvāmitra approached the hermit Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>and asked him how he got such a grand feast ready.
<div n="lb"/>He replied that the cow Kāmadhenu in his hermitage was
<div n="lb"/>capable of granting any wish. The king desired to have
<div n="lb"/>the cow. He asked the hermit to exchange the cow for
<div n="lb"/>a crore of ordinary cows. Vasiṣṭha did not agree to
<div n="lb"/>this. Viśvāmitra said that the noble and superior
<div n="lb"/>things of the country belonged to the King. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>did not agree to that also. Finally Viśvāmitra was
<div n="lb"/>about to take away the cow by force. Thus the quarrel
<div n="lb"/>began. Understanding the wish of Vasiṣṭha Kāmadhenu
<div n="lb"/>held her horns and tail up and stood as a fierce
<div n="lb"/>and cruel figure. From the various limbs of the cow so
<div n="lb"/>many thousands of warriors jumped out and a fierce
<div n="lb"/>battle ensued in which the hundred sons and the huge
<div n="lb"/>army of Viśvāmitra met with defeat. At last Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>tried to launch a direct attack against Vasiṣṭha. But
<div n="lb"/>the arrows of Viśvāmitra were changed to flowers when
<div n="lb"/>they touched the body of Vasiṣṭha. At last the King
<div n="lb"/>admitted that the power of the penance of a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>hermit was the real power and he admitted defeat from
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. From that day onwards a deep-rooted,
<div n="lb"/>hatred against Vasiṣṭha arose in the heart of Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>He left the administration of his Kingdom in the hands
<div n="lb"/>of his relatives and went to the south where he erected
<div n="lb"/>a hermitage and began to do severe penance. He acquir-
<div n="lb"/>ed great powers of penance and became a royal hermit
<div n="lb"/>of immense attainments and the quarrel between the
<div n="lb"/>two great hermits Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra began.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 5 sargas from 51).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Second confrontation.%} The next contest between the two
<div n="lb"/>hermits was due to the king Triśaṅku of the Solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. Triśaṅku wanted bodily attainment of heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha tried to discourage the king. Viśvāmitra took
<div n="lb"/>up the matter. He began to perform a sacrifice to lift
<div n="lb"/>up the king bodily to heaven, and Triśaṅku began to
<div n="lb"/>rise up higher and higher. But Indra did not allow him
[Page836-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to enter bodily into the heaven. At last Viśvāmitra, by
<div n="lb"/>the power of his penance created an artificial heaven
<div n="lb"/>midway between the heaven and the earth and placed
<div n="lb"/>Triśaṅku in that heaven. With this the gap between
<div n="lb"/>the two hermits widened. (For more details see under
<div n="lb"/>Triśaṅku).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Third confrontation.%} By the blessing of Varuṇa, a son
<div n="lb"/>named Lohita was born to Hariścandra. He had promis-
<div n="lb"/>ed Varuṇa to sacrifice his son Lohita. But Lohita
<div n="lb"/>came to know of this and he left the palace. Hariścan-
<div n="lb"/>dra was in a difficult situation. Vasiṣṭha advised him
<div n="lb"/>to buy a son and to sacrifice him. Accordingly a Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min boy named Śunaśśepha was bought. Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>decided to sacrifice him. Viśvāmitra said that he could
<div n="lb"/>not be sacrificed. Hariścandra was loved by Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>So Viśvāmitra tried to harm him as far as possible.
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra fell in the trap of Vīśvāmitra and lost his
<div n="lb"/>country, city, wife, everything and had to live in funeral
<div n="lb"/>places. (For detailed story see under Hariścandra.)
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Fourth confrontation.%} Vasiṣṭha did not like the
<div n="lb"/>deception practised by Viśvāmitra, on Hariścandra.
<div n="lb"/>Once Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha met in the forest by
<div n="lb"/>chance. Vasiṣṭha scolded Viśvāmitra, who had only
<div n="lb"/>the guise of a hermit, thus: “You wicked Viśvāmitra!
<div n="lb"/>Why do you put the truthful Hariścandra into so much
<div n="lb"/>misery? You are deceiving him as the stork sits in
<div n="lb"/>meditation and deceives the fish. So you will become
<div n="lb"/>a stork.”
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra looked at the hermit Vasiṣṭha who had
<div n="lb"/>cursed him and said. “So long as I am a stork you
<div n="lb"/>shall be Kingfisher. Thus they cursed each other.
<div n="NI"/>Both of them became birds and went to the shore of
<div n="lb"/>Mānasa lake and each building a nest on the top of
<div n="lb"/>trees began to live there. There was nothing but quar-
<div n="lb"/>rel between the two birds daily. Both pecked and
<div n="lb"/>scratched each other to such an extent that they were
<div n="lb"/>covered with bleeding wounds. They looked like an
<div n="lb"/>Erythrina tree filled with flowers. Everybody who saw
<div n="lb"/>them was filled with sadness. Thus they lived there
<div n="lb"/>for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>Once the Kind-hearted Brahmā, the father of Vasiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>saw their sorry plight. Having pity on them he came
<div n="lb"/>there with the other gods and delivered them both
<div n="lb"/>from the curse. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 6).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Fifth confrontation.%} Viśvāmitra called the river
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī and asked her to bring Vasiṣṭha along with
<div n="lb"/>her current. Sarasvatī did not like the idea. Still,
<div n="lb"/>fearing the curse of Viśvāmitra she agreed to do so. The
<div n="lb"/>river-basin where Vasiṣṭha had been performing penance
<div n="lb"/>was pulled down by the current of the river, and taking
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha in the current carried him down. Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>did not wish to leave Vasiṣṭha at the mercy of Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra. So when they reached the door of the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvāmitra, she carried him further down in a swift
<div n="lb"/>current. Viśvāmitra got angry and cursed Sarasvatī.
<div n="lb"/>“Let blood flow through the river.” With that the
<div n="lb"/>water of Sarasvatī changed to blood-colour. The gods
<div n="lb"/>were perplexed at this. They all gathered on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the river. In the presence of the gods, both the hermits
<div n="lb"/>came to a compromise. Thenceforward that place
<div n="lb"/>became a holy tīrtha under the name Vasiṣṭhāpavāha.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 42).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vasiṣṭha changed Ilā a woman, into a man.
<div n="lb"/>(For details see under Ilā I).
[Page836-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Wives and children. Seven sons Rajas, Gotra,
<div n="lb"/>Ūrdhvabāhu, Savana, Anagha, Sutapas and Śukra,
<div n="lb"/>were born to Vasiṣṭha by his wife Ūrjā. These
<div n="lb"/>seven pure and just persons were the Saptarṣis
<div n="lb"/>(seven hermits) in the first Manvantara. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa I, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>(Rāja, Gātra, Ūrdhvabāhu Savana, Alaghu, Śukra (and
<div n="lb"/>Sutapas are the names given in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>20, of the sons of Vasiṣṭha born by his wife Ūrjā).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Vasiṣṭha and emperor Nimi. (See under Nimi)
<div n="NI"/>(iv) The Ṛgveda of Vasiṣṭha. There are ten Maṇḍalas
<div n="lb"/>in Ṛgveda, of which the seventh Maṇḍala was composed
<div n="lb"/>by the sages of Vasiṣṭha's hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>(v) Cursing Rāvaṇa. Once Rāvaṇa asked Vasiṣṭha to
<div n="lb"/>come as his teacher and teach him the Vedas and the
<div n="lb"/>other scriptures. Vasiṣṭha did not comply with his
<div n="lb"/>request. The angry Rāvaṇa got Vasiṣṭha a captive. But
<div n="lb"/>the King Kuvalayāśva of the Solar dynasty, liberated
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha from captivity. The rescued Vasiṣṭha cursed
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. You and your family will be exterminated by
<div n="lb"/>those born of the Solar dynasty.” (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Vasiṣṭha jumped into the river. See under Adṛ-
<div n="lb"/>śyantī.
<div n="NI"/>(vii) In uniting Tapatī and Saṃvaraṇa Vasiṣṭha played
<div n="lb"/>a very prominent part. (See under Tapatī).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) It was Vasiṣṭha who put a stop to the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>for the extermination of the Rākṣasas (giants) perform-

<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha to dissuade Droṇa from the battle But it was
<div n="lb"/>in vain. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 190, Stanza 33).
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) Vasiṣṭha was one of the hermits who came to
<div n="lb"/>visit Bhīṣma on his bed of arrows. (Śānti Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 47, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(xix) Once rain failed in the world and creatures
<div n="lb"/>became miserable. At that time Vasiṣṭha fed the crea-
<div n="lb"/>tures. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 137).
<div n="NI"/>(xx) Once Indra lost the Devaloka (the world of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas) and he became gloomy and miserable. Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>went to him and consoled him. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
