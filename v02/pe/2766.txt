INDRAPRASTHA¦. Capital city of the Pāṇḍavas. It is
<div n="lb"/>the same as Delhi, the capital of modern India.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Construction.%} As ordained by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra, claimant to half of the kingdom, went to the
<div n="lb"/>forest Khāṇḍavaprastha with his brothers. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>stood by them; great sages like Vyāsa helped them.
<div n="lb"/>There, in the forest, they built a city called Indraprastha
<div n="lb"/>as beautiful as Indraloka. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>211).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Reconstruction.%} Once Agni burned down the Khāṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍava forest. (See under Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna saved
<div n="lb"/>Maya and five others from the fire. Maya asked Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>what he should do in return for saving his life. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>replied that it was not proper to expect any reward for
<div n="lb"/>saving one's life and that, if Maya was very keen about
<div n="lb"/>doing something in return, it might be done for Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Then Kṛṣṇa asked Maya to build for the Pāṇḍavas a
<div n="lb"/>palace, the most beautiful one in the world at Indrapra-
<div n="lb"/>stha. And, accordingly, after getting the Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>duly feasted, Maya marked the ground ten thousand
[Page331-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkus
<F>1) Kiṣku means a cubit. “Kiṣkur haste” (Amara).</F> in extent. Then Maya went to the mountain
<div n="lb"/>Maināka to the west of Mount Kailāsa, where
<div n="lb"/>in the pool called Bindu he had stored a large quantity
<div n="lb"/>of gold and gems. Maya brought those materials as
<div n="lb"/>also a conch called Devadatta from there and built the
<div n="lb"/>most beautiful palace in the world at Indraprastha.
<div n="lb"/>Within the palace were made many a beautiful pool and
<div n="lb"/>various patterns with galleries etc. in glass. It was built
<div n="lb"/>so beautifully and in such a manner as to create, at the
<div n="lb"/>very sight, the illusion that there was water where there
<div n="lb"/>was really no water and vice versa. It took fourteen mon-
<div n="lb"/>ths to complete the construction of that most beautiful
<div n="lb"/>model of architecture. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>1-3).
<div n="NI"/>3) Vajra, son of Aniruddha of the Yādava dynasty
<div n="lb"/>was made master of Indraprastha after the time of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse
<div n="lb"/>11).
