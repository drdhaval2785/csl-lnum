BHADRĀŚVA I¦. A king of Pūruvaṃśa. He was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Rahovādi. Bhadrāśvā had ten sons: Ṛkṣeyu, Kṛṣeyu,
<div n="lb"/>Sannateyu, Ghṛteyu, Citeyu, Sthaṇḍileyu, Dharmeyu,
<div n="lb"/>Sammiteyu, Kṛteyu and Matināra. (Chapter 278, Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Once Agastya went and stayed for seven days in the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Bhadrāśva and his wife Kāntimatī. Every-
<div n="lb"/>day Agastya used to speak in glowing terms about
<div n="lb"/>Kāntimatī and asked about the reason for it he replied:
<div n="lb"/>“In her previous birth Kāntimatī was a servant girl in
<div n="lb"/>a wealthy house. The master of the house once entrust-
<div n="lb"/>ed her with the task of seeing that none of the temple
<div n="lb"/>lights went out on the night of Dvādaśī in the month
<div n="lb"/>of Tulā (Āśvina—October). She did her duty so
<div n="lb"/>willingly and sincerely that she was born as a queen and
<div n="lb"/>you a King”. Then Agastya gave them instructions
<div n="lb"/>about that Vrata which both Bhadrāśva and Kāntimatī
<div n="lb"/>observed sincerely, receiving as a result benediction
<div n="lb"/>from Viṣṇu. (Vāyu Purāṇa).
