AVANTI¦ VAṂŚA. (The Dynasty of Avanti). The
<div n="lb"/>dynasty of Avanti Kings had its origin in the Yadu
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. Candra was born to Atri the son of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Budha was born to Candra, Purūravas to Budha, Āyus
<div n="lb"/>to Purāravas, Nahuṣa to Āyus, Yayāti to Nahuṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Yadu to Yayāti. Yadu had five sons, the eldest of whom
<div n="lb"/>was known by the name Sahasrajit. The rest of them
<div n="lb"/>were known as Nīlāñjika, Raghu, Kroṣṭu and Śatajit.
<div n="NI"/>Sahasrajit had three sons called Śatajit, Haihaya and
<div n="lb"/>Reṇuhaya. Dharmanetra was born to Haihaya, Sahana
<div n="lb"/>to Dharmanetra, Mahimān to Sahana, Bhadrasena to
<div n="lb"/>Mahimān, Durgama to Bhadrasena and Kanaka to
<div n="lb"/>Durgama. From Kanaka were born the four sons Kṛta-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya, Kṛtāgni, Karavīra and Kṛtaujas. Arjuna (Kārtta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna) was born as the son of Kṛtavīrya.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna renowned as Kārttavīrya became the supreme
<div n="lb"/>lord of the earth comprising the Saptadvīpa (Seven
<div n="lb"/>Islands) by the merits of his penance. He got invinci-
<div n="lb"/>bility and thousand hands in battles, as boons. He
<div n="lb"/>performed ten thousand sacrifices all in conformity
<div n="lb"/>with the rules and regulations. To escape from loss of
<div n="lb"/>wealth one had only to remember his name. It was
<div n="lb"/>ordered that Kings other than Kārttavīrya, however
<div n="lb"/>great the extent of their might and prowess, and the
<div n="lb"/>number of sacrifices, offering of alms and penance done
<div n="lb"/>be, would not stand on a par with him.
<div n="NI"/>Kārttavīrya had a hundred sons, of whom the most
<div n="lb"/>famous were Śūrasena, Śūra, Dhṛṣṭa, Kṛṣṇa, and Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja. Jayadhvaja the most renowned of these five
<div n="lb"/>ruled in Avanti as King. Tālajaṅgha who had several
<div n="lb"/>sons, was born from Jayadhvaja.

<div n="lb"/>The family of the Haihayas was split into five. They
<div n="lb"/>were the Bhojas, the Avanti family, the Vītihotra fami-
<div n="lb"/>ly, the Svayaṃjātā family and the Śauṇḍikeya family.
