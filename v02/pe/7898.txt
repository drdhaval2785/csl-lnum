VAIŚĀLĀ¦. A city. This city was founded by King
<div n="lb"/>Viśāla, who belonged to the dynasty of Diṣṭa. Because
<div n="lb"/>Nābhāga, the son of Diṣṭa had married a woman from
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya caste, he also became Vaiśya. The writings of
<div n="lb"/>Vatsa, the son of Bhalandana of this family, are included
<div n="lb"/>in the Ṛgveda. The differentiation of castes was not so
<div n="lb"/>strict in those days as today. It is not known in what
<div n="lb"/>country Diṣṭa and his people Anagas lived. The Kings
<div n="lb"/>Karandhama, his son Avikṣit and his son Marutta
<div n="lb"/>of this dynasty were great and valiant. Marutta had
<div n="lb"/>performed both horse sacrifice (aśvamedha) and impe-
<div n="lb"/>rial consecration (Rājasūya). To Tṛṇabindu, who was
<div n="lb"/>in the tenth generation from Marutta, a son was born
<div n="lb"/>named Viśāla. This Viśāla founded a city and lived
<div n="lb"/>there. That city is called Vaiśālā. Many of the scholars
<div n="lb"/>are of opinion that this city Vaiśālā is the same
<div n="lb"/>as Ujjayinī. It is stated in Mahābhārata that Soma-
<div n="lb"/>datta of the seventh generation from Viśāla had per-
<div n="lb"/>formed ten aśvamedhas (horse-sacrifices).
