AKṢARAPURUṢA¦. When all was set for the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra battle Arjuna showed signs of weakness and hesi-
<div n="lb"/>tated to proceed for a fight. Śrī Kṛṣṇa then through the
<div n="lb"/>famous Gītā enunciated a philosophy of life during the
<div n="lb"/>course of which he speaks about the two puruṣas, Kṣara
<div n="lb"/>and Aksara. All that we see in this world and enjoy are
<div n="lb"/>Kṣara and the power behind all of them is Akṣara.
<div n="lb"/>God is one who transcends the aspects Kṣara and Akṣara
<div n="lb"/>and stands as the root cause of all life. (Ślokas 16 to 19,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 39, Bhīṣma Parva, M.B.)
