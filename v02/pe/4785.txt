NAVAMĪVARATA¦. (Fast on the ninth lunar day). This
<div n="lb"/>is a special fast taken in the month of Tulām (October-
<div n="lb"/>November) with a view to obtain ‘Bhukti’ (enjoyment
<div n="lb"/>or possession) and ‘Mukti’ (Beatitude). The important
<div n="lb"/>rite of this worship is to take fast on the ninth night of
<div n="lb"/>the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Tulām and
<div n="lb"/>worship goddess Gaurī. This navamī is also called
<div n="lb"/>Gaurīnavamī. Another name of this navamī is Piṣṭāka
<div n="lb"/>navamī. This name is given because on that day
<div n="lb"/>Piṣṭam (ground rice) is eaten and the goddess is wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped. In the bright lunar fortnight of the month of
<div n="lb"/>Tulām (Āśvina), on the eighth night when the star is
<div n="lb"/>Mūlam and the Sun is in the zodiac of Kanyā if there
<div n="lb"/>is the touch of Navamī, it is called Aghārdananavamī or
<div n="lb"/>Mahānavamī.
<div n="NI"/>Worship could be conducted on the days mentioned,
<div n="lb"/>by consecrating the goddess Durgā in nine temples
<div n="lb"/>or in one temple only. When the goddess is con-
<div n="lb"/>secrated in nine temples they are meditated upon as
<div n="lb"/>nine separate beings. In such cases Goddess Durgā
<div n="lb"/>should be consecrated with eighteen hands and the rest
<div n="lb"/>of the goddesses with sixteen hands. Of the eighteen
<div n="lb"/>two should be holding Antimony and ḍamaru (a small
<div n="lb"/>drum shaped like an hourglass), and the remaining
<div n="lb"/>sixteen hands should hold weapons that the other
<div n="lb"/>goddesses hold. The nine goddesses to be worshipped
<div n="lb"/>are Rudrā, Caṇḍā, Pracaṇḍā, Caṇḍogrā, Caṇḍanāyikā,
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍavatī and Caṇḍarūpā and in the middle of these
<div n="lb"/>eight beings the great goddess Durgā who is Ugracaṇḍā
<div n="lb"/>and the slayer of Mahiṣāsura. Durgā is addressed with
<div n="lb"/>the spell of ten letters “Om, Durge Durgekṣiṇi Svāhā.”
<div n="lb"/>Adoration, offering to ancestors and exclamation in
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice (Namaskāra, Svadhākāra and Vaṣaṭkāra)
<div n="lb"/>should be denoted by six words and the Aṅgas (organs)
<div n="lb"/>beginning with heart also should be imagined. This root-
<div n="lb"/>spell should be repeated resting the organs such as heart
[Page536-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>etc. on the fingers. He who repeats this secret spell of
<div n="lb"/>goddess, will never be troubled by enemies.
<div n="NI"/>The goddess should be worshipped by meditating upon her
<div n="lb"/>as carrying the weapons such as Kapāla (skull), Kheṭaka
<div n="lb"/>(shield) Ghaṇṭā (bell), Mirror, Tarjanī, bow, dhvaja
<div n="lb"/>(flag), ḍamaru (drum) and pāśa (rope) in the left hands
<div n="lb"/>and Śakti (dart) Mudgara, trident, vajra, sword, spear,
<div n="lb"/>conch, wheel and Śalāka (antimony) in the right hands.
<div n="lb"/>These weapons also should specially be worshipped.
<div n="NI"/>In the worship of the goddess, a cow (sacrificial animal)
<div n="lb"/>should be beheaded with a sword repeating the spell
<div n="lb"/>Kālī Kālī and the blood and flesh of that cow should be
<div n="lb"/>offered as oblation to the goddess Pūtanā uttering the
<div n="lb"/>spell, Kālī Kālī Vajreśvarī, lauhadaṇḍāyai namaḥ.”
<div n="lb"/>Offering to Pūtanā should be made in the south west
<div n="lb"/>corner of the shrine of the Devī. In the same way
<div n="lb"/>offerings of blood and flesh should be made to the
<div n="lb"/>goddesses Pāparākṣasī in the North West corner, Carakī
<div n="lb"/>in the North East corner and Vidārikā in the South
<div n="lb"/>East corner. The same form of offerings should be made
<div n="lb"/>to the god Mahākauśika in the south East corner. The
<div n="lb"/>King should bathe in front of this god Mahākauśika
<div n="lb"/>and making an image of his enemy with rice flour,
<div n="lb"/>should break it. Then give that rice flour as oblation
<div n="lb"/>to the gods Skanda and Viśākha and worship the female
<div n="lb"/>ancestors such as Brāhmī and such others in the night.
<div n="lb"/>As ordained in the Vedas, the Devī should be bathed in
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāmṛta (milk, curds, butter, honey and water) and
<div n="lb"/>then worship before her, uttering the spell “Jayantī-
<div n="lb"/>maṅgala Kālī, Bhadrakālī Kapālinī, Durgā Śivā
<div n="lb"/>Kṣamā Dhātrī Svadhā Svāhā Namostu te”. (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 185).
