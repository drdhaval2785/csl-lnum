DHṚTARĀṢṬRA V¦. One of the famous sons of Vāsuki.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story about this nāga (serpent) in Jaimini,
<div n="lb"/>Āśvamedha Parva, Chapter 39.
<div n="NI"/>After the Bhārata-battle, Yudhiṣṭhira performed horse-
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. Arjuna led the sacrificial horse. He travelled
<div n="lb"/>far and wide and reached Manalūr. At the instruction
<div n="lb"/>of Ulūpī, Babhruvāhana confronted his father.
<div n="lb"/>A terrible fight ensued and Babhruvāhana cut off the
<div n="lb"/>head of Arjuna. Citrāṅgadā sent Babhruvāhana to the
<div n="lb"/>‘Nāgaloka’ (the world of serpents) to bring the jewel
<div n="lb"/>‘Mṛtasañjīvinī’ to restore her husband to life. The
<div n="lb"/>keeper of this jewel, which was under the custody of
<div n="lb"/>serpent Śeṣa was Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the son of Vāsuki.
<div n="NI"/>Knowing that it was not easy to get the jewel, Babh-
<div n="lb"/>ruvāhana fought with Dhṛtarāṣṭra. After a terrible
<div n="lb"/>fight he got the jewel. But Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who did not
<div n="lb"/>want Arjuna to come to life again, stole the head of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, by the help of his sons and threw it into the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Dālbhya.
