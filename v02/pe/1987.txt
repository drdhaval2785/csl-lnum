DHṚṢṬABUDDHI¦. A Vaiśya who attained heaven by
<div n="lb"/>performing the fast of Vaiśākha Vrata. He lived in the
<div n="lb"/>country of Bhadrāvatī, on the bank of the River
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī. The name of the king of the country was
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtimān. Dhanapāla, a Vaiśya of that country had
<div n="lb"/>five sons: Sumanas, Dyutimān, Medhāvī, Sukṛta and
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛṣṭabuddhi. The last of them turned out to be a
<div n="lb"/>wicked man. Going after many women, keeping
<div n="lb"/>company with wicked people, gambling, wandering
<div n="lb"/>about in search of harlots, not venerating Gods, Manes
<div n="lb"/>or Brāhmaṇas, wasting the money of his father, eating
<div n="lb"/>untouchable food, drinking liquor and such other acts,
<div n="lb"/>he indulged in. Once he was seen walking in the
<div n="lb"/>street with his hand on the shoulder of a harlot. So his
<div n="lb"/>father turned him out of the house. He was discarded
<div n="lb"/>by his relatives too. He sold the ornaments he had on
<div n="lb"/>his body. When that was finished the harlots also
<div n="lb"/>evaded him. He became a destitute having no money
<div n="lb"/>or clothes. When he became tired with hunger and
<div n="lb"/>thirst he began stealing in that city. The King's men
<div n="lb"/>caught him. They chained him and scourged him.
<div n="lb"/>Finally, he went to the forest and with a bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrows he lived by hunting.
<div n="NI"/>Dhṛṣṭabuddhi happened to reach the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Kauṇḍinya. It was the month of Vaiśākha. While
<div n="lb"/>Kauṇḍinya was coming from the Ganges, having taken
<div n="lb"/>bath, a drop of water fell on Dhṛṣṭabuddhi from the
<div n="lb"/>wet cloth of the hermit, and consequently his sins were
<div n="lb"/>washed off. He fell before the hermit and requested
<div n="lb"/>him to instruct him in the way of attaining heaven.

<div n="lb"/>The hermit advised him to observe the fast of Vaiśākha-
<div n="lb"/>śuklaikādaśī known as Mohinī. Accordingly he observed
<div n="lb"/>the fast and became sinless. Invested with a divine form
<div n="lb"/>he entered the realm of Viṣṇu. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Chapter 51).
