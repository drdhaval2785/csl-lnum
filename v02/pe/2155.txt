DUNDUBHI I¦. A terrible asura, son of Maya and
<div n="lb"/>brother of Māyāvī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Dānavas were the offsprings of Kaśyapa,
<div n="lb"/>grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Danu, daughter of Dakṣaprajāpati. Maya, chief among
<div n="lb"/>the Dānavas earned great reputation as a unique archi-
<div n="lb"/>tect. Once Maya attended a dance programme in
<div n="lb"/>devaloka where he fell in love with Hemā dancing with
<div n="lb"/>the deva-women. When the dance was over Maya told
<div n="lb"/>Hemā about his love for her. Hemā too had fallen in
<div n="lb"/>love with Maya. And they left the place in secret and
<div n="lb"/>reached the southern slope of the Himālayas where they
<div n="lb"/>built a beautiful city called Hemapura and they lived
<div n="lb"/>there. Ere long they-had two sons, Dundubhi and
<div n="lb"/>Māyāvī, both of them equally distinguished in prowess.
<div n="lb"/>Uttararāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Dundubhi's relationship with Rāvaṇa.%} Maya did tapas
<div n="lb"/>for a daughter in the western plains of Mount Kailāsa.
<div n="lb"/>One of those days Pārvatī went out of Kailāsa to feed
<div n="lb"/>brahmins in celebration of the birthday of Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya. In the absence of Pārvatī a deva woman called
<div n="lb"/>Madhurā who had observed the Somavāravrata came
<div n="lb"/>to Kailāsa to salute Mahādeva (Śiva) who enjoyed her
<div n="lb"/>for some time. On her return to Śiva Pārvatī noticed
<div n="lb"/>ashes worn by him transferred to the breasts of
<div n="lb"/>Madhurā. Drawing the natural inference from this
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī got angry and cursed Madhurā to be transform-
[Page253-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ed into a frog. Then Śiva blessed her that she would
<div n="lb"/>regain her former self after twelve years and have a
<div n="lb"/>heroic husband. Madhurā who was thus turned into a
<div n="lb"/>frog fell into a well close to where Maya was engaged
<div n="lb"/>in tapas. And, after twelve years, the frog regained its
<div n="lb"/>former form and became Madhurā again. Maya, who
<div n="lb"/>saw her adopted her as daughter and brought her up as
<div n="lb"/>such calling her Mandodarī. Mandodarī became Rāv-
<div n="lb"/>aṇa’ wife and thus Dundubhi became the brother-in-law
<div n="lb"/>of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Dundubhi grew up.%} The following is told about Dun-
<div n="lb"/>dubhi in Canto 11, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>As beautiful and majestic as the peak of Mount Kailāsa,
<div n="lb"/>the heroic Dundubhi possessed the form of the buffalo.
<div n="lb"/>And, he had the strength of a thousand elephants.
<div n="lb"/>Proud and haughty over his own prowess and losing his
<div n="lb"/>head over the boon he had received from God, Dundu-
<div n="lb"/>bhi went to fight with the ocean, the lord of rivers. (It
<div n="lb"/>was Śiva who gave him boons. See M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Fight with Bāli and death.%} Haughty almost to mad-
<div n="lb"/>ness over the unrivalled strength and prowess he got as
<div n="lb"/>the result of the boon, Dundubhi went about challeng-
<div n="lb"/>ing whomsoever he met for a fight. But none dared to
<div n="lb"/>accept the challenge. Then he went to the sea-shore
<div n="lb"/>and challenged Varuṇa, who, appearing on the crest
<div n="lb"/>of the waves said: “I am not strong and powerful
<div n="lb"/>enough to fight with you. Only Himavān can do that.
<div n="lb"/>So, please go north.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Dundubhi went north to Himavān and
<div n="lb"/>challenged him in great rage. Himavān clad in his neat
<div n="lb"/>and white apparel appeared and spoke in humble tones:
<div n="lb"/>“Oh mighty Dānava: I am not accustomed to fighting
<div n="lb"/>war. My job is only to arrange necessary conveni-
<div n="lb"/>ence to saints and sages. But, there is in southern India
<div n="lb"/>a very powerful monkey called Bāli, who is the King of
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā, and Bāli alone can combat with you.
<div n="NI"/>And, Dundubhi accordingly went southward to Kiṣkin-
<div n="lb"/>dhā and challenged Bāli. Terrible as the dark clouds in
<div n="lb"/>the sky the dānava who possessed the body and
<div n="lb"/>horns of the buffalo—began roaring like hell at the tower
<div n="lb"/>gates of Kiṣkindhā, uprooting trees with his horn and
<div n="lb"/>tearing the earth with his hoofs. Disturbed by the noise
<div n="lb"/>Bāli along with his wife Tārā came out of the palace,
<div n="lb"/>and said to Dundubhi: “Look here, please, I am only
<div n="lb"/>a King of the monkeys. Why should you, who are so
<div n="lb"/>very strong smash my tower?” but, these soft words of
<div n="lb"/>Bāli only kindled Dundubhi's anger all the more and his
<div n="lb"/>challenges became the fiercer. Then did Bāli, wearing
<div n="lb"/>the golden chain given by Indra, rush forth to engage
<div n="lb"/>Dundubhi in mortal duel in which the former began
<div n="lb"/>gaining more and more strength while the latter got wea-
<div n="lb"/>ker and weaker. Dundubhi took to flight in the skies to
<div n="lb"/>save his life. But, the moon dawned then and in the
<div n="lb"/>moonlight Bāli and his brother Sugrīva followed Dun-
<div n="lb"/>dubhi, who entered a terrible cave covered by something
<div n="lb"/>like a forest of grass. After stationing Sugrīva at the
<div n="lb"/>opening of the cave Bāli followed Dundubhi into the
<div n="lb"/>cave. Sugrīva waited there one year for the return of
<div n="lb"/>Bāli from the cave when one day he witnessed foaming
<div n="lb"/>blood flow out of the mouth of the cave, and mistakenly
<div n="lb"/>believing that Bāli was dead he closed the mouth of the
<div n="lb"/>cave with a huge stone and returned home. But, Bāli,
<div n="lb"/>who had by then killed Dundubhi kicked off the stone
[Page254-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and came out of the cave and followed Sugrīva in a
<div n="lb"/>rage. From that day onwards Śugrīva lived at the Ṛṣya-
<div n="lb"/>mūka mountain where Bāli had no admission. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Cantos 9, 11, 46).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Curse on Bāli due to the blood of Dundubhi.%} During
<div n="lb"/>Bāli's duel with Dundubhi blood from the body of the
<div n="lb"/>latter spurted out to the skies, and it also fell in the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Mataṅga at Ṛṣyamūka where the sage
<div n="lb"/>Mataṅga was performing tapas. Angered at this the sage
<div n="lb"/>cursed him whoever he might be, who was responsible
<div n="lb"/>for blood falling in his āśrama, with death by his head
<div n="lb"/>getting broken if he mounted Ṛṣyamūka. Sugrīva took
<div n="lb"/>shelter there because of this curse on Bāli. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Canto 11)
