<div n="NI"/>The famous Āśvalāyanācārya was Śaunaka's disciple.
<div n="lb"/>Ācāryas like Kātyāyana, Patañjali and Vyāsa belonged
<div n="lb"/>to his class. Śaunaka's real name was “Gṛtsamada”. It

<div n="lb"/>lāyana. Once Āśvalāyana wrote and dedicated to his
<div n="lb"/>Guru (master) two treatises entitled “Gṛhyasūtra” and
<div n="lb"/>“Śrautasūtra” to please him. After reading it, Śaunaka
<div n="lb"/>destroyed his own work on “Śrautaśāstra”. Āśvalāyana
<div n="lb"/>wrote his treatise after having studied the ten works of
<div n="lb"/>Śaunaka on Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>Kātyāyana, the disciple of Āśvalāyana later received
<div n="lb"/>the ten books written by Śaunaka and the three books
<div n="lb"/>written by Āśvalāyana. Kātyāyana gave his disciple
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali, the two works, “Yajurvedakalpasūtra” and
<div n="lb"/>“Sāmaveda Upagrantha” which were written by him-
<div n="lb"/>self. From this we may infer that the series of Śaunaka's
<div n="lb"/>disciples was as follows:—Śaunaka—Āśvalāyana—
<div n="lb"/>Kātyāyana—Patañjali—Vyāsa.
