TRIŚAṄKU I¦. (SATYAVRATA, MATAṄGA). A
<div n="lb"/>celebrated King of the Solar dynasty.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Father discards him.%} When Satyavrata grew up he
<div n="lb"/>became a lewd, lustful imprudent man. One day while he
<div n="lb"/>was leading such a contemptuous life, a marriage was
<div n="lb"/>being conducted in a brahmin house. Guests had
<div n="lb"/>assembled, the bridegroom had come and the ceremony
<div n="lb"/>was about to start when Satyavrata entered the
<div n="lb"/>marriage hall and carried away by force the bride to
<div n="lb"/>the shock of all those present there. Some of the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>guests immediately went to Trayyāruṇa and told him
<div n="lb"/>what a shameful crime his son had committed. The enrag-
<div n="lb"/>ed father at once sent Satyavrata out from the palace.
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata left the country altogether and went and
<div n="lb"/>stayed in a colony of harijans. Though he lived with
<div n="lb"/>those low-caste people he did not adopt their mode of
<div n="lb"/>living. He went out daily to the forests with his bow
<div n="lb"/>and arrow and made his food. He never felt any
<div n="lb"/>animosity towards his father who had thus sent him out
<div n="lb"/>from his country. He thought thus “Of course, my father
<div n="lb"/>got terribly angry when he heard the complaints of the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins and in that mood punished me thus, though
<div n="lb"/>the punishment was a bit too much. But our family
<div n="lb"/>preceptor Vasiṣṭha, who knows everything, who is a
<div n="lb"/>moralist and a righteous man, who has the knowledge
<div n="lb"/>and authority to prescribe atonement for all sins, did
<div n="lb"/>severe punishment. That was very hard.” As he thought
<div n="lb"/>more about it in this vein, he felt a great hatred towards
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Satyavrata and Viśvāmitra's family.%} When his only
<div n="lb"/>son Satyavrata was turned out from the family, King
<div n="lb"/>Trayyāruṇa was greatly distressed. He went to the
[Page794-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>forests to do penance to get another son. At that time
<div n="lb"/>the country did not have rains for twelve successive
<div n="lb"/>years as a punishment for the King for sending out his
<div n="lb"/>son. The people suffered much. Among the people who
<div n="lb"/>were suffering were the wife and children of Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra at that time had gone to the shores of river
<div n="lb"/>Kauśikī for doing penance. Viśvāmitra's family consist-
<div n="lb"/>ing of his wife and three sons during that famine lived
<div n="lb"/>in hunger. At last the mother decided to sell the middle
<div n="lb"/>son and buy food with the money received by the sale.
<div n="lb"/>She put a rope made of darbha grass round the neck
<div n="lb"/>of the boy and took him to the market. On the way
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata saw them and on hearing their sad story told
<div n="lb"/>them not to sell the child. He assured them that he
<div n="lb"/>would take care of them till the return of Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>He removed the darbha rope from the child's neck and
<div n="lb"/>the child got the name of Gālava from that time on-
<div n="lb"/>wards. (Gala=neck). He promised them he would
<div n="lb"/>daily place enough meat at the foot of a tree near the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. True to his promise, he hunted in the forests
<div n="lb"/>and brought to the foot of the tree fresh flesh of deer or
<div n="lb"/>hare or boar and also fresh fruits. The family lived
<div n="lb"/>happily because of him.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Curse of Vasiṣṭha and the name of Triśaṅku.%} When
<div n="lb"/>Trayyāruṇa went to the forests to do penance, it was
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha who was managing the affairs of the palace.
<div n="lb"/>The heir-apparent Satyavrata lived in the hut of a
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍāla. Every minute Satyavrata's hatred towards
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha increased in strength. One day Satyavrata did
<div n="lb"/>not get any game even after a day's hunting and at
<div n="lb"/>dusk he happened to reach the āśrama of Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>where he saw Nandinī, the beloved cow of the sage,
<div n="lb"/>grazing by the side of the āśrama. Anger, desire and
<div n="lb"/>hunger made him imprudent and without thinking of
<div n="lb"/>the consequences Satyavrata killed Nandinī and after
<div n="lb"/>eating enough to appease his hunger took the rest to
<div n="lb"/>feed the family of Viśvāmitra. The wife of Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>little knowing that it was cow's flesh cooked it and
<div n="lb"/>ate it.
<div n="NI"/>That night when Vasiṣṭha came to the āśrama he found
<div n="lb"/>Nandinī missing and he went in search of it. After some
<div n="lb"/>time the sage knew that Satyavrata had killed and eaten
<div n="lb"/>it. The enraged sage called Satyavrata to his side and
<div n="lb"/>cursed him thus “You will from today become a
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍāla. Three śaṅkus (sins) namely wrath of a father,
<div n="lb"/>abduction of another man's wife and consumption of
<div n="lb"/>cow's flesh will give you life-long trouble and thus you
<div n="lb"/>will earn a name, Triśaṅku (Three śaṅkus). Instantly
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata became a caṇḍāla and started roaming
<div n="lb"/>about in the streets.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Triśaṅku becomes King.%} Triśaṅku, distressed at heart
<div n="lb"/>by a father's wrath and a Guru's curse walked about
<div n="lb"/>aimlessly in the forests. He expressed his desire to the
<div n="lb"/>ṛṣis and Brahmins to do a yāga and get himself absolved
<div n="lb"/>of all his sins. But nobody was willing to help a wretch-
<div n="lb"/>ed man cursed and abandoned by both his father and
<div n="lb"/>his Guru. Feeling desperate, he decided to commit
<div n="lb"/>suicide. He made a great fire-pit and prepared himself
<div n="lb"/>to jump into it. Before doing that he prayed to the
<div n="lb"/>goddess and when the goddess knew that his devotee
<div n="lb"/>would jump into the fire and become ashes, she appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed before him in person and said thus: “Son, why do
<div n="lb"/>you try to jump into the fire? Your father has become
<div n="lb"/>old and day after tomorrow he will crown you as King
[Page795-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and then go to the forests to do penance. Look, there
<div n="lb"/>comes your father's minister to take you to the palace.”
<div n="lb"/>When the goddess disappeared Satyavrata returned to
<div n="lb"/>his āśrama in a pensive mood. Nārada went and in-
<div n="lb"/>formed the king of everything that happened in the
<div n="lb"/>forest and the king immediately sent his ministers to
<div n="lb"/>fetch Satyavrata to the palace. When Satyavrata came
<div n="lb"/>the king crowned him as king and then went to the
<div n="lb"/>forests for penance.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Satyavrata becomes Caṇḍāla again.%} Satyavrata ruled the
<div n="lb"/>country for a long time. He was a pious ruler, devoted
<div n="lb"/>to god and soon he developed a desire to go to heaven
<div n="lb"/>with his mortal body. He approached Vasiṣṭha first
<div n="lb"/>for this purpose. But the family preceptor told him
<div n="lb"/>there was nothing in the śāstras about any yāga which
<div n="lb"/>could help one to go bodily to heaven. Disappointed
<div n="lb"/>he approached the sons of Vasiṣṭha who ridiculed him
<div n="lb"/>when he told them of his queer desire. Triśaṅku got
<div n="lb"/>angry and left them saying “Let me see whether there
<div n="lb"/>are others in this country who could send me bodily to
<div n="lb"/>heaven.” Those arrogant words annoyed Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>his sons and they cursed him and made him a caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>again. Triśaṅku thereafter did not return to the palace,
<div n="lb"/>but went to the forests to live there. He knew if he
<div n="lb"/>returned to the palace as a caṇḍāla he would not be
<div n="lb"/>recognised by his wife and children.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra, son of Triśaṅku, heard about the curse on
<div n="lb"/>his father and sent the ministers to fetch his father to
<div n="lb"/>the palace. But Triśaṅku did not come back and so the
<div n="lb"/>ministers made Hariścandra the king of Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Viśvāmitra meets Triśaṅku.%} When Hariścandra became
<div n="lb"/>king, Triśaṅku was living in Ambāvana (forest of Ambā)
<div n="lb"/>as a great devotee of the goddess. It was at that time
<div n="lb"/>that Viśvāmitra returned home after his penance. Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra enquired of his wife how they managed to live
<div n="lb"/>during the great famine. Then Satyavatī, wife of Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra, told him the whole story of how Satyavrata helped
<div n="lb"/>them, why he killed Nandinī, Vasiṣṭha's cow, and how
<div n="lb"/>they ate cow's flesh, how Satyavrata was cursed to be a
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍāla, how he was called back as king and how he was
<div n="lb"/>at that time living in Ambāvana. The eyes of Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitrā became wet when he heard the sorrowful story
<div n="lb"/>and he decided to end the caṇḍālatva (state of being a
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍāla) of Satyavrata. He went straight to Ambāvana
<div n="lb"/>and met Triśaṅku there.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Triśaṅku Svarga (Heaven of Triśaṅku).%} Viśvāmitra pro-
<div n="lb"/>mised Triśaṅku that he would send him to heaven bodily
<div n="lb"/>and made preparations for a yāga. No other sage par-
<div n="lb"/>took in the yāga because of instructions from Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>But undaunted, Viśvāmitra conducted the yāga alone
<div n="lb"/>and, as the power of his performances increased, Tri-
<div n="lb"/>śaṅku started rising bodily from earth slowly and soon
<div n="lb"/>rose up to heaven. When the devas found a Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>standing with his physical body before the gates of
<div n="lb"/>heaven, they ran to Indra and told him. Indra got
<div n="lb"/>angry and pushed him out from heaven and Triśaṅku
<div n="lb"/>came falling down with his head turned downwards to
<div n="lb"/>the earth. Triśaṅku cried loudly calling Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>by name. When Viśvāmitra, hearing the noise, looked
<div n="lb"/>up he saw poor Triśaṅku descending fast from heaven
<div n="lb"/>with his head turned upside down. Viśvāmitra's anger
<div n="lb"/>knew no bounds and he roared aloud “Let Triśaṅku
<div n="lb"/>stay where he is now.” Triśaṅku stopped in mid-air.
<div n="lb"/>Indra did not allow Triśaṅku to come up and Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra did not allow him to come down. Indra then made
[Page795-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>a separate heaven for Triśaṅku below original
<div n="lb"/>heaven. Then Viśvāmitra started to create another Indra
<div n="lb"/>and devas for the new heaven. The devas were frightened
<div n="lb"/>and Indra then approached Viśvāmitra and requested
<div n="lb"/>him to desist from his attempt to make duplicate devas
<div n="lb"/>promising him that he would give Triśaṅku a seat in
<div n="lb"/>his heaven itself. Viśvāmitra agreed to it. At once
<div n="lb"/>Indra brought a golden Vimāna and took him bodily to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. (Sargas 57 to 59, Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
