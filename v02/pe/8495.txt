VIṢṆU¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara
<div n="lb"/>are the Lords of creation, sustenance and extermination
<div n="lb"/>of this perishable universe. These trimūrtis (three
<div n="lb"/>figures) also are perishable. It is said, that one day of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā will constitute thousand four-fold (catur) yugas
<div n="lb"/>and that during the life of Brahmā, fourteen Indras will
<div n="lb"/>fall down from heaven and die. This is a Brahmā age.
<div n="lb"/>The ages of two Brahmās constitute the age of one Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>At the end of the age Viṣṇu also will perish. The age
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva is double the age of Viṣṇu. Śiva also will perish
<div n="lb"/>at the end of his age. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 5).
<div n="NI"/>When everything perishes there comes the deluge (the
<div n="lb"/>great flood). After that, for one hundred and twenty
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā years the universe will be desolate and void. In
<div n="lb"/>that deep eternal silence, Viṣṇu will be seen sleeping on
<div n="lb"/>a banyan leaf on the surface of water. That is the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of the next great age. In this stage, Bāla-
<div n="lb"/>mukunda is the name of Mahāviṣṇu. As he remains on
<div n="lb"/>Nāra or water he will be called Nārāyaṇa also.
<div n="NI"/>The name Viṣṇu means he who possesses the habit of
<div n="lb"/>Vyāpana (To pervade). While Viṣṇu, who has the
<div n="lb"/>power to spread his control over everything in whatever
<div n="lb"/>condition, lies on the banyan-leaf. From his navel, a
<div n="lb"/>lotus-stalk grows up, and on the top of the stalk, in the
<div n="lb"/>lotus flower, Brahmā comes into being. Brahmā does
<div n="lb"/>penance before Viṣṇu and extols him. Mahāviṣṇu confers
<div n="lb"/>on Brahmā the power of creation of the subjects. That
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā perishes along with the deluge and in his place
<div n="lb"/>another Brahmā is born. Thus in the life-time of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>two Brahmās come into being and perish.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Beginning.%} In days of yore, when Viṣṇu was lying
<div n="lb"/>on the banyan leaf as Bāla Mukunda, he began to think
<div n="lb"/>“Who am I? Who created me? Why? What have I
<div n="lb"/>to perform?” -and soon an ethereal voice was heard,
<div n="lb"/>“I am everything. Except me, there is nothing eternal.”
<div n="lb"/>From behind the voice Mahādevī appeared, and said
<div n="lb"/>“Look Viṣṇu. What is there to wonder at? Whenever
<div n="lb"/>the universe is subject to creation, sustenance and
<div n="lb"/>extermination, you have taken origin by the glory of
<div n="lb"/>the Almighty. The Almighty or the omnipotence is
<div n="lb"/>beyond attributes. But we are all subjected to attributes.
<div n="lb"/>Your foremost attribute is Sattva (goodness-purity)
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā whose main attribute is the attribute of rajas
<div n="lb"/>(activity-passions), will originate from your navel.
<div n="lb"/>From the middle of the brows of that Brahmā, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>will be born, whose main attribute is Tamas (inertia
<div n="lb"/>darkness). Brahmā, by the power of Tapas (penance)
<div n="lb"/>will acquire the power of creation and build the world.
<div n="lb"/>You will be the sustainer of that world. Śiva will dest-
<div n="lb"/>roy the same world. I am Devī Māyā (Illusion-
<div n="lb"/>personified as the wife of Brahman), the great power
<div n="lb"/>depending on you for the purpose of creation.” After
<div n="lb"/>hearing these words of Devī, Viṣṇu went into medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion and deep sleep of contemplation.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Avatāras (Incarnations).%} When injustice and law-
<div n="lb"/>lessness abound in the universe, Viṣṇu will incarnate in
<div n="lb"/>the world in various forms and shapes, and will drive
<div n="lb"/>away injustice and will reinstate righteousness. The basis
<div n="lb"/>and the indeclinable semen virile of all the incarnations,
<div n="lb"/>is this spirit of the universe. All Devas, all human beings
<div n="lb"/>and all animals are created from a portion of this soul
<div n="lb"/>of the universe, which in itself is a portion. Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>first incarnated as Sanatkumāra and lived the life of a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin student of chaste abstinence. The second
[Page864-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>incarnation was connected with the creation of the
<div n="lb"/>earth. It was the incarnation as a hog to redeem the
<div n="lb"/>earth which was immersed in the world of Rasātala.
<div n="lb"/>The third incarnation was taken to create the sages and
<div n="lb"/>hermits. The Supreme God incarnated as the deva-
<div n="lb"/>hermit, Nārada and taught Pañcarātra, the Vaiṣṇava-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra explaining the ways of observing Karmans.
<div n="lb"/>Fourthly, Viṣṇu took the incarnation of Nara-Nārāy-
<div n="lb"/>aṇas (two hermits) and performed tapas (penance),
<div n="lb"/>difficult to do. The fifth incarnation was that of Kapila
<div n="lb"/>who taught his disciple Āsuri, a Brahmin, Sāṅkhya (one
<div n="lb"/>of the six systems of Indian philosophy dealing with
<div n="lb"/>evolution). The next incarnation was taken, according
<div n="lb"/>to the request of Atri, as his son under the name
<div n="lb"/>Dattātreya. Seventhly he took incarnation as Yajña, the
<div n="lb"/>son born to Prajāpati Ruci, by his wife Ākūti with the
<div n="lb"/>groups of devas (gods) such as Yāmas and others to
<div n="lb"/>sustain the Manvantara (age of Manu) of Svāyam-
<div n="lb"/>bhuva. The eighth incarnation was as the son of Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vān Nābhi by his wife Meru, and the ninth was, as the
<div n="lb"/>inner soul of Pṛthu, according to the request of the
<div n="lb"/>sages and hermits, with a view to change the earth to
<div n="lb"/>such a state that medicinal herbs may grow in plenty
<div n="lb"/>everywhere. The tenth was, as Matsya (Fish) in
<div n="lb"/>Cākṣuṣa Manvantara deluge; the eleventh, as turtle,
<div n="lb"/>to lift up the mountain Mandara; the twelfth as Dhan-
<div n="lb"/>vantari, and the thirteenth was as Mohinī (Charming
<div n="lb"/>woman). The fourteenth was that of Man-lion, the
<div n="lb"/>fifteenth was that of Vāmana, the sixteenth that of
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma, the seventeenth, that of Vyāsa, the eight-
<div n="lb"/>eenth, that of Śrī Rāma and the nineteenth was that of
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and the twentieth that of Kṛṣṇa in the dynasty of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣṇi. The twenty-first was as Buddha in the beginning
<div n="lb"/>of the age of Kali. The twenty second incarnation was
<div n="lb"/>in the name of Kalki as the son of the Brahmin Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>yaśas. Each incarnation is explained in places where
<div n="lb"/>that word occurs. See under Avatāra.
<div n="NI"/>The avatāras of Mahāviṣṇu are numerous. Thousands
<div n="lb"/>and thousands of incarnations originate from Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu as streams flow from a lake which overflows at all
<div n="lb"/>times. Hermits, Manus, Devas, Sons of Manus, Prajā-
<div n="lb"/>patis, all these are marks and portions of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Saṛga 15; Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 5; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Sarga 40; Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>83; Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1; M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 121; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 12; Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 10; Bhāgavata, Skandha 5; Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 272; Vana Parva, Chapter 149;
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 339).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family life.%} Vaikuṇṭha is the dwelling place of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. Mahālakṣmī is the prominent wife. It is seen in
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, that besides Laksmīdevī,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā Devī and Sarasvatī also were the wives of Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmīdevī has taken several incarnations. Once she
<div n="lb"/>took birth from Khyāti, the wife of hermit Bhrgu. At
<div n="lb"/>this birth Dhātā and Vidhātā were her brothers. On
<div n="lb"/>another occasion, she arose from a lotus-flower which
<div n="lb"/>grew up from the sea of Milk. (To know more about
<div n="lb"/>the wives Lakṣmī, Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī, see under
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā).
<div n="NI"/>There is none to be mentioned as the legitimate son of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. But Brahmā is the first that could be
<div n="lb"/>imagined as the son of Viṣṇu. Besides, Mahāviṣṇu once
<div n="lb"/>created a bright son, by his mind. That son was named
[Page865-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Virajas. Śāstā is another son of Mahāviṣṇu. Śiva be-
<div n="lb"/>came amorous with Mohinī (fascinating woman)—the
<div n="lb"/>form which Mahāviṣṇu took at the time of the churning
<div n="lb"/>of the Sea of Milk. They led a short family life as a
<div n="lb"/>result of which the son Śāstā was born. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Śāstā).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Curses.%} Mahāviṣṇu had cursed and had been cursed
<div n="lb"/>on many an occasion. The most important of them are
<div n="lb"/>given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%The curse of Mahālakṣmī%} Once Mahāviṣṇu looked
<div n="lb"/>into the face of Mahālakṣmī and laughed for no reason.
<div n="lb"/>Thinking that Mahāviṣṇu had been making fun of her,
<div n="lb"/>she cursed him saying “Let your head be severed from
<div n="lb"/>the body.”
<div n="NI"/>At this period an Asura named Hayagrīva had done
<div n="lb"/>penance for a thousand years and obtained several boons.
<div n="lb"/>One boon was that he should be killed only by a man with
<div n="lb"/>the head of a horse. Hayagrīva attacked the devas (gods).
<div n="lb"/>Though the gods fought with Hayagrīva for many thou-
<div n="lb"/>sands of years they could not kill him. Even Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>admitted defeat. Using the bow as a prop to his chin he
<div n="lb"/>stood thinking, for years. In the meanwhile white ants
<div n="lb"/>began to eat the string of the bow. When the string
<div n="lb"/>was broken, the bow straightened with a sudden jerk
<div n="lb"/>and the head of Mahāviṣṇu was severed from the trunk
<div n="lb"/>and was thrown away. Viśvakarmā cut off the head of
<div n="lb"/>a horse and joined it to the trunk of Viṣṇu, who instant-
<div n="lb"/>ly rose up and killed Hayagrīva. Thus satisfying the
<div n="lb"/>need of the gods and making the curse of Lakṣmī come
<div n="lb"/>true, Viṣṇu regained his original form and returned to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%The curse of Bhṛgu.%} The Asuras who were defeated in
<div n="lb"/>the war with Devas, approached Pulomā, the mother of
<div n="lb"/>their teacher-priest Śukra, and sought protection. Pulomā,
<div n="lb"/>was the wife of hermit Bhṛgu. She began to do penance
<div n="lb"/>for the destruction of devas. Knowing this Viṣṇu aimed
<div n="lb"/>his weapon, the Discus, at her and killed her. Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>got angry and cursed Viṣṇu to take birth as a man and
<div n="lb"/>suffer the grief of separation from his wife for many
<div n="lb"/>years. This curse was the first cause of the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Rāma. (For details see under Bhṛgu, Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%The curse of Viṣṇu.%} Once the handsome King Revan-
<div n="lb"/>ta, mounted on the horse Uccaiśśravas and came to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. Looking at the handsome youth, Lakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>stood for a while enchanted by Revanta and his horse.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu was displeased at this, and cursed her to
<div n="lb"/>take birth on the earth as a mare. Accordingly she was
<div n="lb"/>born as a mare and when the duration of the curse was
<div n="lb"/>over returned to Vaikuṇṭha. (For details see under
<div n="lb"/>Ekavīra).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%The curse of Vṛndā.%} See under Māyāśiva.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Contests and wars.%} Wars are very few in the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>in which Viṣṇu had not participated directly or indirect-
<div n="lb"/>ly. As almost all of them have been dealt with in
<div n="lb"/>various places in this book, they are not given here.
<div n="lb"/>Only a few of the prominent among them are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>here.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Madhukaiṭabhas.%} Madhu and Kaiṭabha are two
<div n="lb"/>asuras born from the ear-wax of Mahāviṣṇu. They
<div n="lb"/>tried to attack Brahmā and Viṣṇu killed them. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Kaiṭabha).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Killing of Andhaka.%} Andhaka was a notorious asura.
<div n="lb"/>He was the minister of Mahiṣāsura. When war broke
<div n="lb"/>out between asuras and Devas, Andhaka caused havoc
[Page865-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>among the devas. At last in the fight with Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka was killed. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 5).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Killing of Vṛtrāsura.%} See under Vṛtra.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Rāhu.%} For the story of how Viṣṇu cut into two the
<div n="lb"/>asura Rāhu, see under Amṛtam.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Contest with Brahmā.%} The story of Viṣṇu and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā making a competitive journey to find out the
<div n="lb"/>crest and foot of Śiva, is given with slight variations in
<div n="lb"/>most of the Purāṇas. (For detailed story see under
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Para 5).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%For the story of how Viṣṇu confronted the asuras Nemi,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Sumālī and Mālyavān%} see under each of those words.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The weapons and ornaments of Viṣṇu.%} The following
<div n="lb"/>are the prominent ornaments and weapons of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Śrīvatsa.%} This is a mark on the chest. It is said that
<div n="lb"/>this is the mark imprinted by the angry Bhṛgu who
<div n="lb"/>kicked on the chest of Mahāviṣṇu. (See under Bhṛgu).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Pāñcajanya.%} This is a white conch. Even by the
<div n="lb"/>touch of this conch man becomes wise. (For further
<div n="lb"/>details see under Pañcaja I).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%The Discus Sudarśana.%} Vajranābha is another
<div n="lb"/>name of this weapon. Viṣṇu uses this weapon to deal
<div n="lb"/>with fierce enemies. This is a wheel with a hole in the
<div n="lb"/>centre and thousand arms going out from the centre.
<div n="lb"/>The outer edge is sharp. This Sudarśana Cakra
<div n="lb"/>is operated by putting it on the first finger and turning
<div n="lb"/>it round, and releasing it at the enemy. Though it is
<div n="lb"/>terrible for the wicked and unjust, it forebodes good to
<div n="lb"/>good people and so it is Sudarśana (good to look at).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Kaumodakī.%} This is the club. The syllable “Ku”
<div n="lb"/>means the earth. Kumodaka means he who delights
<div n="lb"/>the earth. He who makes the earth delightful is Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>As the club is the property of Kumodaka (Viṣṇu) it is
<div n="lb"/>called Kaumodakī.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Kaustubha.%} This is the jewel of Mahāviṣṇu. (Ku =
<div n="lb"/>the Earth. Stubhnāti = Pervades (spreads). Kustubha =
<div n="lb"/>ocean. Kaustubha-obtained from the sea. This jewel
<div n="lb"/>obtained from the sea of milk at the time of its churn-
<div n="lb"/>ing, is worn by Mahāviṣṇu on his neck. This is a red
<div n="lb"/>Jacinth.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Nandaka.%} This is the sword of Viṣṇu. It is stated
<div n="lb"/>in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 166, that this
<div n="lb"/>sword was obtained from Indra.
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Śāraṅg.%} This is the name of the bow of Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>This is called Vaiṣṇavacāpa (the bow of Viṣṇu) also.
<div n="lb"/>A description is given in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla-
<div n="lb"/>kāṇḍa, Sarga 25, as to how this bow was obtained. It
<div n="lb"/>is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Once the Devas made Viṣṇu and Śiva quarrel with each
<div n="lb"/>other, to test their might. The fight between the two
<div n="lb"/>began. Viśvakarmā gave each of them a bow. The bow
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu was called Vaiṣṇavacāpa; the bow of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>was called Śaivacāpa. This Vaiṣṇavacāpa is Śārṅga.
<div n="lb"/>Due to the power of Śārṅga, Śiva was defeated in the
<div n="lb"/>fight. Getting angry Śiva gave his bow to the King
<div n="lb"/>Devarāta of Videha. It was this bow that Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>broke at the time of the Svayaṃvara marriage of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>After the fight, Viṣṇu gave his bow to Ṛcīka. That bow
<div n="lb"/>changed hands from Ṛcīka to Jamadagni and from him
<div n="lb"/>to Paraśurāma, who presented this bow to Śrī Rāma on
<div n="lb"/>his return after the marriage with Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Vaijayantī.%} This is the necklace of Viṣṇu. This
<div n="lb"/>necklace, made of five jewels stuck together, is known
<div n="lb"/>by the name Vanamālā, also. Viṣṇu has a charioteer
<div n="lb"/>named Dāruka and four horses named Śaibya, Sugrīva,
[Page866-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Meghapuṣpa and Valāhaka. Garuḍa is the conveyance
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. He holds conch, discus, club and lotus in
<div n="lb"/>each of his four hands. It is said that the discus was
<div n="lb"/>made by Viśvakarmā with the dust of the Sun. In
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa particular mention is made about the
<div n="lb"/>ornaments of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The names of Viṣṇu.%} The names of Viṣṇu given in

<div n="NI"/>46) Muramardana. He who had suppressed Mura.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Sahasra Nāmans.%} (Thousand names of Viṣṇu). The
<div n="lb"/>list of thousand names of Viṣṇu, is present in Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa, Chapter 72. In Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 149, also all the thousand
<div n="lb"/>names are given. Variations are seen in these two lists.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Other details%} (i) Mention about Mahāviṣṇu occurs
<div n="lb"/>in several places in Ṛgveda. But more prominence is
<div n="lb"/>given to Indra. Though Viṣṇu is exalted in five Ṛgveda
<div n="lb"/>mantras (incantations), when compared with other gods,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu is only a lesser god. The story of Trivikrama is
<div n="lb"/>hinted in Ṛgveda. But there is no mention about the
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Vāmana or Mahābali. Ṛgveda gives
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu only the position of a younger brother of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. That is why the author of Amarakośa has given
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu synonyms such as Upendra, Indrāvaraja etc.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahāviṣṇu was one of those who came to see
<div n="lb"/>Śivaliṅga (Phallus) when it was detached and fell down
<div n="lb"/>at the curse of hermit Bhṛgu. (For details see under
<div n="lb"/>Śiva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Mahāviṣṇu gave Subrahmaṇya as attendants two
<div n="lb"/>Vidyādharas named Vardhana and Nandana. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Mahāviṣṇu gave Subrahmaṇya the necklace Vaija-
<div n="lb"/>yantī. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 49).
<div n="NI"/>(v) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>11, Stanza 25, that Mahāviṣṇu stays in the assembly of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā.
[Page867-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Mahāviṣṇu showed grace to Uparicara vasu. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 337, Stanza 33).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Mahāviṣṇu once took birth as the son of Aditi.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards he got the name Āditya also. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see under Aditi). For further details regarding
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu, see under Virāṭpuruṣa, Prakṛti, Puruṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmasṛṣṭi, Avatāra, Amṛta, Garuḍa, Lakṣmī, Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>etc.
