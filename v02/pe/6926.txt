SUDARŚANA¦ XIV. (The Discus Sudarśana-weapon).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The weapon of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Two stories are seen about the origin of this weapon.
<div n="NI"/>(i) The sun married Saṃjñā the daughter of Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>karmā. Saṃjñā complained to her father that she could
<div n="lb"/>not bear the radiance of the Sun. Viśvakarmā put the
<div n="lb"/>Sun in a turning machine and turned him and decreas-
<div n="lb"/>ed his radiance. Out of the dust of the sun produced
<div n="lb"/>by this process, Viśvakarmā made the discus-weapon,
<div n="lb"/>the aerial chariot Puṣpaka, the Trident of Śiva, and
<div n="lb"/>the Śakti (lance) of Subrahmaṇya. Of these weapons
<div n="lb"/>the discus-weapon Sudarśana was given to Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>This is one story. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the burning of the forest Khāṇḍava, Indra
<div n="lb"/>showered rain, against the fire. According to the second
<div n="lb"/>story, the God Fire gave the discus weapon Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Gāṇḍīva to Arjuna to fight
<div n="lb"/>against Indra. (See the word Khāṇḍavadāha).
<div n="NI"/>Besides these two stories, several statements occur in
<div n="lb"/>various Purāṇas, about this weapon Sudarśana. As
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana was in existence even before the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the story that Viśvakarmā made it, ought
<div n="lb"/>to be given prominence. Very often Mahāviṣṇu used to
<div n="lb"/>destroy enemies by this Sudarśana. Though Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>had taken several incarnations, only Śrī Kṛṣṇa is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Purāṇas as having used this weapon
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana very often.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The power of Sudarśana.%} Sudarśana flies up to the
<div n="lb"/>ranks of the enemies, burning like fire. Once Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu sent the weapon Sudarśana towards the asuras.
<div n="lb"/>Then the havoc and destruction caused by this weapon,
<div n="lb"/>is described as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The moment he thought of Sudarśana, to destroy the
<div n="lb"/>power of the enemy, it made its appearance like the
<div n="lb"/>Sun in the Solar region. It was a fearful sight. Emanat-
<div n="lb"/>ing light and radiance from the blazing fire, the
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana rested on the hand of Viṣṇu; turning round
<div n="lb"/>with a tremendous speed. Viṣṇu threw it at the
<div n="lb"/>enemies with his powerful hand like that of the trunk
<div n="lb"/>of an elephant, with a view to cleave the city of the
<div n="lb"/>enemies into pieces. That weapon which was burning
<div n="lb"/>in great flames like a great fire spreading radiance,
<div n="lb"/>flew into the midst of the enemy's army and instantly
<div n="lb"/>every one near it fell dead. Thus it flew about among
<div n="lb"/>the asuras and burnt them to ashes. Then turning
<div n="lb"/>round and round in the air it drank the blood shed
<div n="lb"/>on the earth. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 19).
