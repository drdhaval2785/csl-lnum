ĀPASTAMBA¦. An ancient sage. He once consoled
<div n="lb"/>King Dyumatsena. (Śloka 18, Chapter 298, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How he got his name.%} Once a brahmin did not get
<div n="lb"/>a suitable man to officiate as priest for a śrāddha cere-
<div n="lb"/>mony. He then prayed to his ancestors, Viśvedevas
<div n="lb"/>and Mahāviṣṇu for help and then Āpastamba appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him. The brahmin gave him food to his heart's
<div n="lb"/>content and asked him how he felt. To the surprise of
<div n="lb"/>the brahmin Āpastamba replied, he wanted some more
<div n="lb"/>and thus made the Śrāddha ineffective. The brahmin
<div n="lb"/>got angry and cursed him by sprinkling on his face
<div n="lb"/>water taken in his palm. But before the water-particles
<div n="lb"/>reached his face Āpastamba ordered the water-drops to
<div n="lb"/>remain still. Water stopped stiff and still midway by
<div n="lb"/>the power of the sage. Because water (Āpa) became
<div n="lb"/>stiff (Stamba) the ṛṣi was named Āpastamba. (Brahma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Āpastamba tīrtha came into existence.%} Once he met
<div n="lb"/>Agastya Muni and asked him who was superior among
<div n="lb"/>the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. Agastya declared
<div n="lb"/>that Śiva stood supreme of the lot and gave him advice
<div n="lb"/>as to how to please Śiva. Following his instructions
<div n="lb"/>Āpastamba did penance on the banks of the river Gau-
<div n="lb"/>tamī and Śiva appeared before him, blessed him, and
<div n="lb"/>made that place a holy one. Śiva declared that those
<div n="lb"/>who, bathed at that place would obtain ‘Divyajñāna’
<div n="lb"/>(Divine knowledge enabling one to know the past,
<div n="lb"/>present and future). From then onwards that place
<div n="lb"/>was known as Āpastamba tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} Āpastamba had a very chaste and
<div n="lb"/>humble wife named Akṣasūtrā. Their son was Gārki.
<div n="lb"/>‘Gṛhyasūtrasaṃgraha’ containing a prayer and two man-
<div n="lb"/>tras is a contribution to the holy science by Āpastamba.
<div n="lb"/>Many Hindus follow it even now. He had stated
<div n="lb"/>that the decrease in the number of great sages was
<div n="lb"/>because of the fact that people were not practising the
<div n="lb"/>control of the senses as before.
