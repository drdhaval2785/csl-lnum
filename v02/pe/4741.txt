NARA I¦. A hermit of divine power.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Brahmā created Dharmadeva from his
<div n="lb"/>breast. Truthful and righteous Dharma married ten
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa. Several sons were born to Dharma
<div n="lb"/>of his ten wives. But foremost among them were Hari,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, Nara and Nārāyaṇa. Hari and Kṛṣṇa became
<div n="lb"/>great yogins and Nara and Nārāyaṇa became great
<div n="lb"/>hermits of penance. The Nara-Nārāyaṇas lived in the
<div n="lb"/>holy Asylum of Badarikāśrama in the vicinity of the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas for a thousand years performing penance to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. (Devī Bhāgavata. Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Giving birth to Urvaśī.%} See under Urva ī, Para 1.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Keeper of Amṛta (Ambrosia).%} The Devas (gods) and
<div n="lb"/>the asuras (demons) together churned the sea of milk
<div n="lb"/>and obtained Ambrosia (the celestial nectar of immortal-
<div n="lb"/>ity). Mahāviṣṇu took the guise of a fascinating woman
<div n="lb"/>and obtained the Amṛta by stealth from the asuras
<div n="lb"/>and gave it to the devas. The asuras waged a terrible
<div n="lb"/>war with the devas. At that time, at the request of
<div n="lb"/>the devas, Nara and Nārāyaṇa took sides with the
<div n="lb"/>devas, and fought against the asuras as a consequence
<div n="lb"/>of which the asuras were defeated. In Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 19, Stanza 31, it is stated that
<div n="lb"/>from that day onwards Indra entrusted the keeping
<div n="lb"/>of the celestial Nectar with the hermit named Nara.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Dambhodbhava brought under control.%} See under
<div n="lb"/>Dambhodbhava).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Conflict with Śiva.%} Because he was not invited to the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice by Dakṣa, Śiva got angry and sent his trident
<div n="lb"/>against Dakṣa's sacrifice. The trident completely des-
<div n="lb"/>troyed the sacrifice and flew through the air here and
<div n="lb"/>there. Then it reached Badaryāśrama and hit the breast
<div n="lb"/>of Nārāyaṇa who was sitting engaged in penance. By
[Page525-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the force of the utterance of the sound ‘Hum’, made
<div n="lb"/>by Nārāyaṇa, the trident was ejected from his breast.
<div n="lb"/>Finding no accommodation there it flew back to Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>who getting angry at this rebut approached Nara-
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇas with the intention of exterminating them.
<div n="lb"/>Nara took a grass from the ground and discharged it at
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Instantly the grass became an axe. It flew round
<div n="lb"/>Śiva to attack him. Śiva broke the axe. From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards Śiva got the name ‘Khaṇḍaparaśu’ (one who
<div n="lb"/>broke the axe). In this story it is said that the trident
<div n="lb"/>which had returned from the breast of Nārāyaṇa heated
<div n="lb"/>the hair of Śiva to such an extent that they were
<div n="lb"/>dried as dry grass. So Śiva came to be called ‘Muñja-
<div n="lb"/>keśa’ (with hair having the colour of dry grass). (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 343).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Fight with Prahlāda.%} Once Cyavana the son of Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>went to Nākuleśvara tīrtha (Bath) to take his bath in
<div n="lb"/>the river Narmadā. As soon as he got into the water
<div n="lb"/>the serpent called Kekaralohita caught hold of him.
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana meditated on Viṣṇu. So the poison of the ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent did not affect him. The huge serpent dragged
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana to Pātāla (the Nether world). But as his
<div n="lb"/>poison did not affect the hermit the serpent left the
<div n="lb"/>prey and went away. The Nāga damsels welcomed
<div n="lb"/>him and showed hospitality. Being greeted by the Nāga
<div n="lb"/>damsels he travelled through Pātāla and reached the
<div n="lb"/>great city of Dānavas. The asura chiefs greeted him with
<div n="lb"/>respect. Prahlāda met Cyavana, and received him with
<div n="lb"/>pleasure. The hermit said to Prahlāda. “I came to bathe
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahātīrtha and worship Nākuleśvara. When I
<div n="lb"/>got into the river a serpent caught hold of me and
<div n="lb"/>brought me to Pātāla, and made it possible for me to
<div n="lb"/>meet you.” Hearing these words of Cyavana the King
<div n="lb"/>of the asuras said: “Oh good Lord! which are the holy
<div n="lb"/>baths in the earth, the sky and the Pātāla? Would you
<div n="lb"/>be pleased to tell us?” Cyavana replied: “Oh! power-
<div n="lb"/>ful and mighty King! The holy baths are Naimiṣa on
<div n="lb"/>the earth, Puṣkara on the sky and Cakra tīrtha in Pātāla;
<div n="lb"/>these are the most important ones.”
<div n="NI"/>The King of the Daityas decided to go to Naimiṣa and
<div n="lb"/>said:—“We must go and bathe in the Naimiṣa tīrtha.
<div n="lb"/>We could visit and worship Viṣṇu with eyes as beautiful
<div n="lb"/>as lotus.” Obeying the words of the King, preparations
<div n="lb"/>were made instantly and the asuras started from Rasā-
<div n="lb"/>tala for Naimiṣa.
<div n="NI"/>The mighty host of Daityas and Dānavas reached
<div n="lb"/>Naimiṣa and bathed in the tīrtha. After that Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest for hunting. As he was walking thus
<div n="lb"/>he saw the river Sarasvatī. Near the river there was a
<div n="lb"/>Pine tree with very big branches, all of which were
<div n="lb"/>covered with arrows, the head of one at the tail of ano-
<div n="lb"/>ther. Prahlāda saw near the tree two hermits, with
<div n="lb"/>matted hair, clad in the hide of black antelope, perform-
<div n="lb"/>ing penance. Near them were two perfectly made divine
<div n="lb"/>bows named Śārṅga and Ajagava and two quivers which
<div n="lb"/>would never become empty. Prahlāda questioned them
<div n="lb"/>without knowing that they were Nara and Nārāyaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The questioning ended in a contest. The hermit Nara
<div n="lb"/>stood up and taking the bow Ajagava began sending
<div n="lb"/>showers of arrows at Prahlāda. Prahlāda checked every
<div n="lb"/>one of them. The hermit made his fight more severe.
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda also withstood it. At last pushing Nara back
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa came to the front. The fight between Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>and Nārāyaṇa was fierce. In the end Prahlāda fell down,
<div n="lb"/>his breast being pierced by the arrow of Nārāyaṇa.
[Page526-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda realized that the hermit Nārāyaṇa was none
<div n="lb"/>but Viṣṇu. He praised Nārāyaṇa (Vāmana Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) On the occasion of the stripping of Pāñcālī of her
<div n="lb"/>clothes at the palace of the Kauravas, Pāñcālī cried,
<div n="lb"/>calling Nara and Nārāyaṇa. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 68, Stanza 46).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa were the rebirths of Nara
<div n="lb"/>and Nārāyaṇa. (See under Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>334, Stanza 9, that the hermit Nara was one of the
<div n="lb"/>four incarnations taken by Mahāviṣṇu in the Manuṣya
<div n="lb"/>yuga (age of man) of the Svāyambhuva Manvantara.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) It is mentioned in Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2, that, of the two viz. Nara and Nārāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Nara was of fair complexion and Nārāyaṇa of dark
<div n="lb"/>complexion.
<div n="NI"/>(v) It was because of the curse of the hermit Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>that Nara-Nārāyaṇas took birth as Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>in the Dvāparayuga. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) The meaning of the word ‘Nara’ is he who is not
<div n="lb"/>damaged. The universal soul named Nara has created
<div n="lb"/>water and so water got the name ‘Nāram’. Because he
<div n="lb"/>lives in that water which has the name Nāram, the uni-
<div n="lb"/>versal soul got the name Nārāyaṇa. (Manusmṛti, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>1 Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) For the other incarnations of Nara see under
<div n="lb"/>Raktaja.
