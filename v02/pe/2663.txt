HEMAKŪṬA¦ (M) II. A mountain on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river Nandā, known also as Ṛṣabhakūṭa. Once Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira went to this mountain and enjoyed the many
<div n="lb"/>beautiful scenes there. (See Ṛṣabha II).
<div n="NI"/>HEMAMĀLĪ I. He used to supply flowers to Vaiśra-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇa. He had a beautiful wife called Viśālākṣī. Once
<div n="lb"/>when he returned with flowers from Mānasasaras he
<div n="lb"/>felt an onrush of love and spent time at home in love
<div n="lb"/>pranks with his wife. Kubera went to the temple for
<div n="lb"/>worshipping Śiva at noon and though he waited there
<div n="lb"/>till dusk time for Hemamālī to bring the flowers the latter
<div n="lb"/>did not come. Kubera got angry and sent for Hema-
<div n="lb"/>mālī and he came trembling with fear. Kubera's curse
<div n="lb"/>turned him into a leper afflicted with eighteen varieties
<div n="lb"/>of leprosy, and separated from wife he fell from Alakā-
<div n="lb"/>purī. At last he came to Hemādri where he met sage
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya. Hemamālī told him all about his misfor-
<div n="lb"/>tune and the sage advised him to observe Āṣāḍha-
<div n="lb"/>kṛṣṇaikādasī. Hemamālī did so and got cured of the
<div n="lb"/>fell disease and returned to Devaloka. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Uttarakhaṇḍa, Chapter 54).
