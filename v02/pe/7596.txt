TRIŚIRAS¦ II (VIŚVARŪPA). Once there was a celebrat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Prajāpati of name Tvaṣṭā. Though he was of a pious
<div n="lb"/>nature interested in the welfare of Brahmins, he hated
<div n="lb"/>Indra. He thought of destroying Indra somehow. With
<div n="lb"/>that purpose in view he produced by his wife Recanā,
<div n="lb"/>a powerful son and named him Viśvarūpa. The boy had
<div n="lb"/>three heads and so he was called Triśiras (Tri=Three
<div n="lb"/>Śiras—head) also. He could use his three heads for
<div n="lb"/>three different purposes at a time. He would drink wine
<div n="lb"/>with one head and mutter the Veda-mantras by another
<div n="lb"/>head and see the world by the third.
<div n="NI"/>Even from boyhood he disliked worldly pleasures and,
<div n="lb"/>abandoning even food, started to do penance. During
<div n="lb"/>the hot season he would sit amidst fire and during the
<div n="lb"/>cold season he would sit in water to do penance. He
<div n="lb"/>would stand with his head down and do penance. The
<div n="lb"/>penance of Triśiras was so severe that Indra began to
<div n="lb"/>get frightened. He sent celestial maidens to stop the
<div n="lb"/>penance but all the attempts proved futile before that
<div n="lb"/>great ascetic. Then Indra himself riding on Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>went and killed the sage by his Vajrāyudha. Indra
<div n="lb"/>feared whether Triśiras would come to life again and
<div n="lb"/>wreak vengeance on him. So he ordered a carpenter
<div n="lb"/>standing nearby to bring to him the three heads separat-
<div n="lb"/>ed from the body. The carpenter cut off the heads from
<div n="lb"/>the body and as each head fell to the ground several
<div n="lb"/>kinds of birds were found escaping from it. From the
<div n="lb"/>head which used to mutter Vedic mantras rose the
<div n="lb"/>Kapiñjala birds; from the head used for drinking wine
<div n="lb"/>rose Kalapiṅga birds and from the third rose the Tittiri
<div n="lb"/>birds. When the birds thus rose to the air Indra was
<div n="lb"/>convinced that Triśiras was dead and he went away
<div n="lb"/>See under Viśvarūpa. (6th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
