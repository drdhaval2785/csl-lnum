CAÑCALĀKṢĪ II¦. A vidyādhara girl. Once while she
<div n="lb"/>was concentrating her mind in prayer over Mahālaksmī,
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, King of the Rākṣasas, committed rape on her,
<div n="lb"/>and she cursed him that he should die on account of
<div n="lb"/>Mahālakṣmī herself and accordingly at last he was
<div n="lb"/>killed by Rāma on account of Sītā, the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Mahālakṣmī. (Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa).
