PARVATA I¦. A sage who was the nephew of Nārada.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Marīci—Paurṇamāsa—Parvata.
<div n="NI"/>Prajāpati Marīci got of his wife Sambhūti a son named
<div n="lb"/>Paurṇamāsa. Paurṇamāsa got two sons Virajas and
<div n="lb"/>Parvata. Parvata's mother was the sister of Nārada.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 10, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Nārada and Parvata.%} These two sages lived for a
<div n="lb"/>long time as inseparable friends. Once they travelled on
<div n="lb"/>earth in the form of human beings. They decided that
<div n="lb"/>each should speak out what he felt without reserve and
<div n="lb"/>if anybody broke the arrangement the other had the
<div n="lb"/>right to curse him.
<div n="NI"/>During their travels they reached the palace of a King
<div n="lb"/>called Sṛñjaya (Sañjaya) and they stayed there as his
<div n="lb"/>guests for a long time. Damayantī (Madayantī)
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the King served them both and Nārada
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with her. Nārada hid this fact from
<div n="lb"/>Parvata and within a few days Parvata came to know
<div n="lb"/>it and he according to the agreement cursed Nārada to
<div n="lb"/>take the form of a monkey. Nārada gave a counter
<div n="lb"/>curse disabling Parvata from attaining Svarga. Both
<div n="lb"/>separated from there and after some time both lost their
<div n="lb"/>bitterness against each other. Parvata met Nārada in
<div n="lb"/>his monkey form in a forest. Both were sorry for their
<div n="lb"/>curses then and each withdrew his curse and Nārada
<div n="lb"/>got his original form. He married Damayantī and
<div n="lb"/>started living together and Parvata went to Svarga.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 30, Śānti Parva).
