PṚTHU I¦. (VAINYA). A King of great virtue born in
<div n="lb"/>the line of Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Svāyambhuva Manu—Uttānapāda—Dhruva
<div n="lb"/>Śiṣṭi—Ripu—Cākṣuṣa Manu—Kuru—Aṅga—Vena—
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu.
<div n="NI"/>Manu, son of Cākṣuṣa, got of his wife Naḍvalā eleven
<div n="lb"/>sons Puru, Kuru, Pūru, Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vāk, Śuci, Agniṣṭu, Atiratha, Sudyumna and
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu. Of these the second son Kuru got of his
<div n="lb"/>wife Ātreyī seven sons named Aṅga, Sumanas, Svāti
<div n="lb"/>Kratu, Aṅgiras, Gaya and Śibi. Aṅga married Sunīthā.
<div n="lb"/>She delivered a very wicked son named Vena. Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>was born to Vena. Pṛthu got six sons named Antar-
<div n="lb"/>dhāna, Vādī, Sūta, Māgadha, Pālita and Vijitāśva.
[Page608-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and Coronation.%} Sunīthā, wife of Aṅga, was
<div n="lb"/>the eldest daughter of Yama. Vena was born of her.
<div n="lb"/>Vena, the grandson of Yama, because of hereditary
<div n="lb"/>traits from his grandfather, was very wicked even from
<div n="lb"/>birth. When Vena was crowned king by the maharṣis
<div n="lb"/>and he became the supreme lord of the world he an-
<div n="lb"/>nounced to the world thus: “Yāgas should not be per-
<div n="lb"/>formed; gifts should not be given; no kind of homa
<div n="lb"/>should be done. There is nobody but me to accept as
<div n="lb"/>Yajñapuruṣa the share of yajñas. I am the sole lord and
<div n="lb"/>consumer of yajñas.”
<div n="NI"/>The sages were dumbfounded. They all approached
<div n="lb"/>Vena and impressed upon him the necessity of perform-
<div n="lb"/>ing a Yāga to propitiate Mahāviṣṇu. Vena who got
<div n="lb"/>angry at this request of the sages told them thus:
<div n="lb"/>“There is nobody greater than I and I have none to be
<div n="lb"/>worshipped. Who is Hari, your Yajñeśvara? (lord of
<div n="lb"/>the yāga). All such great powers who can bless and
<div n="lb"/>curse alike and such eminent deities and entities like
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, Indra, Vāyu, Yama, Varuṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya, Agni, Dhātā, Pūṣā, Bhūmi and Candra are
<div n="lb"/>merged in me, the king. Do understand this fact and
<div n="lb"/>obey my orders.”
<div n="NI"/>Despite repeated requests Vena did not give permission
<div n="lb"/>to conduct a Vaiṣṇava yajña. The sages got angry and
<div n="lb"/>cried aloud “Kill this wicked man”, “Kill this wicked
<div n="lb"/>man”. Saying thus the sages killed Vena by Kuśa grass
<div n="lb"/>made sacred and powerful by mantras—Vena, who was
<div n="lb"/>spiritually dead because of his contempt of the gods
<div n="lb"/>even before. Then the sages saw dust rising in columns
<div n="lb"/>from all sides and asked the people the cause of the
<div n="lb"/>same. The people said “When they knew that there was
<div n="lb"/>no king poor people have turned themselves into rogues
<div n="lb"/>and are plundering the wealth of the rich. The swift
<div n="lb"/>movements of these running in haste are raising dust
<div n="lb"/>from the ground below.”
<div n="NI"/>The ṛṣis conferred together and to get a son from
<div n="lb"/>the dead Vena they churned the thigh of the wicked
<div n="lb"/>king. Then from the thigh came out a short and black
<div n="lb"/>(as black as a burnt pillar) man with a compressed face
<div n="lb"/>who stood before the sages in distress and asked “What
<div n="lb"/>am I to do?” The sages said ‘Niṣīda’ meaning ‘sit
<div n="lb"/>down’. He thus became Niṣāda (an illiterate forest-
<div n="lb"/>dweller). He went to the mountain of Vindhya and
<div n="lb"/>along with him went all the sins of Vena. Niṣādas there-
<div n="lb"/>after are said to be those who have destroyed the sins
<div n="lb"/>of Vena.
<div n="NI"/>Then the sages churned the right hand of Vena and
<div n="lb"/>from it came out a brilliant boy of great strength and
<div n="lb"/>power and he was named Pṛthu. At the time of his
<div n="lb"/>birth there dropped from heaven the divine bow Aja-
<div n="lb"/>gava and many powerful arrows and a divine armour.
<div n="lb"/>All animate objects of the world were happy at his birth.
<div n="lb"/>Vena attained svarga for having delivered such a brilli-
<div n="lb"/>ant son. For the coronation of Pṛthu the oceans brought
<div n="lb"/>very many precious diamonds and the rivers holy water.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā along with Āṅgirases came and crowned Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>as the emperor. Brahmā saw the line of Candra in his
<div n="lb"/>right hand and was, therefore, pleased to know that he
<div n="lb"/>was part of Mahāviṣṇu. Thus Pṛthu, valiant and brill-
<div n="lb"/>iant, was crowned their emperor by the virtuous people
<div n="lb"/>of Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>He united his people by his love for them. When he
<div n="lb"/>travelled through the ocean the water stood still and
[Page609-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>when he travelled on land the mountains gave way and
<div n="lb"/>his flag-pole was never obstructed anywhere.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sūta-Māgadhas.%} Brahmā performed a yāga as soon
<div n="lb"/>as Pṛthu was born. From that yāga was born a very
<div n="lb"/>wise and intelligent demon named Sūta. A scholarly
<div n="lb"/>Māgadha also was born from the yāga. The maharṣis
<div n="lb"/>commanded the Sūta-Māgadhas to praise Pṛthu and
<div n="lb"/>they then said “Oh revered sages, we do not know
<div n="lb"/>anything good or bad about this king just born. He
<div n="lb"/>has not earned a name or fame. Then on what basis
<div n="lb"/>are we to sing praises about him?” The maharṣis said
<div n="lb"/>that they should praise him for the qualities he should
<div n="lb"/>have in future. Pṛthu heard that and feeling elated
<div n="lb"/>decided to become a very virtuous emperor. When
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu was thinking like that the Sūta-Māgadhas sang
<div n="lb"/>in melodious tones thus: “This king speaks the truth
<div n="lb"/>always, is charitable, is one who keeps his promises,
<div n="lb"/>is valiant and full of all good qualities.” Thus with the
<div n="lb"/>blessings and good wishes of all, Pṛthu started his reign.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Pṛthu attacks the Earth.%} The people were hungry
<div n="lb"/>for want of proper food crops. They approached Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>and told him that during the short interval between
<div n="lb"/>Vena's death and Pṛthu's assuming charge the goddess
<div n="lb"/>of earth drew inside all her vegetations and so the peo-
<div n="lb"/>ple were put to great difficulties. They requested him
<div n="lb"/>to generate vegetations again.
<div n="NI"/>Pṛthu got angry on hearing this and taking his bow
<div n="lb"/>Ajagava and several arrows went in search of the god-
<div n="lb"/>dess of earth. The goddess got frightened and fled taking
<div n="lb"/>the form of a cow. She went to all lokas but Pṛthu fol-
<div n="lb"/>lowed her with his bow and arrows everywhere. At last
<div n="lb"/>desiring to escape from the arrows of such a valiant
<div n="lb"/>king Bhūmidevī went to him and trembling with fear said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh king, why do you make such a persistent attempt,
<div n="lb"/>to kill me which would be the great sin of Strīvadha?
<div n="lb"/>(killing a woman).” The Rājā replied that there was
<div n="lb"/>no sin in killing wicked persons. The goddess asked
<div n="lb"/>what refuge was there for the people if the earth was
<div n="lb"/>destroyed. The king said that he would protect his
<div n="lb"/>people by the power of his yoga. Bhūmidevī was fright-
<div n="lb"/>ened and she said “Oh king, I shall give you back all
<div n="lb"/>I have destroyed in the form of milk. Therefore, virt-
<div n="lb"/>uous as you are, if you are really interested in the wel-
<div n="lb"/>fare of the people I shall allow you to milk me and
<div n="lb"/>take back everything you want. Do bring a calf.”
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Pṛthu milks the Earth.%} Pṛthu by the end of his bow
<div n="lb"/>put in arrangement at one place the thousands of
<div n="lb"/>mountains which were lying scattered over the country.
<div n="lb"/>The grounds were not even and so there were formerly
<div n="lb"/>no divisions into villages and towns. There were no
<div n="lb"/>grain-plants like paddy or wheat, no agriculture, no
<div n="lb"/>cow-protection and no trade. It was since the time of
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu that all these came into being. People desired
<div n="lb"/>to live in places where the grounds were even. Then
<div n="lb"/>the people lived on fruits, leaves and roots. When they
<div n="lb"/>were all destroyed people found it difficult to live.
<div n="NI"/>Therefore Pṛthu making Svāyambhuva Manu as calf
<div n="lb"/>milked for the welfare of his people all plants from the
<div n="lb"/>earth. People do live even today by what was milked
<div n="lb"/>then. Pṛthu, because he gave life to Bhūmidevī,
<div n="lb"/>became her father and she got the name Pṛthvī.
<div n="NI"/>The brahmin sages milked the cow of earth again.
<div n="lb"/>Then Agastya became the calf and Bṛhaspati milked.
<div n="lb"/>When the planets milked, Candra became the calf and
[Page609-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>again Bṛhaspati milked. The devas even now feed on
<div n="lb"/>the Ūrjjakṣīra (milk rich in food value) they got then.
<div n="lb"/>All the animals live because of their virtue and truth.
<div n="lb"/>The ṛṣis milked truth and virtue. The manes made
<div n="lb"/>Yama the calf and Antaka the milker. They milked
<div n="lb"/>Svadhā in a silver pot. The cobras and serpents
<div n="lb"/>making Takṣaka the calf milked poison making
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra the milker. They live by their poison
<div n="lb"/>which is their great defence also. The daityas and
<div n="lb"/>dānavas using Virocana as calf and making the two-
<div n="lb"/>headed Ṛtvik Madhu as the milker milked jointly
<div n="lb"/>courage, valour and the sarvaśatruvināśinī māyā
<div n="lb"/>(māyā, the destroyer of all enemies). They milked in
<div n="lb"/>an iron pot. All their knowledge, bodily health,
<div n="lb"/>strength, vigour, brilliance and valour are made from
<div n="lb"/>this and that is why they are adepts in the art of
<div n="lb"/>māyā even now.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣas milked in an iron pot milk that disappeared
<div n="lb"/>from the earth. Rajatanābha milked using Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>as calf. That Yakṣarājaputra was sarvajña (knowing
<div n="lb"/>all) and Sarvadharmajña (conversant with all charitable
<div n="lb"/>things) with two heads and eight hands. The rākṣasas,
<div n="lb"/>piśācas and wicked maruts using Rajatanābha as milker
<div n="lb"/>and Sumālī as the calf milked blood in a pot made of a
<div n="lb"/>skull. They live on this.
<div n="NI"/>The Gandharvas and nymphs using lotus as their pot,
<div n="lb"/>Suruci as milker and Citraratha as calf milked music
<div n="lb"/>from her. The mountains making Mahāmeru as milker
<div n="lb"/>and Himālayas as the calf milked diamonds and
<div n="lb"/>medicines. The sacred trees made Sāla the milker and
<div n="lb"/>plakṣa the calf and milked in a pot of palāśa Chinna-
<div n="lb"/>dagdhaprarohaṇa (the power of growing again even
<div n="lb"/>if cut or burnt). The siddhaguhyakacāraṇavidyādharas
<div n="lb"/>also milked her each using different pots, calves and
<div n="lb"/>milkers and they all got what they wanted.
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Aśvamedha.%} Pṛthu's land became rich and
<div n="lb"/>prosperous. Then he performed an Aśvamedha. The
<div n="lb"/>Yāga horse was led by Vijitāśva, son of Pṛthu. Indra
<div n="lb"/>did not like Pṛthu conducting the yāga. Indra hid at
<div n="lb"/>a place on the path of the yāga horse. The sage Atri
<div n="lb"/>helped Indra. Indra bound the horse and a fight
<div n="lb"/>ensued between Indra and Vijitāśva in which Indra
<div n="lb"/>was deplorably defeated and confessing his guilt he
<div n="lb"/>craved for pardon and Pṛthu granting him pardon
<div n="lb"/>became his great friend. (4th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Pṛthu's rule.%} In the history of Bhārata the period
<div n="lb"/>of Pṛthu's rule is considered a golden period. When
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu became the emperor, Brahmā divided the uni-
<div n="lb"/>verse into several kingdoms and made a separate ruler
<div n="lb"/>for each of them. Soma was appointed King of the
<div n="lb"/>stars, planets, brahmins, plants, yāgas and austerities.
<div n="lb"/>He appointed Kubera as the lord of Kings, Varuṇa as
<div n="lb"/>the lord of all waters, Viṣṇu, as the lord of all ādityas
<div n="lb"/>and Pāvaka as the lord of all Vasus. Dakṣa was given
<div n="lb"/>lordship over prajāpatis, Indra over maruts, and
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda over all daityas and dānavas. Yama, the
<div n="lb"/>Dharmarāja was made lord of the manes. Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>was made King of all elephants and Garuḍa King of
<div n="lb"/>all birds. Uccaiśśravas was made King of all horses
<div n="lb"/>and Vṛṣabha of all cattle. The lion was made King of
<div n="lb"/>all beasts and Himavān the lord of all immovable
<div n="lb"/>things. Kapila became chief of all sages and the tiger
<div n="lb"/>the leader of all beasts with nails and snouts. Plakṣa
<div n="lb"/>was made the King of all trees.
<div n="NI"/>After distributing kingdoms thus, Brahmā appointed
[Page610-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Dikpālakas (guardians of the zones). In the east he
<div n="lb"/>posted Sudhanvā, son of Vairājaprajāpati, in the
<div n="lb"/>south he posted Śaṅkhapāda son of Kardamaprajāpati,
<div n="lb"/>in the west he put Ketumān, son of Rajas and in the
<div n="lb"/>north Hiraṇyaromā. Thus Brahmā organised a
<div n="lb"/>universe with suitable emperors to control and super-
<div n="lb"/>vise. (Chapter 22, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The end of Pṛthu.%} After several years of benign
<div n="lb"/>rule Pṛthu became old. He then entrusted the affairs
<div n="lb"/>of the state to his son Vijitāśva and left for penance
<div n="lb"/>with his wife Arccis. After doing severe penance for
<div n="lb"/>a long time he merged with Parabrahman. Arccis who
<div n="lb"/>was all along serving her husband with devotion
<div n="lb"/>ended her life by jumping into the funeral pyre of her
<div n="lb"/>husband following her husband like Lakṣmī following
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Pṛthu's sons.%} Pṛthu had five sons named Vijitāśva,
<div n="lb"/>Haryakṣa, Dhūmrakeśa, Vṛka and Draviṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The eldest of these Vijitāśva, with the help of his
<div n="lb"/>brothers ruled the country. Haryakṣa ruled over the
<div n="lb"/>east, Dhūmrakeśa over the south, Vṛka, west and
<div n="lb"/>Draviṇa, north. (Padma Purāṇa).
