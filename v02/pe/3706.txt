KṚTTIKĀ I¦. When Subrahmaṇya was born the Devas
<div n="lb"/>deputed six mothers to breast-feed him, and they are
<div n="lb"/>called Kṛttikās. Certain Purāṇas hold the view that
<div n="lb"/>six faces were caused to Subrahmaṇya as he had to
<div n="lb"/>feed on six breasts at the same time while others opine
<div n="lb"/>that six mothers were deputed to feed him as he was
<div n="lb"/>born with six faces. Again, according to certain
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas it was Pārvatī, who deputed the Kṛttikās. The
<div n="lb"/>child came to be known as Kārttikeya also as it was fed
<div n="lb"/>by the Kṛttikās. (Skanda Purāṇa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 37 and Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇaka-
<div n="lb"/>lambaka, Taraṅga 6).
<div n="NI"/>After having fed Skanda the Kṛttikās entered into the
<div n="lb"/>sphere of the stars. (Vana Parva, Chapter 236, Verse
<div n="lb"/>11). The star into which the Kṛttikās entered is
<div n="lb"/>called the Kṛttikā star. Nārada said once that if one
<div n="lb"/>feeds brahmins with ghee and pudding on Kārttika day
<div n="lb"/>one may ascend to Devaloka. (Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 64, Verse 5).
