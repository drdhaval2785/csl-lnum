DEVĪ¦. (Mahāmāyā). Though Devī is without a beginn-
<div n="lb"/>ing it is told how she became first visible to living beings.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Beginning:%} While Mahāviṣṇu was resting on a fig
<div n="lb"/>leaf in the assumed form of a child he began thinking
<div n="lb"/>as to who he was, who created him and how he should
<div n="lb"/>act. And then a celestial voice announced as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Sarvaṃ khalvidamevāham
<div n="NI"/>Nānyadasti sanātanam.
<div n="NI"/>(All that is, I am. There is nothing eternal but me.).
<div n="lb"/>This declaration astonished Viṣṇu, but he could not
<div n="lb"/>understand who made it. While he was meditating
<div n="lb"/>upon it, Devī appeared to him in the following manner.
<div n="lb"/>Devī
<F>1) <Poem>Ratir bhūtistathā buddhirmati kīrtiḥ smrtirdhṛtiḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Sraddhā, medhā, svadhā, svāhā Kṣudhā, nidrā, dayā, gatiḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣṭiḥ puṣṭiḥ kṣamā lajjā jṛmbhā tandrā ca śaktayaḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Saṃsthitāḥ sarvataḥ pārśve Mahādevyāḥ pṛthak pṛthak. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Prathama, Skandha).</F> held in her four sacred hands weapons like the
<div n="lb"/>conch, the disc, the club and the lotus flower and was
<div n="lb"/>clad in divine clothes and wore divine ornaments and
<div n="lb"/>was attended upon by powers
<F>1) <Poem>Ratir bhūtistathā buddhirmati kīrtiḥ smrtirdhṛtiḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Sraddhā, medhā, svadhā, svāhā Kṣudhā, nidrā, dayā, gatiḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣṭiḥ puṣṭiḥ kṣamā lajjā jṛmbhā tandrā ca śaktayaḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Saṃsthitāḥ sarvataḥ pārśve Mahādevyāḥ pṛthak pṛthak. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Prathama, Skandha).</F> like Rati (the erotic),
<div n="lb"/>Bhūti (riches and prosperity), Buddhi (intelligence),
<div n="lb"/>Mati (intellect), Kīrti (reputation), Dhṛti (understanding
[Page216-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>capacity), Smṛti (ability to remember), Śraddhā (atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion, concentration), Medhā (intellect), Svadhā, Svāhā,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣudhā (thirst), Nidrā (sleep), Dayā (compassion), Gati,
<div n="lb"/>(momentum), Tuṣṭi (pleasure, happiness) Puṣṭi (growth,
<div n="lb"/>progress), Kṣamā (patience, forbearance), Lajjā (sense
<div n="lb"/>of shame), Jṛmbhā and Tandrā (laziness).
<div n="NI"/>And, the Devī spoke to Mahāviṣṇu as follows:—After
<div n="lb"/>all, what is there to be wondered at. Whenever the
<div n="lb"/>world faced the phenomenon of Sṛṣṭisthitilaya (crea-
<div n="lb"/>tion, existence and absorption into the primordial force)
<div n="lb"/>you too have come up due to the power of Mahāśakti.
<div n="lb"/>As for Parāśakti (the ultimate, universal force) it is
<div n="lb"/>above and beyond all attributes. We, all of us, possess
<div n="lb"/>attributes. From the nābhi (navel) of yourself in whom
<div n="lb"/>sattvaguṇa (gentle attributes) predominates will be
<div n="lb"/>born Brahmā in whom rajoguṇa (active attributes)
<div n="lb"/>will predominate, and from the centre of his brows
<div n="lb"/>will be born Rudra with tamoguṇa (black, destructive
<div n="lb"/>attributes). Brahmā, by the force of his tapas will earn
<div n="lb"/>powers of creation and will with his rajoguṇa create
<div n="lb"/>the world blood-red in colour, and you will be the
<div n="lb"/>sustainer and guardian of that world. The very same
<div n="lb"/>world will be annihilated by Rudra at the end of the
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa era. You please do know that I am the sāttvic
<div n="lb"/>force which depend on you for the purpose of creation.
<div n="lb"/>All creations of worlds have been made according to
<div n="lb"/>the suggestions of Devī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of Devī.%} Once King Janamejaya questioned
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa about the birth of Devī to which he replied as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Even Brahmāviṣṇumaheśvaras (Brahmā, Viṣṇu and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva—the Hindu trinity) are not capable of thinking
<div n="lb"/>about the origin of Devī. Then, what about me? Yet
<div n="lb"/>let me make an attempt. All the forces—everything—
<div n="lb"/>which appear in various names and forms are in fact
<div n="lb"/>Devī herself, her different manifestations. Just as a
<div n="lb"/>master actor appears on the stage in different roles for
<div n="lb"/>the delectation of the audience the formless Devī, on
<div n="lb"/>behalf of the Devas, assumes many forms and imposes
<div n="lb"/>upon herself attributes though in fact she is without any
<div n="lb"/>attribute whatsoever. Thus, depending on her various
<div n="lb"/>forms, actions etc. she is addressed by different names.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Pañcama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Five forms of Devī.%} When primordial nature (Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>prakṛti) incarnated or manifested in the form of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>the desire for creation raised its head in him. And, at
<div n="lb"/>once the Devī—female—aspects in Viṣṇu manifested
<div n="lb"/>in five forms like Durgā, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī, Sāvitrī and
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā. These five forms are designated as the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcadevīs. Brief notes on the five Devīs are given
<div n="lb"/>below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Durgādevī.%} Mother of Gaṇeśa bhagavān. (God with
<div n="lb"/>the elephant's head). She is the consort of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇī, the Viṣṇumāyā, is none else than Durgā.
<div n="lb"/>She is also perfect Brahma, the one and the only one
<div n="lb"/>with no second to it. She is worshipped by Devas like
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and by sages and maharṣis. She is the basis,
<div n="lb"/>the root and root cause of everything. She is eternal,
<div n="lb"/>upholder of dharma, truth itself and the giver and
<div n="lb"/>promoter of happiness, reputation, welfare, salvation
<div n="lb"/>etc. as also of sorrow, grief, pain etc. She takes great
[Page217-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>pleasure in removing the worries and sorrows of devo-
<div n="lb"/>tees who seek refuge in her. She is all-power, achieve-
<div n="lb"/>ments and assets personified. All imaginable permuta-
<div n="lb"/>tions and combinations of every attribute comprise in
<div n="lb"/>her and she it is who activates the universal soul.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Lakṣmī.%} This Devī is the most sublime form of the
<div n="lb"/>universal soul, nay, the universal soul itself. She is all
<div n="lb"/>wealth and riches personified, and she is the very seat of
<div n="lb"/>beauty, compassion, welfare, peace, all goodness etc.
<div n="lb"/>Evil traits like anger, avarice, haughtiness etc. are miles
<div n="lb"/>away from her. She is all sympathy and kindness
<div n="lb"/>towards her devotees. In Vaikuṇṭha, as Mahālakṣmī she
<div n="lb"/>is ever engaged in the service of her husband, Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>In heaven she is the very glory of it. In houses she
<div n="lb"/>appears as the welfare and prosperity of the inmates.
<div n="lb"/>She is in fact beauty itself and is the essence of beauty
<div n="lb"/>everywhere. She is all-merciful, and worshipped by
<div n="lb"/>all.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Sarasvatī.%} She is very base and fountain head of and
<div n="lb"/>the presiding deity of the word, intellect, knowledge,
<div n="lb"/>the arts etc. She also is of the form of the universal
<div n="lb"/>soul and liberally grants intellect, poetical skill, reason
<div n="lb"/>and logic, understanding capacity etc. to her devotees.
<div n="lb"/>The finest music with all its beauties originates from
<div n="lb"/>her. Yes, she is the goddess of all learning, fine arts and
<div n="lb"/>every branch of knowledge. Like the ice piece, the
<div n="lb"/>Jasmine flower etc. she is beautiful in her white cover.
<div n="lb"/>She recited the holy names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. She is of the
<div n="lb"/>form of tapas and blesses those who perform it. In fact,
<div n="lb"/>she it is who grants all gifts and powers of understand-
<div n="lb"/>ing. She is the goddess of language and learning (Vāṇī-
<div n="lb"/>mātā) and without her human beings would lose their
<div n="lb"/>capacity to speak.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Sāvitrīdevī.%} She is mother of the four varṇas (castes,
<div n="lb"/>classes) Vedāṅgas, the tāntric science etc. She is of
<div n="lb"/>the form of Japa (chanting of holy names and mantras),
<div n="lb"/>tapas, the effulgence of Brahman, the very essence of
<div n="lb"/>truth and existence and supreme bliss. She is eternal
<div n="lb"/>and grants salvation. She forms the very basis and pith
<div n="lb"/>and core of the glowing presence of the universal soul.
<div n="lb"/>This world is pure, and has been purified by the touch
<div n="lb"/>of the sacred feet of this Devī.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Rādhādevī.%} Rādhikādevī, fifth of the pañcaprakṛtis is
<div n="lb"/>the presiding deity over the five prāṇas and She is of
<div n="lb"/>the form of those prāṇas. She is exceptionally beautiful
<div n="lb"/>endowed with all fortunes and happiness, sublime and
<div n="lb"/>serious, and the consort of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and as eternal
<div n="lb"/>and equally endowed with divine attributes as the lord.
<div n="lb"/>She is formless also, above and beyond attributes,
<div n="lb"/>unattached and detached, and not visible even to the
<div n="lb"/>great Devas and munis by the naked eye. Her clothes
<div n="lb"/>even Agni would not burn. She was born, in Vārāha
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa as the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, and because her
<div n="lb"/>sacred feet trod over this land, Bhārata (India) became
<div n="lb"/>holy. Once Brahmā did tapas for 60,000 years to have
<div n="lb"/>a glimpse of the Devī's lotus feet, but could not. People
<div n="lb"/>were able to see her only after she, in unbounded com-
<div n="lb"/>passion for the world, incarnated herself in Vṛndāvana
<div n="lb"/>(See Prakṛti).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Aṃśarūpa(s)—partial manifestations of Devī.%} The
<div n="lb"/>above discussion was concerned with the five forms of the
<div n="lb"/>Devī in her full and complete forms. Now, there are
<div n="lb"/>six other Devīs, who are partial manifestations or born
<div n="lb"/>from certain parts of the Devī.
[Page217-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Gaṅgādevī.%} This Devī who flows in the form of
<div n="lb"/>water and washes off men's sins takes her origin from
<div n="lb"/>the body of Mahāviṣṇu. (There is another story which
<div n="lb"/>traces Gaṅgā's origin to the Aṇḍa (egg or seed) of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā). (See Gaṅgā).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Tulasī.%} She is the lover and also the servant at
<div n="lb"/>the feet of Viṣṇu. She also washes off men's sins and
<div n="lb"/>promotes their welfare. (See Tulasī).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Manasādevī%} Manasādevī, who was born as a dau-
<div n="lb"/>ghter of Kaśyapa is another partial incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmāyā. She is a great tapasvinī, a favourite dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciple of Śaṅkara, unique in learning and erudition,
<div n="lb"/>sister of Ananta (the king of Serpents), the presiding
<div n="lb"/>deity of Mantras, wife of Jaratkāru muni and mother
<div n="lb"/>of Āstīka muni. (See Manasādevī).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Devasenādevī.%} Since this Devī has been born out of a
<div n="lb"/>sixth part of Mahāmāyā she is called Ṣaṣṭhīdevī also. It
<div n="lb"/>is this Devī, who gives children to living beings and also
<div n="lb"/>protects them. For one year from the birth of a child
<div n="lb"/>this Devī should be worshipped. Those who cannot
<div n="lb"/>afford it should worship Devī on the 6th or 21st day
<div n="lb"/>after a child is born. (See Devasenā).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Maṅgalacaṇḍikā.%} She is born from the face of
<div n="lb"/>Mūlaprakṛti. Anybody who propitiates and pleases
<div n="lb"/>her will be the recipient of all good things like sons and
<div n="lb"/>grandsons, wealth, reputation, welfare etc. (See Maṅ-
<div n="lb"/>galacaṇḍikā).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Bhūmidevī.%} She is the basis for all things, soil for
<div n="lb"/>the origin of the vegetable kingdom, the treasure
<div n="lb"/>house of all gems and the very incarnation of compas-
<div n="lb"/>sion and sympathy. (See Bhūmidevī).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Aṃśakalādevī(s).%} Another class of devīs who are
<div n="lb"/>also partial manifestations of the Supreme Devī. They
<div n="lb"/>are born out of the parts of Mahādevī. The following
<div n="lb"/>are the Aṃśakalādevīs.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Svāhādevī.%} Consort of Agni Bhagavān (Fire God).
<div n="lb"/>Svāhā is worshipped in all the worlds. If havis (obla-
<div n="lb"/>tion) is offered without repeating her name the Devas
<div n="lb"/>will not accept it.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Dakṣiṇādevī.%} Wife of Yajñadeva, this Devī is wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped by all. Without this Devī all Karmans (actions)
<div n="lb"/>in the world will become futile.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Dīkṣādevī.%} Wife of Yajñadeva, this Devī is worshipp-
<div n="lb"/>ed by all.
<Poem>Dīyate vimalaṃ jñānam
<div n="lb"/>Kṣīyate karmavāsanā /
<div n="lb"/>Tena dīkṣeti sā proktā.</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>The Devī grants pure knowledge.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Svadhādevī.%} Wife of the Pitṛs, worshipped by manes
<div n="lb"/>and men. Offerings made to the Pitṛs without honour-
<div n="lb"/>ing this Devī will prove to be futile.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Svastidevī.%} Consort of the Vāyu. When offering Dakṣiṇā
<div n="lb"/>and making divya-dāna (divine gifts) if ‘Svasti’ (may
<div n="lb"/>good happen) is not uttered the gifts will be of no use.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Puṣṭidevī.%} Wife of Gaṇapati. If this Devī ceased to
<div n="lb"/>exist men and women would become feeble, because
<div n="lb"/>she is the source of all strength.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Tuṣṭidevī.%} Consort of Ananta worshipped by every-
<div n="lb"/>body. If the Devī ceased to exist there would be no
<div n="lb"/>happiness in the world.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Sampatti devī.%} Wife of Īśāna. Worshipped by Devas
<div n="lb"/>and men. If the Devī ceased to exist the whole world
<div n="lb"/>would become poor and indigent.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Dhṛti.%} Consort of Kapila. Everybody worships her
[Page218-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>all the time. If the Devī ceased to exist the whole world
<div n="lb"/>would become timid and cowardly.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Satīdevī.%} Wife of Satya. Well-wisher of all, this
<div n="lb"/>Devī is worshipped by muktas. (people released from
<div n="lb"/>worldly attachments). If the Devī ceased to exist there
<div n="lb"/>would be no friendship and amity between people.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Dayādevī.%} Wife of Moha. If the Devī ceased to
<div n="lb"/>exist the world would become hellish and a fierce battle
<div n="lb"/>field.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Pratiṣṭhādevī.%} Wife of Puṇya. In the absence of
<div n="lb"/>this Devī, who grants good and happy results to people's
<div n="lb"/>actions the whole world would become as though it
<div n="lb"/>were dead.
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Siddhadevī.%}
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Kīrtidevī.%} Both the Devīs, Siddhā and Kīrti are
<div n="lb"/>wives of Sukarmā. If they ceased to exist the whole
<div n="lb"/>world would be bereft of reputation and become lifeless
<div n="lb"/>like a dead body.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Kriyādevī.%} Wife of Udyoga. If she ceased to exist
<div n="lb"/>the whole world would become inactive and cease to
<div n="lb"/>function.
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Mithyāḍevī.%} Wife of Adharma. Wayward and
<div n="lb"/>characterless people worship this Devī. If the Devī
<div n="lb"/>ceased to exist the whole world as evolved by Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>would cease to exist. This Devī was not seen anywhere
<div n="lb"/>in the world during Kṛtayuga. She began to appear
<div n="lb"/>in a subtle form here and there during Tretāyuga. In
<div n="lb"/>dvāparayuga she attained more growth and then her
<div n="lb"/>limbs and organs became doubly strong. In Kaliyuga
<div n="lb"/>she developed to her full stature and growth and goes
<div n="lb"/>about everywhere with her brother, Cheat (Kapaṭa).
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Śāntidevī.%} (see below).
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Lajjādevī.%} Both the Devīs, Śānti and Lajjā are good-
<div n="lb"/>natured wives. If they ceased to exist the world would
<div n="lb"/>become dull and sleepy.
<div n="NI"/>(19-20-21) {%Buddhidevī, Medhādevī%} and {%Dhṛtidevī.%} These
<div n="lb"/>three Devīs are wives of Jñāna. If they ceased to exist
<div n="lb"/>the world would become steeped in ignorance and
<div n="lb"/>foolishness.
<div n="NI"/>(22) {%Mūrti.%} Wife of Dharma. She is very beautiful and
<div n="lb"/>effulgent. In her absence the universal soul would be-
<div n="lb"/>come devoid of vitality, helpless and meaningless.
<div n="NI"/>(23) {%Śrīdevī.%} Wife of Mālī. Her absence will make the
<div n="lb"/>world lifeless.
<div n="NI"/>(24) {%Nidrādevī.%} Wife of Kālāgni. The Devī, a sage
<div n="lb"/>who has attained realisation, affects everybody in the
<div n="lb"/>world during night and makes them lose consciousness
<div n="lb"/>and plunges them in sleep. In the absence of this Devī
<div n="lb"/>the world will become a lunatic asylum.
<div n="NI"/>(25-26-27) {%Rātrī, Sandhyā%} and {%Divasā.%} These three are the
<div n="lb"/>wives of Time (Kāla). In their absence nobody would
<div n="lb"/>have any sense of time and none would be able to cal-
<div n="lb"/>culate and fix time.
<div n="NI"/>(28-29) {%Viśappu%} and {%Dāham.%} Viśappu = hunger.
<div n="lb"/>Dāham = thirst. These two Devīs are the wives of
<div n="lb"/>greed (Lobha). They go about the world affecting
<div n="lb"/>people and thus making them worried and miserable.
<div n="NI"/>(30-31) {%Prabhādevī%} and {%Dāhikā devī%} are the wives of
<div n="lb"/>Tejas (Vitality). Without them Īśvara will find it im-
<div n="lb"/>possible to continue the function of creation.
<div n="NI"/>(32-33) {%Mṛtyu%} and {%Jarā%} are the consorts of Prakṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>jvara and daughters of Kāla. And, if they cease to exist,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's creation would also cease. (For Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>creation individual souls with the will for action are
[Page218-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>necessary. He cannot create a soul of his own. So
<div n="lb"/>death is a pre-condition of creation, birth. If there is
<div n="lb"/>no death there is no birth also. There is a school of
<div n="lb"/>thought which maintains that if there is no death but
<div n="lb"/>only birth there will not be space on earth for the living,
<div n="lb"/>and therefore birth will stop if there is no death.).
<div n="NI"/>(34-35) {%Tandrā%} and {%Prīti%} are the daughters of Nidrā and
<div n="lb"/>consorts of Sukha (pleasure, happiness). These Devīs go
<div n="lb"/>around the world on the orders of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(36-37) {%Śraddhā%} and {%Bhakti%} are the consorts of Vairāgya
<div n="lb"/>(aversion to wordly comforts, renunciation) and they
<div n="lb"/>give salvation to the souls of the people in the world.
<div n="NI"/>Aditi, mother of the Devas, Diti, mother of the Asuras,
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi, mother of cows, Kadrū, mother of serpents
<div n="lb"/>and Vinatā, mother of Garuḍas are also involved in the
<div n="lb"/>process of creation, and they are born out of parts of
<div n="lb"/>Devī.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Idol of Devī.%} There are special injunctions for mak-
<div n="lb"/>ing idols of the Devī for installation in temples. Caṇḍi-
<div n="lb"/>kādevī should have twenty hands. The hands on the
<div n="lb"/>right side should hold Śūla, sword, disc, cord,
<div n="lb"/>ḍamaru, śakti etc. and the hands on the left side should
<div n="lb"/>hold nāgapāśa, flag, club, mirror etc. (There are also
<div n="lb"/>idols with slight differences from the above).
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmīdevī would hold in her right hand the lotus
<div n="lb"/>flower and a Kūvala fruit in the left. Sarasvatīdevī will
<div n="lb"/>have in her hands books, akṣamālā and vīṇā. Gaṅgādevī
<div n="lb"/>rides on a makaramatsya (fish) holding in her hands
<div n="lb"/>a pot and lotus flowers. Yamunādevī rides the turtle
<div n="lb"/>with a pot in hand and she is blue in colour.
<div n="NI"/>Now, about the saptamātṛs. Tumburu, white in colour,
<div n="lb"/>and mounted on an ox rests on a śūla with vīṇā in hand
<div n="lb"/>before the Mātṛs. Among the Mātṛs Brāhmī has four
<div n="lb"/>faces, wears the akṣamālā and holds the akṣapātra etc.
<div n="lb"/>in her left hand. She is seated on a swan. Śāṅkarī
<div n="lb"/>(Māheśvarī) is white in colour. She has in her right
<div n="lb"/>hand bow and arrows, and the disc and bow in her left
<div n="lb"/>hand. The ox is her vehicle. Kaumārī is seated on the
<div n="lb"/>peacock. She has two hands in one of which is held
<div n="lb"/>Śakti (Vel). Lakṣmī has in her right hand the conch
<div n="lb"/>and disc, and the club and the lotus flower in her left
<div n="lb"/>hand. Vārāhī rides the buffalo with staff, sword, club
<div n="lb"/>and conch in her hands. Indrāṇī is seated on the club,
<div n="lb"/>holding diamond in her hands. She has a thousand
<div n="lb"/>eyes. Cāmuṇḍī has three eyes and is without flesh in the
<div n="lb"/>body. Her hairs are raised above. She holds in her left
<div n="lb"/>hand elephant's skin and śūla in the right hand. At
<div n="lb"/>times she is seated on a corpse also.
<div n="NI"/>Now, about the idols of the eight Aṃbās. Rudra Carc-
<div n="lb"/>cikā holds a skull, Śūla and cord in her hands. She
<div n="lb"/>wears elephant's skin, her legs slightly held up. She
<div n="lb"/>becomes Rudracāmuṇḍā when she assumes eight hands,
<div n="lb"/>and holds the skull and the ḍamaru. And in dancing
<div n="lb"/>pose she is called Naṭeśvarī, and with four faces Mahāl-
<div n="lb"/>akṣmī. She is called Siddhacāmuṇḍā when she assumes
<div n="lb"/>the form with ten hands and three eyes, and when she
<div n="lb"/>eats men, horses and buffaloes. In this form she holds
<div n="lb"/>in her right hand the sword, ḍamaru etc. and in her
<div n="lb"/>left hand the Triśūla, bell etc. Since the Devī is sarva-
<div n="lb"/>siddhipradāyikā (giver of all divine attainments or
<div n="lb"/>assets) she is Siddhayogeśvarī also. There is also an-
<div n="lb"/>other Devī in this very form who holds the pāśa and
<div n="lb"/>Aṃkuśa in her hand and who is slightly red in colour.
<div n="lb"/>She is called Bhairavī. When Bhairavī assumes the
<div n="lb"/>form with twelve hands she is called Rūpavidyā. All the
[Page219-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>above eight Devīs were born in burial grounds and are
<div n="lb"/>Raudramūrtis. They are known as the Aṣṭāmbās.
