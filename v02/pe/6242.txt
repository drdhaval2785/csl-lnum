SAPTACARU¦. A holy place. The reason for giving this
<div n="lb"/>place the name Saptacaru is given in Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 82 as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The word ‘Caru’ means sacrifice. Once devas (gods)
<div n="lb"/>and men together put the fat parts of sacrificial animals,
<div n="lb"/>as burnt offerings in the sacrificial fire, each singing
<div n="lb"/>seven verses from the Ṛgveda. By this sacrifice they
<div n="lb"/>obtained more prosperity than the fruits of giving one
<div n="lb"/>lakh of cows as alms or performing hundred Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices or thousand horse-sacrifices.
<div n="NI"/>“The wise said that it was an endless gift to the
<div n="lb"/>manes. The gods, the manes, the Gandharvas, the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maids, the gaṇas, the yakṣas, Kinnaras, the
<div n="lb"/>siddhas, the Vidyādharas, the people of the earth, the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas, the daityas, the Rudras, Brahmā, all these
<div n="lb"/>joined together with vow and fast taken for a thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand years and performed a sacrifice each exalting
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu by singing seven verses from Ṛgveda. Keśava
<div n="lb"/>was much pleased at the caru and gave them Āṣtaiś-
<div n="lb"/>varyasiddhi (the eight miraculous attainments) and
<div n="lb"/>everything they wished. Thus giving them all kinds of
<div n="lb"/>prosperities, the god Mukunda disappeared in this place
<div n="lb"/>as lightning in the clouds. Therefore this place became
<div n="lb"/>famous everywhere by the name Saptacaru.”
