ĀDITYA¦. The twelve sons born to the sage Kaśyapa of
<div n="lb"/>his wife Aditi are known as the twelve Ādityas. They
<div n="lb"/>are the following: Dhātā, Mitra, Aryamā, Rudra,
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, Sūrya, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā, Savitā, Tvaṣṭā
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣṇu. Besides these Aditi had twentyone children
<div n="lb"/>including Indra. All of them are called Ādityas mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing children of Aditi. From the thirtythree sons of Aditi
<div n="lb"/>were born the thirtythree crores of devatās. Of these
<div n="lb"/>the eldest is Indra and the youngest, Vāmana. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>36, Chapter 66, Ādi Parva, M.B.). (There is corrobora-
<div n="lb"/>tion for this in Śloka 14, Sarga 14, Araṇya Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Sirdar K.M. Panikar in his preface to the book “Ṛgveda-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā” writes thus about Ādityas: “Generally we
<div n="lb"/>think of Sūrya (the Sun) when we hear the word
<div n="lb"/>Āditya. But there are many different Ādityas in Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda, chief of them is Varuṇa. Though Savitā, Pūṣā
[Page086-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and Mitra are all synonyms of Sūrya in Ṛgveda they
<div n="lb"/>are all separate devas. There is no end to the varieties
<div n="lb"/>of Ādityas and their prominence in the Vedas. Sum-
<div n="lb"/>marising we can say thus. The familiar devas like
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Agni, Varuṇa and Sūrya are not found in the
<div n="lb"/>same form or power as we are taught to believe. Those
<div n="lb"/>whom we have lowered down to the posts of the eight
<div n="lb"/>sentries of the universe are very prominent devatās in
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas. Many Ādityas have merged in Sūrya and
<div n="lb"/>winds in the god of Vāyu. Rudra has merged in Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Who will believe that the all-powerful Deva of the Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda and the vainglorious Indra who lives in fear of
<div n="lb"/>men doing penance are one and the same person?”
