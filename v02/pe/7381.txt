SVĀHĀDEVI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Wife of god Agni (fire). There
<div n="lb"/>is a story about the birth of this goddess, as given below,
<div n="lb"/>in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning of creation sufficient arrangements
<div n="lb"/>had not been made for food to be supplied to the
<div n="lb"/>Devas (gods). They were in misery. At last the devas
<div n="lb"/>reached Satyaloka and requested Brahmā to make some
<div n="lb"/>arrangements for their food. Brahmā pacified them by
<div n="lb"/>saying that he would make available to them, the
<div n="lb"/>‘havis’ offered by Brahmins as food. Then Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>meditated on the Mūla-Prakṛti. A particle of Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>Prakṛti appeared before Brahmā and asked him what
<div n="lb"/>boon he required. Brahmā said thus:—Oh Goddess!
<div n="lb"/>The gods are miserable due to lack of food. The fire
<div n="lb"/>is not powerful enough to digest the ‘havis’ offered by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins in the fire so as to convert them as food for
<div n="lb"/>the gods. The fire would become powerful to digest the
<div n="lb"/>havis only if your esteemed self would reside in fire as
<div n="lb"/>the power of digestion. Only the havis offered, with the
<div n="lb"/>mantra, (spell) ending with the holy name of your
<div n="lb"/>glorious self could be digested by fire and taken to the
<div n="lb"/>gods as food, and they could accept it as food. So it is
<div n="lb"/>my request that your gracious self would become the
<div n="lb"/>power that dwells in fire as the figure of wealth and
<div n="lb"/>prosperity, adored by men and gods.”
<div n="NI"/>But that goddess said that her desire was to get
[Page777-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa as her husband. She did penance to Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, who appeared and said: “Devī! you will take
<div n="lb"/>birth as the daughter of King Nagnajit in Varāha
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa (a world-age) and then you will become my
<div n="lb"/>wife. Now you have to become the wife of Agni under
<div n="lb"/>the name Svāhādevī and become the power of digestion,
<div n="lb"/>and part of the spell (mantra). You and Agni will be
<div n="lb"/>worshipped together by all. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Svāhādevī became the wife of Fire. It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10, that three sons
<div n="lb"/>Pāvaka, Pavamāna and Śuci, were born to the couple.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Devī).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 11, Verse 42, that Svāhādevī remains in the
<div n="lb"/>court of Brahmā, glorifying him.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once Svāhādevī appeared among the wives of
<div n="lb"/>hermits. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 225, Verse 7).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) When Subrahmaṇya was anointed as captain of
<div n="lb"/>the army, Svāhādevī also was present. (Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 13).
