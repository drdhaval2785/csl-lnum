DRUPADA¦. (Saumaki,
<F>1. Mahāb hārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 68 states that the original name of Drupada was Yajñasena. Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 129, Stanza 41, states that Drupada was the son of Pṛṣata. But according to other purānas Pṛṣata was the
<div n="lb"/>father of Drupada's great grandfather. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 131, Stanza 6, Drupada is addressed as ‘Saumaki;
<div n="lb"/>the son of Somaka.</F> Yajñasena). Father of Pāñcālī.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Education and kingship.%} Yajñasena went to the hermi-
<div n="lb"/>tage of Bharadvāja for education. Droṇa, who became
<div n="lb"/>a great teacher in archery later, was also a student and
<div n="lb"/>disciple of Bharadvāja at that time. Thus during the
<div n="lb"/>time of education both Drupada and Droṇa became
<div n="lb"/>fast friends. After receiving education Drupada re-
<div n="lb"/>turned to his country. At that time Pāñcāla was ruled
<div n="lb"/>by Pṛṣata. When Yajñasena returned on completion of
<div n="lb"/>his education, Pṛṣata died and Yajñasena was anointed
<div n="lb"/>as King of Uttara-Pāñcāla. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 129).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yajñasena reproaches Droṇa.%} It has already been said
<div n="lb"/>that during the period of education Droṇa and Yajña-
<div n="lb"/>sena were fast friends. Once Drupada said to Droṇa:
<div n="lb"/>“My dear friend. My father has told me that I would
<div n="lb"/>be made the King of Uttara Pāñcāla on completing my
<div n="lb"/>education. Thus if I become a King, the treasury of the
<div n="lb"/>King will be at your disposal.”
<div n="NI"/>After the education both returned to their places. Not
<div n="lb"/>much later Droṇa got married. A son born to him was
<div n="lb"/>named Aśvatthāmā. Droṇa was so poor that he could
<div n="lb"/>not even buy milk for his child. Once the friends of
<div n="lb"/>Aśvatthāmā mixed flour in water and made him drink
<div n="lb"/>it saying that it was milk. Aśvatthāmā drank it without
<div n="lb"/>knowing that it was not milk. Thinking that he had
<div n="lb"/>become energetic by drinking milk he began to run
<div n="lb"/>with the other boys. At last they told him the truth
<div n="lb"/>and teased him.
<div n="NI"/>With his wife and child Droṇa went to Drupada who
<div n="lb"/>did not care to recognize him as a friend. Droṇa tried
<div n="lb"/>to remind him of their former friendship. But Drupada
<div n="lb"/>shunned him and said, “If I had friendship with you,
<div n="lb"/>it was to achieve certain ends. There is no friendship
<div n="lb"/>between the rich and the poor, the learned and the
<div n="lb"/>illiterate, the brave and the coward. So if there was
<div n="lb"/>any friendship at all it was not real. You, who are slow
<div n="lb"/>of brain! Kings of high status cannot have friendship
<div n="lb"/>with such people especially the poor. A Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>learned in Vedas won't befriend a Brahmin who is not
<div n="lb"/>learned in Vedas, a man seated in a chariot cannot
<div n="lb"/>befriend a man who is not seated in a chariot and a
<div n="lb"/>King cannot befriend one who is not a King. So a
<div n="lb"/>friendship of bygone days is no friendship at all”.
<div n="NI"/>Drupada's reproaches aroused a storm of anger in
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa. He vowed that he would avenge the insult.
<div n="lb"/>With his wife and child he got out of the palace. He
[Page252-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>wandered about in search of disciples who were capable
<div n="lb"/>of confronting with Drupada. At last he came to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura and became the teacher of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kauravas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 130).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The revenge of Droṇa.%} Droṇa told Bhīṣma about his
<div n="lb"/>dealings with Drupada. Bhīṣma consoled Droṇa. Before
<div n="lb"/>the commencement of the training in archery, Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>told his disciples: “When your training in archery is
<div n="lb"/>completed you will have to do a favour to your tea-
<div n="lb"/>cher”. All stood agape. But Arjuna came forward and
<div n="lb"/>said: “I will do”. Droṇa embraced Arjuna. The train-
<div n="lb"/>ing commenced. The Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and others
<div n="lb"/>joined his school of archery.
<div n="NI"/>The training in archery came to an end. Droṇa called
<div n="lb"/>his disciples and told them that Drupada should be
<div n="lb"/>tied with a rope and placed before him. When they
<div n="lb"/>heard the words of the teacher, Duryodhana, Karṇa, Yu-
<div n="lb"/>yutsu, Duśśāsana, Vikarṇa, Jarāsandha and Sulocana led
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas to Pāñcāla. Arjuna knew that the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas would not be able to defeat Drupada. He
<div n="lb"/>told the teacher that when the Kauravas returned
<div n="lb"/>without achieving the task, he himself would go and
<div n="lb"/>bring Drupada. After a terrible battle the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>were defeated by the Pāñcālas. After that Arjuna con-
<div n="lb"/>fronted Drupada. Nakula and Sahadeva stood as
<div n="lb"/>guards of the wheels. Bhīmasena with his club stood
<div n="lb"/>in front of the army. Arjuna drove the chariot right
<div n="lb"/>in the midst of the Pāñcāla army. Bhīma took his club
<div n="lb"/>and a terrible battle ensued. Arjuna shattered the
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla army, bound Drupada and took him to Droṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The teacher looked at Drupada and reproached him
<div n="lb"/>with scornful word: “I have destroyed your country.
<div n="lb"/>Now you are at my mercy. Is not the former friendship
<div n="lb"/>a friendship?” Drupada requested that they should be
<div n="lb"/>friends in future. Accordingly Drupada was set free.
<div n="lb"/>The country of Pāñcāla was divided into two, and
<div n="lb"/>giving Uttara Pāñcāla to Drupada, Droṇa took Dakṣiṇa
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla. Thus because of the revenge of Droṇa, Dru-
<div n="lb"/>pada lost half of his kingdom. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 137).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Birth of Children.%} Though Droṇa and Drupada
<div n="lb"/>were on friendly terms Drupada did not forget the
<div n="lb"/>defeat he had incurred at the hands of Droṇa. So,
<div n="lb"/>Drupada desired to have a son who would become
<div n="lb"/>powerful enough to take revenge on Droṇa. He began
<div n="lb"/>to think of ways and means. He consulted several
<div n="lb"/>learned Brahmins. At that time two hermit brothers
<div n="lb"/>yāja and Upayāja lived on the bank of the Ganges.
<div n="lb"/>The King approached them and requested their help to
<div n="lb"/>obtain a son, who would kill Droṇa, and promised to
<div n="lb"/>give them cows and other precious things in return.
<div n="lb"/>At first they refused to help him. The King served
<div n="lb"/>Upayāja for a year, and pleased him. He sent the King
<div n="lb"/>to the hermitage of Yāja. They accepted the request
<div n="lb"/>of the King. Both the hermits performed a sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>for Drupada. A boy and a girl arose from the sacrifi-
<div n="lb"/>cial fire. The boy was named Dhṛṣṭadyumna and the
<div n="lb"/>girl was named Kṛṣṇā (Pāñcālī). There was a celes-
<div n="lb"/>tial voice that the boy would kill Droṇa when he grew
<div n="lb"/>up. (M.B. Ādi parva, Chapter 167).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The marriage of Pāñcālī.%} Pāñcālī grew up. Drupada
<div n="lb"/>desired to give her in marriage to Arjuna. But at that
<div n="lb"/>time the lac-house caught fire and the Pāṇḍavas disap-
<div n="lb"/>peared. Drupada set certain tests in the Svayaṃvara
<div n="lb"/>of Pāñcālī with a view to ascertain if Arjuna was alive.
[Page252-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas came to the svayaṃvara and Drupada
<div n="lb"/>found out Arjuna. But Drupada did not like the idea
<div n="lb"/>of his daughter becoming the wife of more than one
<div n="lb"/>husband. Then Vyāsa appeared there and informed
<div n="lb"/>Drupada of the previous births of the Pāṇḍavas and
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī. Drupada was much pleased and he gave the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas a good deal of wealth and sent Pāñcālī with
<div n="lb"/>them. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 196).
