BUDDHA¦. The founder of Buddhism. Some consider
<div n="lb"/>him to be an incarnation of Viṣṇu. In days of old in
<div n="lb"/>a battle the devas were defeated by the asuras and the
<div n="lb"/>gods approached Viṣṇu with their grievance. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu incarnated as the son of Śuddhodana with the
[Page165-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>name Gautamabuddha (Siddhārtha). Then he went
<div n="lb"/>to the asuras and made them reject the Vedas and the
<div n="lb"/>laws thereof. All the Daityas (Asuras) became Bud-
<div n="lb"/>dhists. There is a story in Agnipurāṇa, Chapter 16,
<div n="lb"/>that thus it was the purpose of Buddha to convert
<div n="lb"/>every asura to Buddhism and send him to hell.
<div n="NI"/>The story given above is in accordance with the Purā-
<div n="lb"/>ṇas. The following are the facts gained by historic
<div n="lb"/>investigations.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama Buddha was born in B.C. 560, in Kapilavastu
<div n="lb"/>near the Himālayas. His father was Śuddhodana. He
<div n="lb"/>was born in the family of the Śākyas. The word ‘Śākya’
<div n="lb"/>is another form of the word Kṣatriya. The real name of
<div n="lb"/>Buddha was Siddhārtha. Śuddhodana brought up his
<div n="lb"/>son in such a way that he should not be subjected to
<div n="lb"/>any sort of mental pain or worry. So he kept Buddha
<div n="lb"/>aloof from the outer world. Thus he spent his childhood
<div n="lb"/>in comfort and pleasure. Once by chance he happened
<div n="lb"/>to see a sick man, an old man and a dead body. The
<div n="lb"/>sight made him thoughtful. He began to think upon
<div n="lb"/>a way to remove sorrow and pain from the world and
<div n="lb"/>to bring about peace and comfort.
<div n="NI"/>The change that appeared in the son worried the
<div n="lb"/>father. So at the age of sixteen he made Siddhārtha
<div n="lb"/>marry Yaśodharā. A son was born to them. But the
<div n="lb"/>mind of Siddhārtha was restless, distressed and agi-
<div n="lb"/>tated. One day Siddhārtha discarded everything and
<div n="lb"/>went out of the palace alone.
<div n="NI"/>Siddhārtha wandered from place to place learning
<div n="lb"/>from various teachers. But he did not find peace.
<div n="lb"/>Once on a full-moon day while he was sitting in medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation under a banian tree he got ‘Bodha’. (insight or
<div n="lb"/>conviction). From that day onwards he began to be
<div n="lb"/>known by the name ‘Buddha’. After that he came to
<div n="lb"/>Kāśi, and told his disciples how he got Bodha or con-
<div n="lb"/>viction. The number of his followers increased day by
<div n="lb"/>day. Thus Buddhism came into being. Buddha said
<div n="lb"/>that the reason for pain and sorrow in the world was
<div n="lb"/>desire and that sorrow could be exterminated only
<div n="lb"/>by controlling and overcoming all desire. To attain
<div n="lb"/>Eternal Bliss one should be true and righteous in
<div n="lb"/>thought, deed and word and that ‘Not Killing’ was
<div n="lb"/>the foundation of righteousness. Buddhism spread
<div n="lb"/>everywhere in Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama Buddha died at the age of eighty.
