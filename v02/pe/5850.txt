<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} Ruru happened to see the exceedingly
<div n="lb"/>beautiful Pramadvarā the daughter of Viśvāvasu by
<div n="lb"/>Menakā. The moment he saw her he fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>her. The father of Pramadvarā came to know of this
<div n="lb"/>and he decided to give her in marriage to Ruru.
<div n="lb"/>Preparations for the marriage were being made. One
<div n="lb"/>day during that time Pramadvarā who had been run-
<div n="lb"/>ning here and there joyfully, was bitten by a snake
<div n="lb"/>and she fell down dead. Ruru instantly reached the
<div n="lb"/>spot.
<div n="NI"/>Ruru who was greatly sad and disappointed, got down
<div n="lb"/>to the Ganges and bathed. Then rinsing his mouth
<div n="lb"/>he took some water in his hand and said “By the
<div n="lb"/>favour of God I have acquired by my devotion and
<div n="lb"/>worship of gods, devotion and service to my teacher,
<div n="lb"/>by my scripture-study, my worship with Gāyatrī, my
<div n="lb"/>prayer, and meditation, my penance, my offerings to
<div n="lb"/>the holy fire, and my oblations, let her come to life.
<div n="lb"/>If she does not come to life, I will die in this Ganges
<div n="lb"/>water.” Making this prayer, making the gods witnesses
<div n="lb"/>he poured the water down.
<div n="NI"/>Immediately a messenger from heaven appeared in the
<div n="lb"/>sky and said that she would come to life again provided
<div n="lb"/>Ruru was prepared to give half of his life to her. Ruru
<div n="lb"/>agreed to it. Thus Pramadvarā came to life again and
<div n="lb"/>Ruru married her. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Hatred towards Serpents.%} A relentless hatred grew up
<div n="lb"/>in the heart of Ruru against serpents, because a serpent
<div n="lb"/>had killed his wife. He wandered about destroying
<div n="lb"/>every serpent he come across. Finally when he confronted
<div n="lb"/>Ḍuṇḍubha he was given exhortations and good advices
<div n="lb"/>regarding righteousness by Ḍuṇḍubhla. (M.B. Ādi Parva
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 9, Stanza 19). Moreover it is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 12, that Ruru had
<div n="lb"/>taken a lively interest in the sacrifice of Janamejaya
<div n="lb"/>meant for the extermination of serpents.
