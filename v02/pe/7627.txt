TUMBURU I¦. A Deva Gandharva. He was the best
<div n="lb"/>musician among the Gandharvas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Tumburu was the son of Kaśyapa, son of
<div n="lb"/>Marīci and grandson of Brahmā, born of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Pradhā. Of the sons of Kaśyapa the four Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>sons, Tumburu, Bāhu, Hāhā and Hūhū were noted for
<div n="lb"/>their sweet and pleasant conversation.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Tumburu and the Pāṇḍavas.%} Mahābhārata states
<div n="lb"/>about several occasions when Tumburu has shown a
<div n="lb"/>special and deep interest in the Pāṇḍavas. The follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing few are of special mention—
<div n="NI"/>(i) Tumburu attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 54, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once this Gandharva gave Yudhiṣṭhira a hundred
<div n="lb"/>horses. (Śloka 24, Chapter 52, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Tumburu welcomed Arjuna when the latter went
<div n="lb"/>to Devaloka at the invitation of Indra. (Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 43, Verse 14).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once when the Pāṇḍavas were living incognito in
<div n="lb"/>the country of Virāṭa the Kauravas carried away the
<div n="lb"/>cattle of the King. Arjuna in disguise then fought
<div n="lb"/>against the Kauravas and Tumburu watched the fight
<div n="lb"/>with interest. (Śloka 12, Chapter 56, Virāṭa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Tumburu was present at the Aśvamedhayāga of
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira. (Śloka 39, Chapter 88, Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Tumburu was born as Virādha.%} When Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa were in the forests in exile a demon named
[Page799-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Virādha attacked them. That demon was none other
<div n="lb"/>than Tumburu. Once when Tumburu was living in the
<div n="lb"/>city of Kubera he committed a sin and Kubera cursed
<div n="lb"/>him and made him into a demon. Kubera had then
<div n="lb"/>told him that he would get relief from the curse when
<div n="lb"/>he was slain by Rāma, son of Daśaratha. Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>killed Virādha and the latter regaining the form of
<div n="lb"/>Tumburu left for Gandharvaloka. (See under Virādha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How he cursed Purūravas.%} It is found in Kathāsaritsā-
<div n="lb"/>gara that the temporary separation which Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>had from Urvaśī was due to a curse by the Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>Tumburu.
<div n="NI"/>After marrying Urvaśī Purūravas once went to Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka at the invitation of Indra. He was invited to help
<div n="lb"/>Indra in his fight against the asuras. Indra celebrated
<div n="lb"/>the day on which one of the best of the demons, Māyā-
<div n="lb"/>dhara was killed. Rambhā was dancing before ācārya
<div n="lb"/>Tumburu on the occasion and Purūravas finding fault
<div n="lb"/>with her dance mocked at her. Rambhā felt insulted
<div n="lb"/>and asked the King thus: “Fool of a King, what do
<div n="lb"/>you know of the divine dances of Devaloka?” Purūra-
<div n="lb"/>vas retorted that he had learnt more of dancing from
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī than what her preceptor Tumburu knew. Tum-
<div n="lb"/>buru got angry and cursed Purūravas that he would
<div n="lb"/>live separated from Urvaśī till he did penance to please
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. The Gandharvas then carried away
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī from Purūravas. (See under Purūravas).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Tumburu was a member of the court of Indra.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 14, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Tumburu was a member of the court of Kubera.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 26, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The songs of Tumburu who was a worshipper of
<div n="lb"/>Kubera used to be heard from the mountain of Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dhamādana on the full-moon day. (Śloka 29, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>159, Vana Parva).
