RAIBHYA IV¦. One of the sons of Brahmā. Once Raibhya
<div n="lb"/>went with Vasu and Aṅgiras to Bṛhaspati and asked him
<div n="lb"/>several questions, about the attainment of Supernal bliss.
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati replied that attainment of heaven could be
<div n="lb"/>had, not by action but only by devotion. Raibhya
<div n="lb"/>immediately started to Gayā to do penance. There
<div n="lb"/>he met with the Sanatkumāras. (Varāha Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Urvaśī made an earnest effort to hinder the severe vow
<div n="lb"/>and penance of Raibhya. But it was of no use, and by
<div n="lb"/>his curse, that celestial woman became ugly. She
<div n="lb"/>entreated him for liberation from the curse. Raibhya
<div n="lb"/>blessed her and said that she could obtain her original
<div n="lb"/>form by bathing in Yodhinīkuṇḍa. (Yoginī Kuṇḍa).
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī bathed in Yodhinīkuṇḍa and from that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards that tīrtha (holy bath) came to be known as
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśīyoginīkuṇḍa.
