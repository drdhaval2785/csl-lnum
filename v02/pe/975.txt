BHADRAKĀLĪ¦. Another form of Pārvatī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Lord Śiva, on hearing about the self-
<div n="lb"/>immolation in fire of his wife, Satī at the famous yajña
<div n="lb"/>conducted by Dakṣa rushed in all anger to the spot,
[Page109-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and beat the earth with his matted hair, and there ensu-
<div n="lb"/>ed two forces called Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī. This
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrakālī was really Satī or Pārvatī in another form.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Bhadrakālī and Kaṃsa.%} There is a story in the Daśama-
<div n="lb"/>Skandha of Bhāgavata that Kaṃsa took away from
<div n="lb"/>the room in which Devakī had delivered Śrī Kṛṣṇa the
<div n="lb"/>child of Yaśodā by whom Kṛṣṇa had been replaced,
<div n="lb"/>and dashed the child against a rock, and that the
<div n="lb"/>child then escaped from his clutches and rose up to the
<div n="lb"/>sky. That child was Bhadrakālī in another form. (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kampa, Laṅkālakṣmī and Bhadrakālī.%} Laṅkālakṣmī,
<div n="lb"/>who was guarding the city of Laṅkā, was the first to
<div n="lb"/>prevent Hanumān from entering the city. Tamil
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas aver that this Laṅkālakṣmī was an incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Bhadrakālī. Hanumān thrashed Laṅkālakṣmī with
<div n="lb"/>his left hand at which she vomitted blood and fell down
<div n="lb"/>unconscious. On regaining consciousness remembrance
<div n="lb"/>of the past occurred to her, and after thanking Hanumān,
<div n="lb"/>who restored her to her former form, she returned to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa. She complained to Śiva that she could not
<div n="lb"/>witness the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. Then Śiva told her
<div n="lb"/>thus:
<div n="NI"/>“You go to the Drāviḍa country and be put up in the
<div n="lb"/>‘Svayambhūliṅga’ temple there. I shall be born there
<div n="lb"/>as Kampa, compose the Rāmāyaṇa in Tamil and get
<div n="lb"/>conducted the dolls-play. Then you would be able to
<div n="lb"/>enjoy the story of Śrī Rāma, especially the Rāma-Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>war, both by hearing and seeing the same in better
<div n="lb"/>manner than by actually seeing the war.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadrakālī acted according to this bidding of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>There lived a great scholar named Saṅkaranārāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>close to the temple. His wife was Ciṅkāravallī. Lord
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, as decided upon previously was born as the son
<div n="lb"/>of Ciṅkāravallī, who had become a widow while she
<div n="lb"/>was worshipping ‘Svayambhūdeva’ for the gift of a
<div n="lb"/>child. But, Ciṅkāravallī, who feared scandal in her,
<div n="lb"/>a widow, becoming a mother, forsook the child in the
<div n="lb"/>temple precincts and left the place. One Gaṇeśakaunta
<div n="lb"/>sighted the orphan child, and took it to Jayappavallan,
<div n="lb"/>the Kaunta chief. The Kaunta chief, who was without
<div n="lb"/>children brought up the orphan child as though it had
<div n="lb"/>been his own child. Since the child was recovered from
<div n="lb"/>the foot of the flagstaff it was named Kampa. Kampa,
<div n="lb"/>who was very intelligent even in his infancy, but lazy by
<div n="lb"/>nature turned out to be a great scholar and good poet
<div n="lb"/>in Tamil by the time he grew up to be a youth, and
<div n="lb"/>he became, consequently a prominent member in the
<div n="lb"/>‘poets’ assembly’ of King Cola. When to his name was
<div n="lb"/>added the plural suffix ‘r’ as a token of great respect
<div n="lb"/>he came to be known as Kampar.
<div n="NI"/>Once King Cola asked Kampar and Oṭṭakkūtta another
<div n="lb"/>member of the poets’ assembly to compose in Tamil
<div n="lb"/>poetry the story of Śrī Rāma. The King's direction was
<div n="lb"/>that. Oṭṭakkūtta should compose his poem upto the
<div n="lb"/>incident, Setubandhana (building a bridge in the sea up
<div n="lb"/>to Laṅkā) and Kampar should write the story of the
<div n="lb"/>war in his poem. Oṭṭakkūtta completed the task allotted
<div n="lb"/>to him within six months. But Kampar had not attempt-
<div n="lb"/>ed to write even a single line. Having been informed
<div n="lb"/>about the matter the King ordered that the poem, Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa should be recited in the assembly the very next
<div n="lb"/>day itself. Kampar, who began writing his poem the
<div n="lb"/>same day with the object of completing it in the night
<div n="lb"/>itself fell asleep without writing anything at all. When
[Page110-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Kampar awoke early in the morning he saw a divine
<div n="lb"/>form disappearing from his room, and exclaimed, “Oh!
<div n="lb"/>mother! you have slipped away”. To this the divine
<div n="lb"/>form replies, “Oh Kampar! I have finished writing”.
<div n="lb"/>And, then the divine form vanished completely.
<div n="NI"/>When Kampar got completely out of sleep and looked
<div n="lb"/>about he found the Rāmāyaṇa story fully written in
<div n="lb"/>verse on his desk. Kampar inferred that the poem was
<div n="lb"/>composed by Śāradābhagavatī, the presiding deity of
<div n="lb"/>learning and literature, and he was wonder-struck. He
<div n="lb"/>recited the poem in the royal assembly, and the King
<div n="lb"/>and others too were wonder-struck. And, afterwards,
<div n="lb"/>according to the orders of the King the story of the war
<div n="lb"/>(Yuddhakāṇḍa Kathā) began to be exhibited as dolls-
<div n="lb"/>play in the presence of the idol of the Devī in the
<div n="lb"/>temple. Thus Śiva incarnated himself as Kampar,
<div n="lb"/>recited the story of the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war in the temple,
<div n="lb"/>and hearing it Bhadrakālī danced.
<div n="NI"/>The above is the chief legend about Kampar.
