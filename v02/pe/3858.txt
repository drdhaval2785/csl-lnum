KUṆIGARGA¦. A reputed sage. By severe austerities he
<div n="lb"/>increased his spiritual powers, created a girl by his
<div n="lb"/>mental power, and afterwards entered into Samādhi.
<div n="lb"/>The girl, who did not relish the idea of marriage, began
<div n="lb"/>penance in solitude, and she grew old. In the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata she is known as Vṛddhakanyā (Old Virgin). In
<div n="lb"/>the evening of her life she longed to give up her
<div n="lb"/>material body and to attain salvation. At this juncture
<div n="lb"/>Nārada told her that salvation was not for unmarried
<div n="lb"/>women. She, therefore, gave half the power of her
<div n="lb"/>penance to a young man called Śṛṅgavān and lived as
<div n="lb"/>his wife for one single night. She thus attained salvation
<div n="lb"/>(Śalya Parva, Chapter 52).
