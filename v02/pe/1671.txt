DAKṢIṆĀ¦. A daughter, born to Prajāpati Ruci, by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Ākūti. The first Manu was Svāyambhuva, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. He accepted Śatarūpā, his sister who be-
<div n="lb"/>came sinless by penance, as his wife. Śatarūpā gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to two sons Priyavrata and Uttānapāda, and two
<div n="lb"/>daughters, Prasūti and Ākūti. Of these two daughters,
<div n="lb"/>Prasūtī was given to Prajāpati Dakṣa and Ākūti to
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati Ruci. Ākūti gave birth to twins, a son named
<div n="lb"/>Yajña and a daughter named Dakṣiṇā. To Yajña
<div n="lb"/>twelve sons were born by Dakṣiṇā. They were a class
<div n="lb"/>of devas (gods) called the Yāmas in the regime of Manu
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 7).
<div n="lb"/>Now Dakṣiṇā is worshipped as a goddess. The same
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇā was reborn in the Goloka under the name
<div n="lb"/>Suśīlā. At that time she was a cowherd woman and
<div n="lb"/>friend of Rādhā. She liked to talk with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. One
<div n="lb"/>day Rādhā saw her sitting in the lap of Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>engaged in sexual sports, in a secluded place. When
<div n="lb"/>Suśīlā saw that Rādhā had found them out, she be-
<div n="lb"/>came dumbfounded with shame, and sat with bowed
<div n="lb"/>head. Śrī Kṛṣṇa slowly placed Suśīlā devi down and
<div n="lb"/>instantly vanished. The angry Rādhā cursed Suśīlā to
<div n="lb"/>become ashes if ever she entered the Goloka again. Then
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā ran about everywhere in search of Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>but he could not be found.
<div n="NI"/>Immediately after the curse, Suśīlā got down from the
<div n="lb"/>Goloka and began to worship Mahālakṣmī with devotion
<div n="lb"/>and meditation and very severe fast and vow. After
<div n="lb"/>a long time Mahālakṣmī appeared to her and blessed
<div n="lb"/>her, and Suśīlā became absorbed in Mahālakṣmī.
<div n="lb"/>Since the absorption of Suśīlā devī, who was the rebirth
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣiṇādevī, in Mahālakṣmī, the sacrifice of the
<div n="lb"/>devas (gods) became fruitless. They were much grieved.
<div n="lb"/>They all went to Brahmā to find a solution. As the matter
<div n="lb"/>was serious Brahmā meditated upon Viṣṇu, who
[Page195-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>became pleased with Brahmā and to save the devas, he
<div n="lb"/>attracted Dakṣiṇādevī from the body of Mahālakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>and gave her as a present to Brahmā. Brahmā gave that
<div n="lb"/>devī (goddess) to Yajñapuruṣa (the god of sacrifice)
<div n="lb"/>so that the sacrifices of gods might become fruitful.
<div n="lb"/>When Yajñapuruṣa saw that supernatural beauty he was
<div n="lb"/>overpowered by lust and swooned. The couple spent a
<div n="lb"/>hundred divine years in seclusion enjoying the company
<div n="lb"/>of each other, as a result of which devī became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>The pregnancy matured in twelve divine years and she
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to a child which was named Phalada. It is
<div n="lb"/>this same Phalada, the son of Yajñapuruṣa and Dakṣiṇā
<div n="lb"/>who awards fruits to all actions. The learned men say
<div n="lb"/>that Yajñapuruṣa, Dakṣiṇādevī and Phalada divide the
<div n="lb"/>fruits of actions among the doers. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 9).
