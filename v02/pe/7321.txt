SUTAPAS VII¦. A hermit. This hermit once approached

<div n="lb"/>to become an animal. Utpalāvatī begged for liberation
<div n="lb"/>from the curse. Sutapas felt pity for her and blessed
<div n="lb"/>her thus:—“A son named Lola will be born to you.
<div n="lb"/>He will become the Manu of Tāmasa Manvantara.”
