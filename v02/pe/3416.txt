KAUṆḌINYA III¦. A hermit. This hermit had erected his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage in Hastimatīsabhramatīsaṅgama and lived
<div n="lb"/>there. Once due to excess of rain the river flooded and
<div n="lb"/>his hermitage was washed away. So the hermit cursed
<div n="lb"/>the river. “Let the river be dried up”. Then he went
<div n="lb"/>to the realm of Vaikuṇṭha. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Chapter 145).
