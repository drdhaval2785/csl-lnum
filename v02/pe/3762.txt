KUJṚMBHA¦. A very powerful and valiant Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>who possessed an iron rod named Sunanda. He had
<div n="lb"/>earned the boon that the rod would lose its power
<div n="lb"/>only on contact with women. He lived underground in
<div n="lb"/>a thick forest on the banks of the river Nirvindhyā.
<div n="lb"/>Once he abducted Mudāvatī, the beautiful daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Viḍūratha, King of Vaiśālī. At last Vatsapri, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Bhalandana made Mudāvatī touch the iron rod of
<div n="lb"/>the Asura, which became powerless because of the
<div n="lb"/>touch of a woman, and then he (Vatsapri) killed the
<div n="lb"/>Asura. Vatsapri then married Mudāvatī. (Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 116).
