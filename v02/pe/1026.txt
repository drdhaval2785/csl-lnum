BHĀṆḌĪRA¦(M). An ancient forest. It was in this
<div n="lb"/>forest situated in Aṃbāḍi that Śri Kṛṣṇa with his cow-
<div n="lb"/>herd chums conducted his childhood exploits. There
<div n="lb"/>was a very huge tree of name Bhāṇḍīra in this forest
<div n="lb"/>and it was under this great tree that Kṛṣṇa and his
<div n="lb"/>friends met daily for their play. This forest is on the
<div n="lb"/>northern bank of Gaṅgā in front of Keśighaṭṭa in
<div n="lb"/>Vṛndāvana. The Purāṇas proclaim that it was here that
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā conducted the marriage of Kṛṣṇa with Rādhā.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 38, Sabhā Parva, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, M.B.).
