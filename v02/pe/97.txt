AHIṂSĀ¦. Non-injury. There are opinions both in favour
<div n="lb"/>of and against Ahiṃsā in the purāṇas. Śukrācārya ex-
<div n="lb"/>tols the importance of Ahiṃsā to the asuras (demons)
<div n="lb"/>thus:
<Poem>Bho! Devaripavaḥ satyaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Bravīmi bhavatāṃ hitam
<div n="lb"/>Ahiṃsā paramo dharmo
<div n="lb"/>Hantavyā hyātatāyinaḥ
<div n="lb"/>Dvijairbhogaratairvede
<div n="lb"/>Darśitaṃ hiṃsanam paśoḥ
<div n="lb"/>Jihvāsvādaparaiḥ Kāma—
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṃsaiva parā matā.</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>“Oh, foes of the devas, I shall tell you the truth which is
<div n="lb"/>good for you. Non-injury to any living being is the most
<div n="lb"/>righteous thing. Do not molest even those who come to
<div n="lb"/>kill you. Even that act would be ‘hiṃsā’ (injury). It
<div n="lb"/>was those brahmins who were attached to worldly plea-
<div n="lb"/>sures and addicted to overeating that enjoined in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas that hiṃsā is permissible for yāgas.” (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skanda 4). Mārkaṇḍeya Muni (sage) says thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Why should I mind the innumerable killings going on
<div n="lb"/>unnoticed in this world full of life. People of old speak
<div n="lb"/>very sacredly about Ahiṃsā. But O best of brahmins,
<div n="lb"/>who can live in this world without injury to another
<div n="lb"/>life?” (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Ślokas 32 & 33, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>208).
