GODILA II¦. A servant of Vaiśravaṇa. Once when
<div n="lb"/>Godila was travelling by air he saw Padmāvatī, wife
[Page293-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of Ugrasena, King of Vidarbha, bathing in a pond
<div n="lb"/>along with her companions. The very sight of the
<div n="lb"/>enchanting Padmāvatī roused carnal passions in him
<div n="lb"/>and the Yakṣa took the form of Ugrasena and started
<div n="lb"/>singing from the top of a hillock nearby. Padmāvatī
<div n="lb"/>went to him because she mistook him for her husband.
<div n="lb"/>Embracing her passionately the Yakṣa outraged her
<div n="lb"/>modesty. Subtle differences in the act created doubts
<div n="lb"/>in Padmāvatī and, on being questioned, the Yakṣa told
<div n="lb"/>the truth and left the place. (Chapter 49, Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
