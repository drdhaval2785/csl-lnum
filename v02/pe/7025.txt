SUKEŚA¦ (SUKEŚĪ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information%} A rākṣasa (giant) who was the
<div n="lb"/>son of Vidyutkeśa and Sālakaṭaṅkā. When Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>asked the Subjects to look after his creation those who
<div n="lb"/>said ‘Rakṣāmahe’ became Rākṣasas (giants) and those
<div n="lb"/>who said ‘Yakṣāmahe’, the Yakṣas (a clan of semi gods).
<div n="lb"/>Once two brothers named Heti and Praheti were born
[Page759-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in the clan of Rākṣasas. Praheti remained unmarried and
<div n="lb"/>entered the life of penance. Heti married Bhayā the sister
<div n="lb"/>of Kāla. A son named Vidyutkeśa was born to the cou-
<div n="lb"/>ple. Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā. Sālakaṭaṅkā delivered a son. But wishing
<div n="lb"/>to enjoy the company of her husband, she abandoned
<div n="lb"/>the son and lived with her husband. The child which
<div n="lb"/>was as bright as the rising Sun, putting its folded fist
<div n="lb"/>in its mouth, cried aloud. Paramaśiva and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>who were travelling along the sky mounted on the bull,
<div n="lb"/>heard the cry of the infant and looked at the spot from
<div n="lb"/>which the cry arose. On seeing the infant, Pārvatī took
<div n="lb"/>pity on it. Śiva blessed the child, which instantly grew
<div n="lb"/>as old as its mother. Śiva gave the Rākṣasa prince
<div n="lb"/>immortality and a city which could travel through the
<div n="lb"/>sky. Pārvatī said that Rākṣasa women would, in future
<div n="lb"/>deliver the moment they became pregnant and that the
<div n="lb"/>child would grow equal to its mother in age, as soon as
<div n="lb"/>it was born. Sukeśa was the son of Vidyutkeśa and
<div n="lb"/>Sālakaṭaṅkā. Sukeśa was delighted at the boons he
<div n="lb"/>got, and travelled wherever he pleased, in his city.
<div n="NI"/>Sukeśa married Devavatī the daughter of Grāmaṇī a
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva. Mālī, Sumālī and Mālyavān were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of this couple. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The city of Sukeśa fell on the ground.%} Sukeśa pleased
<div n="lb"/>Śiva by penance. Śiva made him invincible and gave
<div n="lb"/>him a city which travelled through the sky. Because of
<div n="lb"/>these boons, the Rākṣasa became righteous and pious.
<div n="lb"/>He lived in the city with other Rākṣasas. Once Sukeśa
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest Māgadha and visited the hermits
<div n="lb"/>there. He asked them about the means to attain pros-
<div n="lb"/>perity in this world and the other worlds. The hermits
<div n="lb"/>gave him long exhortations. They told him about the
<div n="lb"/>various hells given to sinners. Thus Sukeśa became
<div n="lb"/>righteous-minded and saintly. He returned to his
<div n="lb"/>city and called together all the other Rākṣasas and
<div n="lb"/>spoke to them about what he had learned from the
<div n="lb"/>hermits. He said: “The hermits taught me the means
<div n="lb"/>to attain heaven. They are Non-killing, Truth, not
<div n="lb"/>stealing, cleanliness, control of all outward going ener-
<div n="lb"/>gies, liberality, kindness, forgiveness, abstinence, good
<div n="lb"/>usages etc. So it is my order that all of you observe
<div n="lb"/>these good things.” The Rākṣasas were pleased at the
<div n="lb"/>words of Sukeśa. They began to lead a righteous life.
<div n="lb"/>In this way they got wealth and prosperity. Their
<div n="lb"/>radiance increased to such an extent that the Sun and
<div n="lb"/>the moon and the stars found it difficult to continue
<div n="lb"/>their travels.
<div n="NI"/>Thus the city of the Rākṣasa shone as the sun in the day
<div n="lb"/>and as the moon in the night. The progress of the Sun
<div n="lb"/>in the day became indiscernible. Due to its brightness
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasa city seemed to be the moon and thinking
<div n="lb"/>that it was night, the lotus flowers folded in the day
<div n="lb"/>and bloomed in the night. Havoc was caused in the
<div n="lb"/>earth as well as in the world of the gods. The sun be-
<div n="lb"/>came unpopular. So he tried to find out the cause. At
<div n="lb"/>last he found out the cause. He became angry. He
<div n="lb"/>looked with fury at the city of the Rākṣasas. Hit by
<div n="lb"/>the look, the city lost its merits and began to sink down
<div n="lb"/>to the earth.
<div n="NI"/>When the city fell down Sukeśa called Śiva and cried
<div n="lb"/>aloud. Śiva looked round to see what happened to his
<div n="lb"/>devotee. He understood that the sun was the culprit.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva looked at the sun with furious eyes. Instantly the
<div n="lb"/>sun was dropped from the Solar region to the air. The
[Page759-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>hermits saw the Sun coming slowly to the earth. They
<div n="lb"/>called out loudly. “If you want to be well in falling,
<div n="lb"/>go and fall in Harikṣetra.” The sun called out, “What
<div n="lb"/>is Harikṣetra?” “Harikṣetra is Vārāṇasī from Yogaśāyī
<div n="lb"/>to Keśavadarśana”, the hermits replied. Hearing this
<div n="lb"/>the Sun fell in Vārāṇasī. Then to lessen the heat the
<div n="lb"/>sun dipped and splashed in Asi tīrtha and Varuṇā
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā knew this, and informed Śiva of it. Śiva came to
<div n="lb"/>Vārāṇasī and took the sun by his hands and gave him the
<div n="lb"/>name ‘Lola’ and sent him back in the chariot. After
<div n="lb"/>that Brahmā went to Sukeśa and sent his city with the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas in it, back to the sky, and the Sun was fixed
<div n="lb"/>in the sky as before. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 15)
