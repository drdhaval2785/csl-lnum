SANDHYĀRĀGA¦. The red colour seen in the sky in
<div n="lb"/>the evening is Sandhyārāga. Rāgiṇī the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Himavān did penance to obtain Paramaśiva as husband.

<div n="lb"/>was not able to bear the radiance of Śiva. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>this opinion Rāgiṇī got angry and Brahmā cursed her
<div n="lb"/>and changed her into Sandhyārāga. (See under Pārvatī).
