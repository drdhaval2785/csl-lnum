AṄGĀRAKĀ¦. (SIṂHIKĀ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended in the following order from
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Brahmā-Marīci-Kaśyapa-Aṅgārakā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} In the battle between the Gods and the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, most of the Asuras were killed and one Asura
<div n="lb"/>fled from the clutches of death to Pātāla (the nether
<div n="lb"/>world). Surasā was the daughter of that Asura. Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>married Surasā. To them were born the two daughters,
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgārakā (Siṃhikā) and Ajāmukhī, and four sons,
<div n="lb"/>called Śūrapadma, Siṃhavaktra, Tārakāsura and
<div n="lb"/>Gomukha. Thus Siṃhikā is the sister of Tārakāsura.
<div n="lb"/>(Skanḍa Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>{%Other details.%} This giantess Aṅgārakā had a clash once,
<div n="lb"/>with Hanūmān. Sugrīva had sent a large number of
<div n="lb"/>monkeys under the leadership of Hanumān to search
<div n="lb"/>for Sītā. He gave Hanūmān certain instructions regard-
<div n="lb"/>ing the route he had to follow. Sugrīva said, “There is
<div n="lb"/>a giantess in the middle of that Southern Sea. Her
<div n="lb"/>name is Aṅgāra. She pulls the shadow towards her and
<div n="lb"/>feeds on the object of the shadow.”
<div n="NI"/>From this it is clear that she was a giantess who lived
<div n="lb"/>in the sea between Laṅkā and South India. She knew
<div n="lb"/>the art of bringing to her side, anybody who passed
<div n="lb"/>over the sea, by pulling at his shadow. When Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>jumped to Laṅkā from the mountain of Mahendra the
<div n="lb"/>giantess attacked Hanūmān. It is seen that the name
[Page040-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhikā also is used for Aṅgārakā. Hanūmān who was
<div n="lb"/>subjected to the excessive attraction of Siṃhikā, felt a
<div n="lb"/>great storm raging round him. Finally he found her out,
<div n="lb"/>a monster with such an uncouth face and a mouth as
<div n="lb"/>wide as the hole of Pātāla (the nether world). There
<div n="lb"/>was a terrible fight between Hanūmān and the monster,
<div n="lb"/>in which Siṃhikā, fell on the ground beaten. After the
<div n="lb"/>fight Hanūmān resumed his journey. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Sundarakāṇḍa, Sarga 1, Stanzas 178 to 186).
