SŪTA¦ I
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A hermit who recounted the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas to other hermits at Naimiṣa forest. He was a
<div n="lb"/>disciple of Vyāsa. Vyāsa composed the Purāṇas and
<div n="lb"/>taught them to his son, hermit Śuka who was a man of
<div n="lb"/>abstinence and who was not born of womb. At this time
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa had another disciple named Sūta. It is stated in
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, that this Sūta who was a
<div n="lb"/>fellow disciple of Śuka, who had learned all the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>directly from the teacher Vyāsa, and who was capable
<div n="lb"/>saying stories so convincingly, was the son of the her-
<div n="lb"/>mit Lomaharṣa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%In Naimiṣāraṇya.%} Sūta who had learned the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>directly form Vyāsa, happened to reach Naimiṣāraṇya
<div n="lb"/>once. (See under Naimiṣāraṇya). Naimiṣāraṇya is
<div n="lb"/>the abode of hermits in the Kali-age. In days of old,
<div n="lb"/>hermits, who were miserable because of the evils of Kali-
<div n="lb"/>yuga, which was fast approaching, gathered here at the
<div n="lb"/>end of Dvāparayuga. They went to the world of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>to consult about the means and ways of preventing the
[Page774-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>evils of Kaliyuga. Having heard their complaints Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>brought a wheel of the figure of mind and placing it be-
<div n="lb"/>fore the hermits told them thus: “You follow this wheel.
<div n="lb"/>The place where this wheel falls down will be a place of
<div n="lb"/>purity, which will not be affected by the evils of Kali-
<div n="lb"/>age. There you can live in peace, without being affected
<div n="lb"/>by the evils of Kali-age till the coming of the Satya-
<div n="lb"/>yuga.” Saying these words Brahmā set the wheel rolling
<div n="lb"/>in front of them. The hermits followed it. The wheel
<div n="lb"/>rolled on till it reached the earth, fell down and was
<div n="lb"/>crumbled to powder in a particular place. That place
<div n="lb"/>became famous later under the name Naimiṣāraṇya.
<div n="lb"/>Sūta came to this place.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as they saw Sūta, the hermits such as Śaunaka
<div n="lb"/>and others who were living there welcomed Sūta with
<div n="lb"/>hospitality and told him thus: “Oh! hermit, you are
<div n="lb"/>the disciple of Vyāsa. You have learned the eighteen
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas from Vyāsa We are eager to hear them. So
<div n="lb"/>please recite to us the Purāṇas, the hearing of which
<div n="lb"/>will remit all sins and secure heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>According to this request Sūta recited the eighteen
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇasto the gathering of the hermits. It is in the form
<div n="lb"/>of the teaching of Sūta to Śaunaka and the others, i.e.
<div n="lb"/>in the form of a dialogue between Sūta and Śaunaka,
<div n="lb"/>that the people got the Purāṇas. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha I).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sūta was beheaded.%} In Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, there
<div n="lb"/>occurs a story, stating how Balabhadrarāma cut off the
<div n="lb"/>head of Sūta as the battle of Kurukṣetra had started
<div n="lb"/>when Sūta had been reciting the eighteen Purāṇas in
<div n="lb"/>Naimiṣāraṇya and how his head was fixed in its place
<div n="lb"/>again and he was brought to life. (For further details see
<div n="lb"/>under Balabhadrarāma, Para 6).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} Sūta was one of the hermits who visited
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma on his bed of arrows during the battle of
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 47 Verse 12).
