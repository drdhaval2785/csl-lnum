BUDHA IV¦. A Brāhmaṇa who lived in Gauḍadeśa.
<div n="lb"/>Budha who was the incarnation of all vices drank too
<div n="lb"/>much and spent a whole night lying unconscious on
<div n="lb"/>the veranda of the house of a harlot. His father became
<div n="lb"/>anxious about him as he had not returned though the
<div n="lb"/>night had advanced much. He searched everywhere
<div n="lb"/>and finally came to the place where he was lying un-
<div n="lb"/>conscious. He reviled the son, who getting angry
<div n="lb"/>killed his father then and there.
<div n="NI"/>After that he returned home. His mother advised him
<div n="lb"/>to leave off his vices. His wife shed tears before him.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing that his mother and wife were impediments
<div n="lb"/>on his way, he put an end to their lives.
<div n="NI"/>Once this Brāhmaṇa carried away Sulabhā the beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful wife of hermit Kālabhūti and ravished her. Sulabhā
<div n="lb"/>cursed him and made him a leper.
<div n="NI"/>Budha wandered about and reached the city of King
<div n="lb"/>Śūrasena. On that day the King was about to go to
<div n="lb"/>Heaven with the entire city by aeroplane. However
<div n="lb"/>hard the pilots might try the plane would not move an
<div n="lb"/>inch. Then the devas told the King: “Drive away
<div n="lb"/>the leper there. The vices of that sinful murderer
<div n="lb"/>have made the plane stationary.”
<div n="NI"/>Śūrasena who was kind and righteous, neared the leper
<div n="lb"/>and cured him with caturākṣarīmantra (a spell of four
<div n="lb"/>letters) and got ready to take him also to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(Gaṇeśa Purāṇa 1:76).
