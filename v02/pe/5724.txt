ṚCĪKA¦ I (AJĪGARTA). A famous sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing order-Brahmā-Bhṛgu-Cyavana-Ūrva-Ṛcīka. Ṛcīka
<div n="lb"/>was the father of Jamadagni and grandfather of Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ṛcīka's marriage.%} Gādhi, a king of the Lunar dynasty
<div n="lb"/>had a daughter, Satyavatī. Ṛcīka wished to marry this
<div n="lb"/>beautiful princess. Gādhi agreed to give his daughter
<div n="lb"/>in marriage to the sage if he gave 1,000 horses with
<div n="lb"/>black ears. Ṛcīka offered worship to Varuṇa to help him
<div n="lb"/>in the matter. Varuṇa was pleased and a thousand
<div n="lb"/>horses rose up from the river Gaṅgā. Ṛcīka married
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī after giving the horses. Afterwards both of
<div n="lb"/>them went and settled down in the forest.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth of Jamadagni.%} One day Satyavatī made a request
<div n="lb"/>to Ṛcīka that she should have a son. Besides, she request-
<div n="lb"/>ed him that her mother should be blessed with a son,
<div n="lb"/>so that she might have a brother. Ṛcīka performed a
<div n="lb"/>“homa” and after that he made two balls of rice and
<div n="lb"/>gave them to Satyavatī. He advised her to eat one of
<div n="lb"/>them and to give the other to her mother. Ṛcīka had put
<div n="lb"/>“Brahmatejas” (brilliance of Brahmins) in the first rice-
<div n="lb"/>ball and “Kṣātratejas” (brilliance of Kṣatriyas) in the
<div n="lb"/>other. When Satyavatī and her mother ate the rice-
<div n="lb"/>balls, it so happened that the rice-ball intended for her
<div n="lb"/>mother was eaten by Satyavatī and the one intended for
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī was eaten by the mother. Later Ṛcīka came to
<div n="lb"/>know of this mistake. In due course, Satyavatī and her
<div n="lb"/>mother gave birth to sons, Satyavatī's son was named
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 57).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other sons of Ṛcīka.%} After this three more sons were born
<div n="lb"/>to Ṛcīka. The eldest of them was named Śunaḥpuccha,
<div n="lb"/>the second was named Śunaśśepha and the third,
<div n="lb"/>Śunolāṅgūla.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The sale of Śunaśśepha.%} Once king Ambarīṣa started a
<div n="lb"/>yāga. Indra who was jealous of him, stole the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>cow. Since it was an evil omen, the priest advised Am-
<div n="lb"/>barīṣa that either the lost cow or a human being in its place
<div n="lb"/>must be obtained to complete the yāga. In spite of sear-
<div n="lb"/>ches made in many places, the cow could not be traced.
<div n="lb"/>At last Ambarīṣa's men met Ṛcīka who was doing tapas
<div n="lb"/>on Bhṛgutuṅga. Ṛcīka sold his second son, Śunaśśepha
<div n="lb"/>to Aṃbarīṣa in exchange for the price of 100,000 cows.
[Page648-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>The king took Śunaśśepha with him and came to Puṣkara-
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha. There they happened to meet Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>Śunaśśepha complained to Viśvāmitra and lamented
<div n="lb"/>over his ill-fate. Viśvāmitra wished to save him and to
<div n="lb"/>send one of his own sons in his place with Ambarīṣa.
<div n="lb"/>But none of his sons was willing to oblige. Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>cursed them and turned them into eaters of human
<div n="lb"/>flesh. Then he turned to Śunaśśepha and said:
<div n="NI"/>“When you stand ready to be sacrificed near the altar,
<div n="lb"/>offer your prayers to Agni. If you do so, you will attain
<div n="lb"/>siddhi.” (salvation or mokṣa). He also taught him two
<div n="lb"/>songs of praise to Agni.
<div n="NI"/>While standing at the altar ready to be sacrificed
<div n="lb"/>Sunaśśepha recited the two songs of praise. Indra and
<div n="lb"/>the other gods appeared and after saving Śunaśśepha
<div n="lb"/>rewarded Ambarīṣa for his yāga. (Vālmīki Ramāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, 62nd Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Ṛcīka and the Vaiṣṇava bow.%} Once Viśvakarmā made two
<div n="lb"/>mighty bows. One of them was taken by Śiva to burn
<div n="lb"/>the Tripuras. That bow is known as “Śaivacāpa”. The
<div n="lb"/>other bow was given to Viṣṇu. It is called “Vaiṣṇava-
<div n="lb"/>cāpa”. The Devas wished to see a trial of strength bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween Śiva and Viṣṇu. They prompted Brahmā to bring
<div n="lb"/>about such a conflict. Brahmā succeeded in causing a
<div n="lb"/>quarrel between Śiva and Viṣṇu. A fight began between
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Viṣṇu. Both the Śaivacāpa and Vaiṣṇavacāpa
<div n="lb"/>went into action. But Śiva was defeated. After that, Siva
<div n="lb"/>gave his bow to Devarāta, king of Videha. By inheritance
<div n="lb"/>it came into the hands of king Janaka, the father of Śītā.
<div n="lb"/>It was this bow which was broken by Śrī Rāma at the
<div n="lb"/>time of Sītā's Svayaṃvara.
<div n="NI"/>After the battle with Śiva, Viṣṇu gave his bow to
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka who, in turn gave it to Jamadagni. Jamadagni
<div n="lb"/>presented it to his son Paraśurāma. It was with this
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavacāpa that Paraśurāma confronted Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>who was returning after Sītā's Svayaṃvara. (Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, 75th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Ṛcīka was given 1,000 white horses with black ears
<div n="lb"/>which could run fast, by Gādhi as dowry. Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>presented these horses on the bank of the river Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>The place in Gaṅgā where the horses rose up, came to
<div n="lb"/>be called “Aśvatīrtha”. Gādhi gave Satyavatī to
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka at the place called ‘Kanyākubja’. (M.B. Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 115).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahābhārata, Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapter 29,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 23 says that Ṛcīka once tried to stop Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>from killing Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Dyutimān, King of Sālva, presented a tract
<div n="lb"/>of land to Ṛcīka. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 137,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 28).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Ṛcīka attained Vaikuṇṭha and his wife Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>accompanied him in her earthly body. It is said that
<div n="lb"/>after it, Satyavatī transformed herself into a river under
<div n="lb"/>the name “Kauśikī” and began to flow in north India.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, 34th Sarga).
