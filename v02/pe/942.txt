BARBARIKA¦. Son of Maurvī born of Ghaṭotkaca, son
<div n="lb"/>of Bhīma. Skanda Purāṇa gives the following details
<div n="lb"/>about him.
<div n="NI"/>Barbarika was a Yakṣa in his previous life. Once the
<div n="lb"/>devas unable to bear the insufferable harm done to
<div n="lb"/>them by the Dānavas approached Lord Mahāviṣṇu for
<div n="lb"/>help and then the Yakṣa who was present there at that
<div n="lb"/>time said with arrogance, “There is no need for Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>to curb the activities of the Dānavas. I shall do it my-
<div n="lb"/>self.” Hearing those arrogant words Brahmā cursed
<div n="lb"/>him saying that in his next life he would be killed by
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>True to the curse the Yakṣa was born in his next life
<div n="lb"/>as Barbarika, son of Ghaṭotkaca. To lessen the force of
<div n="lb"/>the curse Kṛṣṇa advised him to worship Devī. At last
<div n="lb"/>pleasing the goddess by the kindly help of a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Vijaya Barbarika killed a demoness called
<div n="lb"/>Mahājihva and a demon of name Repalendra. The
<div n="lb"/>brāhmin further gave him a weapon named Vibhūti
<div n="lb"/>which could split the vital centres of the body of an
<div n="lb"/>enemy and said, “Use this weapon against the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas who oppose the Pāṇḍavas.”
<div n="NI"/>Once Barbarika defeated his grandfather Bhīma in a
<div n="lb"/>battle and greatly grieved over the injury done started
<div n="lb"/>to commit suicide. Then Devī appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>reminded him thus, “You will get salvation only if you
<div n="lb"/>are killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa and so desist from committing
<div n="lb"/>suicide.”
[Page108-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>The great war started and Barbarika fighting on the
<div n="lb"/>side of the Pāṇḍavas started using his weapon Vibhūti.
<div n="lb"/>He sent it against all excepting the Pāṇḍavas, Kṛpā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya and Aśvatthāmā. He did not leave even Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>alone and the weapon fell on the feet of Kṛṣṇa also.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this Kṛṣṇa used his Sudarśana Cakra and
<div n="lb"/>cut off his head; at once Devī appeared and brought
<div n="lb"/>him to life. After the great battle on the advice of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa Barbarika went and lived in Guptakṣetra.
