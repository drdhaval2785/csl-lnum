KĀMBOJA I¦. Sudakṣiṇa, the King of the country,
<div n="lb"/>Kāmboja. He was present at Draupadī's svayaṃvara.
<div n="lb"/>In Mahābhārata, Karṇa Parva, Chapter 156 we read
<div n="lb"/>that his younger brother was killed by Arjuna. The
<div n="lb"/>Kings of Kāmboja were all known as Kāmbojas. Long
<div n="lb"/>ago, this country was ruled by a King named Kāmboja.
<div n="lb"/>In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 166, Verse 77,
<div n="lb"/>we see that this Kāmboja was given a sword by the
<div n="lb"/>King Dhundhumāra. Perhaps it was from this King
<div n="lb"/>Kāmboja that the country came to be called ‘Kāmboja’.
