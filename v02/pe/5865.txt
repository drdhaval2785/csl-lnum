ŚABALĀŚVA I¦. The thousand sons born to Dakṣa of
<div n="lb"/>his wife Vīraṇī, are known as Śabalāśvas. To procre-
<div n="lb"/>ate man-kind Dakṣa first created five hundred sons by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Asiknī and named them Haryaśvas.
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa had to create the Śabalāśvas as the Haryaśvas
<div n="lb"/>were misled by Nārada. But, Nārada approached and
<div n="lb"/>told the Śabalāśvas also that it was not correct on
<div n="lb"/>their part to procreate children before they had studied
<div n="lb"/>the interior, exterior, bottom and top of the earth.
<div n="lb"/>Believing Nārada's advice the Śabalāśvas also set out
<div n="lb"/>to measure the extent of the earth and they have not
<div n="lb"/>yet returned. Because of this Brahmā cursed that
<div n="lb"/>Nārada, instead of living at one place, should always
<div n="lb"/>be on the move. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 15).
