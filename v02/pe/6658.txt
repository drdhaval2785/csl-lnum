ŚIVAŚARMAN¦. A brahmin well-versed in all śāstras
<div n="lb"/>(sciences). Śivaśarman, who lived in Dvārakā had, by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Guṇavatī five sons called Yajñaśarman, Veda-
<div n="lb"/>śarman, Dharmaśarman, Viṣṇuśarman and Somaśar-
<div n="lb"/>man, all of them deeply devoted to their father. The
<div n="lb"/>father decided to test the devotion of each of the sons.
[Page732-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śivaśarman had, due to Śiva's blessing, achieved all
<div n="lb"/>kinds of siddhis (spiritual gifts). By the power of illusion
<div n="lb"/>he showed the sons their mother lying dead and all the
<div n="lb"/>sons wept uncontrollably. Then he asked his eldest son
<div n="lb"/>Yajñaśarman, to cut the dead body of his mother into
<div n="lb"/>pieces and throw them off. After having done so he came
<div n="lb"/>and saluted his father.
<div n="NI"/>After bidding adieu to Yajñaśarman, who proved his devo-
<div n="lb"/>tion to his father as above, Śivaśarman called his second
<div n="lb"/>son Vedaśarman to him and told him thus: “I find it
<div n="lb"/>difficult to get on without a woman. Look, there is a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful woman there endowed with all qualifications.
<div n="lb"/>(And he created such a woman by illusion). You go and
<div n="lb"/>fetch her to me.” Vedaśarman, after saluting his father
<div n="lb"/>went to the woman and requested her to become the
<div n="lb"/>wife of his father. But, the woman did not want to
<div n="lb"/>become the wife of an old man, and she told Vedaśar-
<div n="lb"/>man that she would love him, and not his father, to
<div n="lb"/>have as her husband. He shuddered to be told thus,
<div n="lb"/>and by the power of his tapas he got down Indra and
<div n="lb"/>other Devas on earth and showed them to her. She
<div n="lb"/>then told him in indifferent tone the following: “Yes, I
<div n="lb"/>have seen the prowess of your tapas. But, I have nothing
<div n="lb"/>to do with Devas. If you want me as wife for your
<div n="lb"/>father, please cut off your head with your own hands
<div n="lb"/>for my pleasure.” Vedaśarman drew his sword and
<div n="lb"/>very happily cut off his head and presented it to the
<div n="lb"/>woman. She came to Śivaśarman and requested him to
<div n="lb"/>accept his son's head, which he (son) had voluntarily cut
<div n="lb"/>off for the sake of his father.
<div n="NI"/>The other sons of Śivaśarman shuddered at the sight of
<div n="lb"/>their brother's head. They told among themselves thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Our mother entered eternal Samādhi, but this brother
<div n="lb"/>of ours, who courted death on behalf of father is really
<div n="lb"/>blessed.” Then Śivaśarman asked his third son Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>śarman to receive his brother's head. He received it
<div n="lb"/>and went out with it and prayed to Dharmadeva, who,
<div n="lb"/>on his appearance, was requested to restore Vedaśarman
<div n="lb"/>to life. Dharmadeva did so, and the first question
<div n="lb"/>asked by Vedaśarman, who returned to life as though
<div n="lb"/>awakened from sleep, was about the woman, whom he
<div n="lb"/>had brought as his father's wife. Then Vedaśarman
<div n="lb"/>and Dharmaśarman returned to their father, and Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>śarman told the father about his bringing back to life
<div n="lb"/>his dead brother. Though the father felt very happy
<div n="lb"/>about the great devotion of his son he did not answer
<div n="lb"/>him (son).
<div n="NI"/>Śivaśarman fell into contemplation for sometime and
<div n="lb"/>then told his fourth son, Viṣṇuśarman as follows: “You
<div n="lb"/>go immediately to Indraloka and bring amṛta (nectar)
<div n="lb"/>for me to drink along with this woman. Nectar removes
<div n="lb"/>diseases. Now, this woman has no interest in me. It is
<div n="lb"/>only natural that young, beautiful women will feel no
<div n="lb"/>love towards an old man and unless I regain my youth
<div n="lb"/>this woman of mine may sleep with others. You, my son,
<div n="lb"/>should act in such a manner that I can enjoy life with
<div n="lb"/>this woman in all the three worlds.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as he heard his father, Viṣṇuśarman, by the
<div n="lb"/>power of his tapas ascended to the sky and started for
<div n="lb"/>Indraloka. Being told about the object of his visit Indra
<div n="lb"/>deputed Menakā to make him withdraw from the plan.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately Menakā put on her best clothes and sing-
<div n="lb"/>ing sweet music occupied the hanging seat in Nanda-
<div n="lb"/>navana, and Viṣṇu arman lost not a minute to divine
<div n="lb"/>the object of her presence. Without even casting a look
[Page732-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>upon her, he hurried forward. But, she jumped down
<div n="lb"/>from her seat, blocked his path and made enquiries
<div n="lb"/>about him. She also tried to make love to him. But,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇuśarman turned down her overtures of love. At
<div n="lb"/>this stage Indra adopted many magical tricks to frighten
<div n="lb"/>away the unwelcome visitor. Angered by such attempts
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇuśarman got ready to destroy Devaloka along with
<div n="lb"/>Indra, who then begged pardon of him and handed
<div n="lb"/>over to him a pot full of nectar.
<div n="NI"/>When Viṣṇuśarman gave the nectar to his father the
<div n="lb"/>latter asked him to choose any boon he wanted, and
<div n="lb"/>according to his request the father brought back to life
<div n="lb"/>Guṇavatī. Now Śivaśarman very much pleased with his
<div n="lb"/>sons sent the first four of them to Viṣṇuloka. He decided
<div n="lb"/>to live for some time more on earth with his youngest son,
<div n="lb"/>and he told the latter that he was going on a pilgrimage
<div n="lb"/>and asked him to keep the pot of nectar with him. The
<div n="lb"/>son kept it very carefully for ten years. Now Śivaśarman
<div n="lb"/>with his wife returned from pilgrimage. By magic he
<div n="lb"/>had become a leper, and made his wife also a leper.
<div n="lb"/>Somaśarman, his youngest son felt pained that his
<div n="lb"/>parents had fallen victims to such a fell disease and
<div n="lb"/>served them with meticulous care in every way. He
<div n="lb"/>foresaw their wants and desires and satisfied them to the
<div n="lb"/>full. Yet, the father lost temper with the son and used
<div n="lb"/>even to fist him. But, the son did not lose his temper
<div n="lb"/>in any manner and to the least degree. He continued
<div n="lb"/>to serve his parents most cheerfully.
<div n="NI"/>A century was over in this manner. The parents were
<div n="lb"/>greatly satisfied and pleased with their son, and ulti-
<div n="lb"/>mately the father cast one more illusion on the son.
<div n="lb"/>After stealing away by magic the nectar from the pot,
<div n="lb"/>he asked the son for it. When Somaśarman looked into
<div n="lb"/>the pot for nectar, to his horror it was missing. But, he
<div n="lb"/>took the pot to his father saying to himself, ‘Let there
<div n="lb"/>be nectar in it if I am truthful, if I have served my
<div n="lb"/>elders well and if I have observed pure tapas’, and lo!
<div n="lb"/>the pot was filled with nectar.
<div n="NI"/>Śivaśarman blessed his son, and by the power of his
<div n="lb"/>yoga ascended to Vaikuṇṭha in the company of his wife.
<div n="lb"/>After this Somaśarman began practising the most in-
<div n="lb"/>tense form of tapas. When the time for his death was
<div n="lb"/>near asuras approached him. Fear about asuras gripped
<div n="lb"/>him, who was in deep meditation, and as he breathed
<div n="lb"/>his last thinking about asuras he was born in his next
<div n="lb"/>life as Prahlāda, son of Hiraṇyakaśipu and got killed by
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu in the war between Devas and Asuras. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Bhūmi Khaṇḍa).
