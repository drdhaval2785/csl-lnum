<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Rukmakavaca, grandfather of Lomapāda
<div n="lb"/>conquered many countries and gave them all as gifts to
<div n="lb"/>those brahmins who participated in his Aśvamedha-
<div n="lb"/>yajña. He got five brave sons, Rukmeṣu, Pṛthurukma,
<div n="lb"/>Jyāmagha, Parigha and Hari. Of them he made Parigha
<div n="lb"/>and Hari live and rule in Videha. Rukmeṣu ruled his
<div n="lb"/>father's country and Pṛthurukma helped his brother.
<div n="lb"/>Jyāmagha was sent out from his country and he lived
<div n="lb"/>quietly in a hermitage. One day as per the advice of a
<div n="lb"/>sage he left the place in a chariot with a flag flying
<div n="lb"/>to the shores of the river Narmadā. He had neither
<div n="lb"/>servants nor the means for his daily food. He lived on
<div n="lb"/>the mountain Ṛkṣavān eating only roots and fruits. He
<div n="lb"/>was very old and his wife Śaibyā also was getting old.
<div n="lb"/>They had no sons and still Jyāmagha did not marry
<div n="lb"/>again.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Jyāmagha gained a victory in a fight, he
<div n="lb"/>brought a girl and entrusted the child to his wife
<div n="lb"/>saying “This child is your daughter-in-law.” Śaibyā
<div n="lb"/>was surprised and enquired “How can that be when I
<div n="lb"/>have no son?” Jyāmagha replied, “She is to be the wife
<div n="lb"/>of a son who will be born to you soon.” By means of the
<div n="lb"/>hard penance of that girl, Śaibyā got a handsome son
<div n="lb"/>named Vidarbha. Vidarbha married her and got two
<div n="lb"/>wise sons, Kratha and Kaiśika and a third son Loma-
<div n="lb"/>pāda, who was righteous, virtuous and wise. All the
<div n="lb"/>three were great warriors also. Descending in order from
<div n="lb"/>Lomapāda came Babhru-Heti-Kaiśika-Cidi. From this
<div n="lb"/>Cidi came the Cedi dynasty of Kings. (Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa, Bhīṣmapulastya Saṃvāda).
