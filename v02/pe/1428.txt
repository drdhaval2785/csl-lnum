CAṆḌIKĀ¦. A terrific form of Pārvatī, who is worship-
<div n="lb"/>ped in temples under the name Caṇḍikādevī. The
<div n="lb"/>Devī's idol has twenty hands. In the hands on the right
<div n="lb"/>side are held Śūla (three-pronged weapons) sword,
<div n="lb"/>Vela (rod), Cakra, pāśa (rope), parigha (shield),
<div n="lb"/>āyudha, abhaya, ḍamaru and Śakti, while the hands
<div n="lb"/>on the left side hold nāgapāśa, small parigha, axe,
<div n="lb"/>Aṅkuśa (a long-hooked rod), pāśa, maṇi, flag, gadā,
<div n="lb"/>mirror and an iron cylindrical rod. There are also
<div n="lb"/>idols of Caṇḍikā with ten hands. At the feet of the
<div n="lb"/>Devī lies Mahiṣāsura with his head severed from body.
<div n="lb"/>There will also be standing near the idol a puruṣa (man)
<div n="lb"/>born from the neck of the Māhiṣa brandishing his wea-
<div n="lb"/>pon, and with the Śūla in his hand in all rage and
<div n="lb"/>vomiting blood and with red hairs and eyes. That
<div n="lb"/>puruṣa is bound strongly on his neck with rope. The
<div n="lb"/>vehicle of the Devī is a lion. The Devī is mounted on
<div n="lb"/>the lion with her left leg on the asura lying below. This
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍikādevī thus stands with weapons in the hand, as
<div n="lb"/>annihilator of enemies and with three eyes, and she
<div n="lb"/>should be worshipped in pūjāmaṇḍala with nine Padmas
<div n="lb"/>(tantric divisions) along with her idol. Firstly the Devī
<div n="lb"/>should be worshipped in the central padma and Indra
<div n="lb"/>and others in the other padmas.
<div n="NI"/>There is also another Caṇḍikādevī (Durgā) with eigh-
<div n="lb"/>teen hands. She holds in her right hand a skull, shield,
<div n="lb"/>mirror, broom, bow, flag, ḍamaru and pāśa (cord) and
<div n="lb"/>in her left hand rod, iron pounder, Śūla, Vajra, sword,
<div n="lb"/>Aṅkuśa (a sticklike weapon with one end bent to hold
<div n="lb"/>on to things) Śara (arrow) Cakra and śalākā. There
<div n="lb"/>are nine other Durgās having the same weapons as the
<div n="lb"/>above except the Ḍamaru and the broom. But, they
<div n="lb"/>have only sixteen hands each. These nine Durgās are
<div n="lb"/>called Rudracaṇḍā, Pracaṇḍā, Ugracaṇḍā, Caṇḍā-
<div n="lb"/>nāyikā, Aticaṇḍikā, and Caṇḍogrā. The Durgā standing
<div n="lb"/>at the centre will have the colour of gorocana (red
<div n="lb"/>sandal paste) and the others will have the following
<div n="lb"/>colours; aruṇavarṇa (red) Kṛṣṇa varṇa (black), nīla
<div n="lb"/>varṇa (blue), śukla varṇa (white), dhūmra varṇa
<div n="lb"/>(brown) pīta varṇa (yellow) and śveṭa varṇa (white).
<div n="lb"/>The nava Durgās (nine Durgās) are installed for the
<div n="lb"/>prosperity of children etc. And all these are different
<div n="lb"/>forms of Pārvatī.
<div n="NI"/>Also, in various aspects or poses, Pārvatī is called by
<div n="lb"/>other names. She is called Siddhā when installed in
<div n="lb"/>Raṃbhā-vana wearing akṣamālā (garland of beads),
<div n="lb"/>kirīṭa (crown) and agni. The same Siddhā without
<div n="lb"/>the fire is called Lalitā. Gaurīdevī with one of the
[Page171-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>hands on the left side placed on the shoulder and the
<div n="lb"/>head, and holding the mirror in the other hand, and
<div n="lb"/>holding in one of the hands on the right side fruits etc.
<div n="lb"/>and the other hand held up is called Saubhāgya gaurī.
<div n="lb"/>(For further details see Pārvatī). (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 50).
