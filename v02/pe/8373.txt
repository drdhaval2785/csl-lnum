VINĀYAKACATURTHĪ¦. One of the important festivals
<div n="lb"/>of the Hindus. This is called the day of worship of
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇeśa. The Caturthī (4th day) of the bright lunar
<div n="lb"/>fortnight in the month of Siṃha is the birth day of
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati. It is a famous festival in North India. They
<div n="lb"/>make the images of Gaṇapati, every year, and make
<div n="lb"/>offerings to them on this particular day.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed, that he who sees the moon on Vināyaka
<div n="lb"/>Caturthī, will be subjected to dishonour and derision.
<div n="lb"/>This belief is based on the following story.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇapati is very fond of sweetmeat especially Kozhuk-
<div n="lb"/>kaṭṭa (globular solid sweetmeat, called Modaka). It is
<div n="lb"/>the custom in North India to worship Gaṇapati by
<div n="lb"/>offering these sweetmeats, even today, with all kinds
<div n="lb"/>of festivities. On one birthday Gaṇapati went from house
<div n="lb"/>to house and ate belly-ful of modakas and returned
<div n="lb"/>home on his conveyance, the rat. On the way the rat
<div n="lb"/>saw a snake and began to tremble with fear. Due to
<div n="lb"/>the shivering of its legs Gaṇapati fell down. The belly
<div n="lb"/>of Gaṇapati was broken due to the fall and a large
<div n="lb"/>quantity of modakas came out. Gaṇapati gathered
<div n="lb"/>everything that fell out of his belly and stuffed them
<div n="lb"/>again in the stomach and joining the cut edges entwin-
<div n="lb"/>ed the snake tightly round the stomach. Candra who
<div n="lb"/>was standing in the sky seeing all these things laughed
<div n="lb"/>with contempt. At this, Gaṇapati got wild and plucked
<div n="lb"/>his tusk and throwing it at the moon cursed him. “Let
[Page857-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>nobody look at you on the Gaṇapati-festival day.”
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa). This story is slightly differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent according to Gaṇeśa Purāṇa. That story is, that
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Parameśvara gave a plum to his elder son
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya without the knowledge of his younger son
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati, on the 4th day of a bright lunar fortnight
<div n="lb"/>and the moon who smiled at it, was cursed.
