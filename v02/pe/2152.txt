DUḤKHA¦(M). Agni Purāṇa tells the following about
<div n="lb"/>the origin of Duḥkham.
<div n="NI"/>Hiṃsā (violence) is the wife of Adharma (unrighteous-
<div n="lb"/>ness). To the couple were born two daughters called
<div n="lb"/>Anṛta (falsehood) and Nikṛta (fraud) and from them
<div n="lb"/>were born the daughters Bhayā (fear) Naraka (hell)
<div n="lb"/>Māyā (illusion) and Vedanā (pain). Māyā brought
<div n="lb"/>forth Mṛtyu (death), the annihilator of all living
<div n="lb"/>objects, and Vedanā, from Raurava (a particular hell)
<div n="lb"/>brought forth Duḥkha (sorrow, grief). From Mṛtyu
<div n="lb"/>were born Jāti (caste), Jarā (wrinkles), Śoka (sorrow),
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṣṇā (covetouseness) and Krodha (anger). (Agni Pu-
<div n="lb"/>rāṇa, Chapter 19).
