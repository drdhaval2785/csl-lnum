SUBHADRĀ I¦. Sister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Subhadrā was the daughter of Vasudeva by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Devakī. She had two brothers, Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Sāraṇa and she was her father's pet child. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 217, Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Married to Arjuna.%} During his one year's pilgrimage
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, after visiting various holy places, came at last
<div n="lb"/>to Prabhāsa tīrtha in the plains of the western moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain. He met Gada there who described to him the
<div n="lb"/>unique beauty of Subhadrā. The description evoked
<div n="lb"/>in him the desire to marry her for which purpose he
<div n="lb"/>assumed the form of a Sannyāsin and sitting under a
<div n="lb"/>tree thought about Śrī Kṛṣṇa who understood the fact
<div n="lb"/>while lying on the bed with Satyabhāmā and immedia-
<div n="lb"/>tely he began laughing. Asked for the reason for his
<div n="lb"/>laughing thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa told her about Arjuna think-
<div n="lb"/>ing about him etc. Kṛṣṇa then went to Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>questioned him about the reason for his pilgrimage and
<div n="lb"/>the latter explained the circumstances of it. They then
<div n="lb"/>went to the Raivata mountain where Arjuna revealed
<div n="lb"/>to Kṛṣṇa his desire to marry Subhadrā. Kṛṣṇa agreed
<div n="lb"/>and, after leaving Arjuna at the mountain, returned to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>Within a few days the Yādavas celebrated a festival at
<div n="lb"/>Raivata attended by prominent leaders like Balabhadra,
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena, Pradyumna, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and others. The sight
<div n="lb"/>of Subhadrā among them evoked uncontrollable love in
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna who asked Kṛṣṇa secretly about the means for him
<div n="lb"/>to marry Subhadrā. Kṛṣṇa answered him thus: “Svayaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>vara (marriage by self choice by a woman) is ordained
<div n="lb"/>for Kṣatriyas. But, how would we know whom Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>loves. Abduction also is ordained for Kṣatriyas. So
<div n="lb"/>you abduct Subhadrā.”
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna immediately sent word about the matter through
<div n="lb"/>emissaries to Indraprastha. After the festival at Raivata
<div n="lb"/>was over, Subhadrā returned to Dvārakā. As for Arjuna,
<div n="lb"/>he sat on a rock in the forest thinking about Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>when Yādava heroes like Bala, Sāmba, Sāraṇa, Pradyu-
<div n="lb"/>mna and Gada came that way by chance. They saluted
<div n="lb"/>the Sannyāsin (Arjuna) and after blessing them he made
<div n="lb"/>them sit on the rock around him and related to them
<div n="lb"/>various stories. Then Yādavas felt great respect for the
<div n="lb"/>Sannyāsin and invited him and took him to Dvārakā.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and others arranged for the stay of the Sannyāsin,
<div n="lb"/>who pretended to spend Cāturmāsya there. He was to
<div n="lb"/>be fed from Subhadrā's house and the Sannyāsin was
<div n="lb"/>overwhelmed with joy.
<div n="NI"/>As days passed on thus, Arjuna grew more and more
<div n="lb"/>sick with love. Subhadrā felt unbounded affection for
<div n="lb"/>him. She heard from him many stories about the valiant
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍava, Arjuna. When he was convinced that Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>cherished strong love for him, Arjuna revealed the truth
<div n="lb"/>about him. When he told her that he, the fake Sannyāsin,
<div n="lb"/>was really Arjuna who was living there without the
<div n="lb"/>knowledge of his mother and brothers, Subhadrā bent
<div n="lb"/>down her head in shyness.
<div n="NI"/>Subhadrā's wedding was decided to be held on the
<div n="lb"/>twelfth day from that date. Balabhadra and Uddhava
<div n="lb"/>both of them short-tempered, were not informed about
<div n="lb"/>the decision. Śrī Kṛṣṇa took the lead in making prepar-
<div n="lb"/>ations for the wedding and he saw Subhadrā and gave
<div n="lb"/>her all good wishes.
[Page746-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Many of the Yādava chiefs wanted Subhadrā to be
<div n="lb"/>wedded to Duryodhana, a disciple of Balabhadra and
<div n="lb"/>against this desire of theirs Subhadrā and Arjuna to-
<div n="lb"/>gether drove themselves away in a chariot through lines
<div n="lb"/>of people and this created a stir among the Yādavas.
<div n="lb"/>But, Kṛṣṇa pacified them all. (Ādi Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>213-228; Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
