AŚVANADĪ¦. A river in the country of Kuntibhoja.
<div n="lb"/>Aśvanadī joins Carmaṇvatī and the latter joins the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā and the Yamunā joining Gaṅgā falls into the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. It was through this river that Kuntīdevī floated
<div n="lb"/>in a box the infant Karṇa. At night accompanied by
<div n="lb"/>her maid, Kunti floated the box containing her illegiti-
<div n="lb"/>mate son and stood on the banks of Aśvanadī weeping
<div n="lb"/>bitterly. Then thinking that her father would notice
<div n="lb"/>her absence from the palace she returned home soon.
<div n="lb"/>The box floated and reached the country, Campāpurī,
<div n="lb"/>ruled by a charioteer. (Ślokas 22 to 26, Chapter 308,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Parva, M.B.).
