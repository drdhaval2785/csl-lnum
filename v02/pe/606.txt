ATIBALA I¦. The Maharṣi Atibala was the cause of the
<div n="lb"/>death of Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>After the war with Rāvaṇa, Śrī Rāma returned to Ayo-
<div n="lb"/>dhyā with his retinue and began his reign. After re-
<div n="lb"/>nouncing Sītā while Śrī Rāma was living in the palace
<div n="lb"/>with Lakṣmaṇa, Śatrughna and their families, one day
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā summoned Yama and said: “Śrī Rāma is the
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. He has fulfilled all the pur-
<div n="lb"/>poses of the incarnation. Now Viṣṇu has to be recalled
<div n="lb"/>to Vaikuṇṭha”.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Yama assuming the guise of a Sanny-
<div n="lb"/>āsi named Atibala appeared before Śrī Rāma. He said
<div n="lb"/>he had to tell a secret to Śrī Rāma. Accordingly Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma sent everyone else out of the audience chamber.

<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa was asked to guard the entrance. It was
<div n="lb"/>announced that if anyone entered the hall, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>would be killed.
<div n="NI"/>At this stage, Maharṣi Durvāsas arrived at the entrance
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by many of his disciples. He had come
<div n="lb"/>after having performed penance for a thousand years
<div n="lb"/>and in great hunger and thirst. He wanted to see the
<div n="lb"/>King to ask for sumptuous food. Lakṣmaṇa requested
<div n="lb"/>him to wait a little but Durvāsas refused to do so. He
<div n="lb"/>even threatened that he would reduce all of them to
<div n="lb"/>ashes by his curse. Finding no alternative, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>entered the hall and informed Śrī Rāma of the situation.
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas was given a sumptuous meal. But for the ful-
<div n="lb"/>filment of the condition Lakṣmaṇa's death became neces-
<div n="lb"/>sary. Śrī Rāma cried with a broken heart. The honest
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa went alone to the Sarayū river and drowned
<div n="lb"/>himself in its depths. Soon after, Śrī Rāma entrusting
<div n="lb"/>the affairs of the state to others and in the presence of
<div n="lb"/>thousands of spectators plunged into the Sarayū river
<div n="lb"/>and renouncing his earthly life, returned to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
