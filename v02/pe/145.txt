AKṚTAVRAṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Akṛtavraṇa was a great sage of
<div n="lb"/>erudition and was a disciple of Paraśurāma. He is ex-
<div n="lb"/>tolled in the Purāṇas and it is said that Sūta who recited
<div n="lb"/>first the story of Mahābhārata to an assembly of sages in
<div n="lb"/>the forest of Naimiśa was a disciple of Akṛtavraṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Skandha 12 of Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he became a disciple of Paraśurāma.%} Para urāma
<div n="lb"/>was returning after obtaining arrows from Lord Śiva
<div n="lb"/>after pleasing him by fierce penance. He was walking
<div n="lb"/>briskly through the dense forests anxious to be at the side
<div n="lb"/>of his preceptors to get their blessings. As he passed a
<div n="lb"/>great cave he heard a moan and on getting to the site
<div n="lb"/>of the sound found a brahmin boy being attacked by a
<div n="lb"/>tiger. The tiger immediately fell dead by an arrow from
[Page022-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. Lo! the tiger turned into a gandharva
<div n="lb"/>freed now from a curse because of which he was for years
<div n="lb"/>living as a tiger. The gandharva bowed down respect-
<div n="lb"/>fully and thanked the sage for giving him relief and left
<div n="lb"/>the place. The brahmin boy fell down at the feet of
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma and said, “Great Lord, because of you I
<div n="lb"/>have now become Akṛtavraṇa meaning one who has not
<div n="lb"/>received any wound. (Akṛta=not having secured.
<div n="lb"/>Vraṇa=wound). I shall, therefore, be your disciple for-
<div n="lb"/>ever hereafter”. From that day onwards he never left
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma but followed him as his disciple.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) In the story of Mahābhārata we
<div n="lb"/>find Akṛtavraṇa in several different contexts appearing
<div n="lb"/>on behalf of Paraśurāma. It was Akṛtavraṇa who told
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra the life and exploits of Paraśurāma during
<div n="lb"/>the exile of the Pāṇḍavas in the forests. (Chapters 115 to
<div n="lb"/>117, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) In Chapter 83 of Udyoga Parva we read about
<div n="lb"/>Akṛtavraṇa meeting Śrī Kṛṣṇa while the latter was going
<div n="lb"/>to Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>(3) In Chapter 173 of Udyoga Parva we read about
<div n="lb"/>Akṛtavraṇa detailing the history of the Kaurava dynasty
<div n="lb"/>to Duryodhana.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Akṛtavraṇa has played a very important role in the
<div n="lb"/>story of Ambā, daughter of the King of Kāśī. Ambā
<div n="lb"/>along with her two sisters, Ambikā and Ambālikā, were
<div n="lb"/>brought down to Hastināpura by Bhīṣma for his brother
<div n="lb"/>Vicitravīrya to marry. But on knowing that Ambā had
<div n="lb"/>mentally chosen Sālva as her husband, Bhīṣma allowed
<div n="lb"/>her to go back to Sālva. But on her return to Sālva he
<div n="lb"/>refused to accept her and she came back to Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma then requested Vicitravīrya to accept her as
<div n="lb"/>his wife which, unfortunately, Vicitravīrya also refused
<div n="lb"/>to do. Ambā then turned to Bhīṣma and besought him
<div n="lb"/>to marry her which, much to his regret, he could not do
<div n="lb"/>because of his vow of celibacy. Thus forsaken by all,
<div n="lb"/>all her sweetness turned into bitter hatred towards
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma and she remained alive thereafter only to kill
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma. But even the foremost of warriors were not
<div n="lb"/>willing to antagonise Bhīṣma and so her appeal to help
<div n="lb"/>was not heeded by any. It was then that Hotravāha her
<div n="lb"/>grandfather on the maternal side met her and directed
<div n="lb"/>her to Paraśurāma. When she went to Paraśurāma it
<div n="lb"/>was Akṛtavraṇa who received her and on hearing her
<div n="lb"/>sorrowful tale encouraged her to seek vengeance on
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma. Again it was he who persuaded Paraśurāma to
<div n="lb"/>champion her cause and go for a fight against Bhīṣma.
<div n="lb"/>During the fight Akṛtavraṇa acted as charioteer to
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. (Śloka 9, Chapter 179, Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Akṛtavraṇa was one of the many sages who were
<div n="lb"/>lying on a bed of arrows during the great Kurukṣetra
<div n="lb"/>battle. (Śloka 8, Chapter 26, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
