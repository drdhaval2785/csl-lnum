AŚVAKṚTA¦. A river. Once a sage called Rcīka went to
<div n="lb"/>Gādhi and asked for the hand of his daughter, Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, in marriage. He demanded as dowry a thousand
<div n="lb"/>horses black in colour and with only one ear for each.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka prayed to Varuṇa and he gave him the horses
<div n="lb"/>required. The river Aśvakṛta (created by horse) was
<div n="lb"/>made by the flow of urine from these horses. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>57, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
