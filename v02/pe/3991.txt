LIKHITA II¦. An evil-natured priest of Haṃsadhvaja,
<div n="lb"/>the King of Campakapurī. Śaṅkha his brother also was
<div n="lb"/>the King's priest. Haṃsadhvaja blocked the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>horse of the Aśvamedha yajña of Dharmaputra and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna attacked the King to get the horse released. To
<div n="lb"/>mobilise an army the King announced that each and
<div n="lb"/>every soldier should assemble at the place by day-break
<div n="lb"/>the next morning and added that those who disobeyed
<div n="lb"/>would be put in burning oil.
<div n="NI"/>By early morning the next day all the soldiers excepting
<div n="lb"/>the son of the King arrived at the palace. Sudhanvā,
<div n="lb"/>the King's son, was a general of the army and his
<div n="lb"/>absence annoyed the King. Haṃsadhvaja was hesitat-
<div n="lb"/>ing whether his son should be punished when Likhita
<div n="lb"/>advised the King to execute the punishment.
<div n="NI"/>The King put Sudhanvā into a big cauldron of boiling
<div n="lb"/>oil but Sudhanvā escaped from it unscathed to the
<div n="lb"/>surprise of all. Likhita and Śaṅkha said that Sudhanvā
<div n="lb"/>escaped because the boiling of the oil was incomplete
<div n="lb"/>and uneven. So they boiled the oil again and threw
<div n="lb"/>Sudhanvā into it. At this moment a huge palm tree
<div n="lb"/>split into two and fell on them and they were killed.
<div n="lb"/>(Jaimini Aśvamedhaparva).
