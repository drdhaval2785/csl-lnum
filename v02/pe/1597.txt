CITRASENA I¦. A gandharva. There is reference to
<div n="lb"/>this gandharva in many places in the purāṇas. He had
<div n="lb"/>two wives Sandhyāvalī and Ratnāvalī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How Arjuna saved him.%} Once when Citrasena with
<div n="lb"/>his wives was travelling in the aerial car the spittings of
<div n="lb"/>Citrasena fell upon the sage Gālava who was doing his
<div n="lb"/>sandhyā rites then. The sage complained about the
<div n="lb"/>incident to Śrī Kṛṣṇa who promised to bring to him the
<div n="lb"/>head of Citrasena before sun-set. Sage Nārada informed
<div n="lb"/>Citrasena of this vow of Kṛṣṇa. The gandharva was
<div n="lb"/>taken aback and did not know what to do. But Sandhyā-
<div n="lb"/>valī and Ratnāvalī went and sought the help of Subhadrā.
<div n="lb"/>They made a fire pit in front of her house and decided
<div n="lb"/>to end their lives along with Citrasena by jumping into
<div n="lb"/>the fire. While Citrasena was circling the fire-pit be-
<div n="lb"/>fore jumping into it his wives wept loudly and hearing
<div n="lb"/>the noise Subhadrā came out and saw what was happen-
<div n="lb"/>ing. They then took from Subhadrā a boon to the effect
<div n="lb"/>that they should be allowed to live with their husband.
<div n="lb"/>It was only after granting them the boon that Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>understood the whole situation. Subhadrā was in a
<div n="lb"/>fix but Arjuna assured her that Citrasena would be
<div n="lb"/>protected at any cost. Arjuna very cleverly shielded all
<div n="lb"/>the arrows sent against the gandharva by Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>gradually the fight came to be one between Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Subhadrā came between them and it was
<div n="lb"/>found difficult to continue the fight. Śrī Kṛṣṇa advised
<div n="lb"/>Citrasena to bow down and touch the feet of Gālava.
<div n="lb"/>Citrasena obeyed and the issue settled without harm to
<div n="lb"/>both the parties.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Arjuna defeats Citrasena.%} While the Pāṇḍavas were
<div n="lb"/>in exile, Duryodhana knew through a spy that they
<div n="lb"/>were camping in the Dvaitavana forest. Prompted by
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa Duryodhana programmed to go to Dvaitavana
<div n="lb"/>with his retinue to enjoy the sight of the suffering Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas. So they started to the forests under a pretext of an
<div n="lb"/>annual stock-taking of the cows. They reached Dvaita-
<div n="lb"/>vana with a huge army. There they split into parties
<div n="lb"/>and roamed about making merry by themselves. Soon
<div n="lb"/>one of the parties reached a pond near the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. They saw a few gandharvas making
<div n="lb"/>merry in the pond. With the usual haughtiness they
<div n="lb"/>commanded the gandharvas to leave the pond and make
<div n="lb"/>room for Duryodhana to come and bathe. The gandhar-
<div n="lb"/>vas did not pay heed to their words and on being inform-
<div n="lb"/>ed of this Duryodhana went to fight with the gandhar-
<div n="lb"/>vas. It was Citrasena who led the gandharvas and by
<div n="lb"/>his incessant shower of piercing arrows split the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>forces and made them flee for life. Duryodhana was
<div n="lb"/>isolated from his army, was bound hand and foot and
<div n="lb"/>taken a prisoner. In their sheer helplessness they approa-
<div n="lb"/>ched Dharmaputra in his hermitage and acquainted
<div n="lb"/>him with the pitiable plight of Duryodhana. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra asked Arjuna to go to the help of the Kauravas.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna faced Citrasena in a grim combat. Citrasena
<div n="lb"/>then appeared in his real form and Arjuna knew that
<div n="lb"/>he was fighting a friend. Then at the request of Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>Citraratha released Duryodhana. (Chapters 239 to
<div n="lb"/>243, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) This gandharva occupied a seat
<div n="lb"/>in the court of Yudhiṣṭhira along with twentyseven other
[Page187-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>gandharvas and a few Apsarā maidens. (Śloka 32,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 4, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Citrasena is a member of the court of Kubera also.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 26, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Citrasena used to attend the court of Indra also
<div n="lb"/>at times. (Śloka 22, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) At the invitation of Indra Arjuna went to devaloka
<div n="lb"/>and Citrasena taught him dance and music. It was
<div n="lb"/>during this visit that Arjuna threw a cold blanket on the
<div n="lb"/>amorous approaches of Urvaśī and was consequently
<div n="lb"/>cursed by her to be an eunuch. It was through Citrasena
<div n="lb"/>that Indra sent word to Urvaśī to console Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>give relief from the curse. (Chapters 45 and 46, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
