JAYATSENA IV¦. A King who took the side of the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas. He was son of Jarāsandha. This King came
<div n="lb"/>with an akṣauhiṇī of army and helped the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>in the battle of Bhārata. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>16, Stanza 16). It is mentioned in Karṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Stanza 30 that this King was killed by
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu.
<F>1.) The Mahābhārata mentions two princes of Magadha, bearing the same name ‘Jayatsena’. The fathers of both of them happen
<div n="lb"/>to be Jarāsandhas. But it is said that after the death of the famous Jarāsandha his son Sahadeva became king. This Sahadeva, with his
<div n="lb"/>brother Jayatsena took the side of the Pāṇḍavas and fought against the Kauravas. Hence the King Jayatsena mentioned here must be the
<div n="lb"/>son of some other Jarāsandha of the Kingdom of Magadha.</F>
