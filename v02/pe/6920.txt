SUDARŚANA VIII¦. A Vidyādhara. Because of the curse
<div n="lb"/>of Aṅgiras, this Vidyādhara was changed into a moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain snake. That story occurs as follows in Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 9.
<div n="NI"/>While Sudarśana was playing about in the world of
<div n="lb"/>Gods with some Gandharva damsels, Angiras and some
<div n="lb"/>other hermits came by that way. Sudarśana ridiculed
[Page751-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>them. Aṅgiras became angry and changed him to a
<div n="lb"/>mountain snake by a curse. Sudarśana prayed for libera-
<div n="lb"/>tion from the curse. Aṅgiras said that in Dvāparayuga,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu would incarnate as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and when Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>trod upon him, he would regain his original form.”
<div n="NI"/>Sudarśana became a big snake and began life in
<div n="lb"/>Ambāḍi. Once the people of Ambāḍi went to Devī
<div n="lb"/>forest and worshipped Maheśvara. They spent the night
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of the river Kālindī. In the night the snake
<div n="lb"/>mentioned above, caught hold of the leg of Nandagopa.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the snake swallowing Nandagopa the rest of them
<div n="lb"/>crowded there and struck at the snake with burning
<div n="lb"/>faggots. But it was in vain. Finally Śrī Kṛṣṇa came, and
<div n="lb"/>gave the snake a thrash. Instantly Sudarśana got his old
<div n="lb"/>form. He went to the world of gods.
