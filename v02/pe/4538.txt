MITHU¦. A very valorous dānava. Once Bharata son of
<div n="lb"/>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa was making preparations for an Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of the river Sarasvatī with Upamanyu as
<div n="lb"/>his priest when Mithu came and took them both to
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla. Then Devāpi, son of Upamanyu, got his father
<div n="lb"/>and the King released from there by continuous worship
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva (Brahma Purāṇa—127. 56-57).
