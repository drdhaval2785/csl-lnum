RAMĀ¦. A synonym for Mahālakṣmī. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>in the eighth Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata as to how the
<div n="lb"/>name Ramā came to be attached to Lakṣmī.
<div n="NI"/>Revanta, the very handsome son of Sūrya one day came
<div n="lb"/>to Vaikuṇṭha mounted on his horse Uccaiśśravas
<div n="lb"/>to pay his respects to Mahāviṣṇu. Even Lakṣmīdevī
<div n="lb"/>stood aghast speechless for a very short time at the
<div n="lb"/>charm of Revanta changing her looks between him and
<div n="lb"/>his horse. Mahāviṣṇu did not at all like this and cursed
<div n="lb"/>that since Lakṣmī's eyes enjoyed the sight of some one
<div n="lb"/>she would come to be called Ramā also and that she
<div n="lb"/>would be born as a mare on earth.
