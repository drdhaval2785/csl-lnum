KĀLINDĪ¦ (YAMUNĀ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Kālindī alias Yamunā is one of the holy
<div n="lb"/>rivers in India. The presiding deity of the river is
<div n="lb"/>Kālindīdevī. Kālindī, the daughter of the sun has her
<div n="lb"/>source in Kalinda mountaiṇ, and hence the name
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī for the river. Kālindī joins the Gaṅgā at
<div n="lb"/>Prayāga, and this confluence of the two rivers is called
<div n="lb"/>Saṅgama, which is a sacred place.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Gave way for Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} As soon as Kṛṣṇa was born
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva stealthily removed the child to Ambāḍi. Due
<div n="lb"/>to heavy rains the Kālindī was overflowing, and Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>deva begged Kālindī for a passage, and the river gave
<div n="lb"/>way for Vasudeva to take Kṛṣṇa to Ambāḍi. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Balabhadra dragged Kālindī.%} Balabhadrarāma once
<div n="lb"/>stayed in Ambāḍi for two months. One day he was
<div n="lb"/>picnicking on the banks of Kālindī with the Gopīs.
<div n="lb"/>Under the influence of liquor he desired to play with
<div n="lb"/>his companions in the waters of Kālindī. He called
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī to his side, but the chaste Kālindī refused to
<div n="lb"/>oblige him. So he dragged her by his plough hooking
<div n="lb"/>her to it. In great fear Kālindī saluted him, and he
<div n="lb"/>enjoyed with the gopīs for some time on its waters.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kālindī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's wife.%} After Maya had built
<div n="lb"/>Indraprastha for the Pāṇḍavas, Śrī Kṛṣṇa spent a few
<div n="lb"/>days there with them. And, one day while Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna were strolling on the banks of Kālindī the latter
<div n="lb"/>saw there a beautiful woman performing penance and
<div n="lb"/>he approached her. She told Arjuna that the object
<div n="lb"/>of her penance was to get Kṛṣṇa as husband, and when
[Page375-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna passed on the information to Kṛṣṇa he took her
<div n="lb"/>in his chariot to Dvārakā and duly married her.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Soṅs of Kālindī.%} Ten sons, were born to Kālindī by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Haṃsa and his son in Kālindī.%} Once Kṛṣṇa attacked
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha and the son of his minister, Haṃsa, being
<div n="lb"/>told that his father had been killed, committed suicide
<div n="lb"/>by jumping into Kālindī. But, Haṃsa had not been
<div n="lb"/>killed, and when he returned from the battlefield and
<div n="lb"/>knew about the death of his son, he too jumped into
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī and committed suicide. (Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>7). {%Other information.%}

<div n="NI"/>(ii) The Pāṇḍavas, during their life in exile in the
