SṚṢṬI¦ (CREATION). The Indian theory of creation
<div n="lb"/>is given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Triguṇas%} (The three attributes). The base of the
<div n="lb"/>universe is the set of the three attributes. They are
<div n="lb"/>Sattva (purity), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia).
<div n="lb"/>Only things which could be seen, possess these three
<div n="lb"/>attributes. Things which could be seen are perishable.
<div n="lb"/>The indestructible could not be seen. Shape or form
<div n="lb"/>is an attribute. God has no form. So god is without
<div n="lb"/>attributes. The God devoid of attributes can be realised
<div n="lb"/>by knowledge, but cannot be seen with the ordinary
<div n="lb"/>eyes. The three attributes have a power each. Know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge is the power of Sattva, activity, the power of Rajas
<div n="lb"/>and reason the power of Tamas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The five elements.%} From the divine power of Tamas,
<div n="lb"/>five senses came into being, such as sound, touch, form,
<div n="lb"/>taste and smell. Sound is the attribute of ether; touch,
<div n="lb"/>the attribute of air; form, the attribute of fire; taste, the
<div n="lb"/>attribute of water; and smell, the attribute of earth.
<div n="lb"/>These are the minute senses or essentials. These five
<div n="lb"/>senses having the divine powers, joined together with
<div n="lb"/>the five minute essentials, make up the attribute of
<div n="lb"/>Tamas.
[Page739-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>From the attribute of Sattva having the power of
<div n="lb"/>knowledge, the ten essentials, such as air, the Sun,
<div n="lb"/>Pāśī (Varuṇa) two Aśvinī-gods, Candra (Moon),
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Rudra, Kṣetrajña and mind, came into being.
<div n="lb"/>From these essentials the formation of five matters took
<div n="lb"/>place. They are the five elements. When vigour
<div n="lb"/>enters the quintupled elements, egoism is given a form.
<div n="lb"/>This vigour with perceptible body is called Ādi Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa (Primordial Nārāyaṇa). Anyhow, quintupled
<div n="lb"/>elements will be bright with firm attributes. Ether has
<div n="lb"/>the attribute of sound only. Air has the attributes of
<div n="lb"/>sound and touch. Fire has the three attributes of sound,
<div n="lb"/>touch and form. Water has the four attributes of sound,
<div n="lb"/>touch, form and taste, and earth has the five attributes
<div n="lb"/>of sound, touch, form, taste and smell. The variegated
<div n="lb"/>expression of these five elements is called the universe.
<div n="lb"/>It is stated in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 3, that the
<div n="lb"/>number of species of living beings found in the universe
<div n="lb"/>is eightyfour lakhs.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The embodied three (Trinity).%} It has been mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the last section how the three attributes came into
<div n="lb"/>existence and how the five elements originated from the
<div n="lb"/>three attributes and how vigour or energy acted upon
<div n="lb"/>the five elements and Ādi Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu came into
<div n="lb"/>being. In this section the birth of the three divine figures
<div n="lb"/>is being dealt with.
<div n="NI"/>In the known beginning, on the surface of the wide
<div n="lb"/>waters, covering the universe made of the five elements,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu lay on a banyan tree, as a child. “Who am
<div n="lb"/>I? How was I made, and what for? What have I to
<div n="lb"/>do?”, and so on were the thoughts of the child. Ins-
<div n="lb"/>tantly a voice from the ether fell into his ears saying,
<div n="lb"/>“I am everything. There is nothing eternal except me.”
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu lay contemplating on the voice he heard,
<div n="lb"/>when Mahādevī appeared before Mahāviṣṇu and said
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“Lo! Mahāviṣṇu! Whenever the universe
<div n="lb"/>required creation, preservation and destruction, by the
<div n="lb"/>potentiality of the Omnipotence or the Brahman with
<div n="lb"/>no attributes, you too had taken origin. Understand
<div n="lb"/>that the Omnipotence is beyond attributes. We all are
<div n="lb"/>within the purview of attributes. Your attribute mainly
<div n="lb"/>is Sattva. From your navel, will be born Brahmā with
<div n="lb"/>Rajas as his main attribute and from the forehead of
<div n="lb"/>that Brahmā, Śiva with Tamas as his main attribute
<div n="lb"/>will be born. By the power of penance, Brahmā will
<div n="lb"/>acquire the power of creation and with the help of the
<div n="lb"/>attribute of rajas, he will create a world of the colour
<div n="lb"/>of blood. You will be the protector and preserver of
<div n="lb"/>that world, and at the end of the Kalpa (world-age)
<div n="lb"/>Śiva will destroy that world. I am that power of purity,
<div n="lb"/>which stands as help and assistance to you in creation.”
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly, Brahmā was born from the navel of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva was born from the forehead of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Creation. Sprouts, Animals and Humanity.%} After the
<div n="lb"/>birth of the Trinity, while Brahmā was contemplating
<div n="lb"/>on creation, some creations of the attribute of Tamas
<div n="lb"/>originated from him unknowingly. It was Avidyā
<div n="lb"/>(Ignorance), having inertia, desire, great desire, dark-
<div n="lb"/>ness and great darkness as its five branches. That god
<div n="lb"/>continued his contemplation. Then five kinds of immov-
<div n="lb"/>ables without the power of knowledge or brightness in
<div n="lb"/>and out alike, and with souls covered with darkness,
<div n="lb"/>originated. As these immovables are said to be promi-
<div n="lb"/>nent, the creation of them is called prominent creation.
[Page739-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>These are called Sprouts (Udbhids). Seeing that this
<div n="lb"/>creation was not sufficient, the god again sat in
<div n="lb"/>contemplation. This time animals having horizontal
<div n="lb"/>back bones and organs of sense were created. They
<div n="lb"/>were called tiryaksrotas, as they walked horizontally.
<div n="lb"/>They, such as cow etc. are having more of the attributes
<div n="lb"/>of darkness and less of knowledge. They traverse
<div n="lb"/>wrong paths due to lack of knowledge though they think
<div n="lb"/>otherwise. Egoism, pride and twentyeight kinds of
<div n="lb"/>incapacities are their qualities. Though they possess
<div n="lb"/>knowledge inwardly they do not know each other.
<div n="lb"/>Thinking that this creation also was not sufficient,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā again engaged himself in contemplation, and
<div n="lb"/>there came out another creation. It was called ‘Ūrddhva-
<div n="lb"/>srotas’ (flowing upwards). This third creation
<div n="lb"/>having the attribute mainly of Sattva moved in a lofty
<div n="lb"/>level. Those who were born in this creation, desired
<div n="lb"/>for comfort and pleasure and were with the light of
<div n="lb"/>knowledge inwardly and outwardly. When the third
<div n="lb"/>creation called Devasṛṣṭi (creation of gods) originated
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmā he grew happy and contented.
<div n="NI"/>Even after creating thus much, Brahmā did not feel
<div n="lb"/>satisfaction. So he made the creation of ‘Arvāksrotas’
<div n="lb"/>(moving downwards). The creatures of this group were
<div n="lb"/>having the attributes of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas in an
<div n="lb"/>advanced degree. So they are miserable and full of
<div n="lb"/>activity. They are human beings.
<div n="NI"/>Thus having completed the creation of Udbhids
<div n="lb"/>(Sprouts), Tiryaks (animals) and Arvāks (human beings)
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā passed on to the creation of heavenly beings.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1; Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Creation. Night, Day, Evening, Morning.%} After this
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā again sat in contemplation for water-creation
<div n="lb"/>which is the creation of Devas, Asuras, Pitṛs and
<div n="lb"/>Manuṣyas (Gods, Demons, the Manes and Man). As
<div n="lb"/>he was sitting in contemplation, the attribute of
<div n="lb"/>Tamas (inertia) advanced in him and the asuras
<div n="lb"/>(demons) were born from his loins. Then Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>discarded the figure of Tamas in him. That discarded
<div n="lb"/>figure of darkness became the night. Next, from the
<div n="lb"/>face of Brahmā, the Devas (gods) were born. They
<div n="lb"/>were having the attribute of Sattva (purity). Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>discarded that figure of purity also. That figure
<div n="lb"/>became the bright day. So the asuras are powerful in
<div n="lb"/>the night and the Devas are powerful in the day. After
<div n="lb"/>this, the manes were born from Brahmā. They were
<div n="lb"/>also discarded. They became the evening between the
<div n="lb"/>day and night. Then Brahmā assumed the figure
<div n="lb"/>having the attribute of Rajas. From this, man, who
<div n="lb"/>was having more of the attribute of rajas was born.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā discarded that figure also. It became a very
<div n="lb"/>shining thing which is called the Dawn. So men
<div n="lb"/>are powerful in the dawn and the manes are powerful
<div n="lb"/>in the evening. The four creations of Day, Night,
<div n="lb"/>Evening and the Dawn are considered to be the bodies
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Creation. Rākṣasas (Giants), Yakṣas (Demi-gods),%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Serpents, Devils, Gandharvas%} Brahmā again assumed
<div n="lb"/>another figure having the attribute of Rajas. Due to
<div n="lb"/>this Brahmā felt hungry. Along with hunger desire
<div n="lb"/>also grew in him. Then the Prajāpati (Lord of
<div n="lb"/>Emanation) sat in the darkness and created some
<div n="lb"/>creatures which were very hungry. Uncouth with
<div n="lb"/>plenty of hair on the face, they ran towards Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Of them those who said, ‘don't do so, save him’
[Page740-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>became Rākṣasas (giants). Those who said “We will
<div n="lb"/>eat him”, became Yakṣas, (demi-gods). Because of
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣaṇa (Bhakṣaṇa-Food), they got the name Yakṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Because of the dislike at seeing these creatures the
<div n="lb"/>hair had fallen from the head of Brahmā. They crept
<div n="lb"/>back again into his head. Because they did ‘sarpaṇa’
<div n="lb"/>(creeping up) they were called sarpas (serpents) and
<div n="lb"/>as they were ‘Hīna’ (fallen) they were called Ahis
<div n="lb"/>(serpents). After this the Lord of creation became
<div n="lb"/>very angry and created some creatures. Because of
<div n="lb"/>their colour which was a mingling of red and black,
<div n="lb"/>they were horrible and they became piśitāśanas (those
<div n="lb"/>who eat flesh). Then Brahmā began to sing and from
<div n="lb"/>his body the Gandharvas were born. Because they did
<div n="lb"/>‘dhayana’ (Appreciate) of ‘go’ (word) when they were
<div n="lb"/>born, they were called Gandharvas.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Creation. Birds, animals.%} After creating all these creat-
<div n="lb"/>ures, Brahmā created birds, from his ‘vayas’ (strength),
<div n="lb"/>as free agents, according to their actions in the previous
<div n="lb"/>lives. Then Brahmā created sheep from his breast and
<div n="lb"/>goats from his face. From his stomach and flanks he
<div n="lb"/>created cows, and from his legs he created other creat-
<div n="lb"/>ures such as the horse, elephant, donkey, wild bull, deer,
<div n="lb"/>camel, mule, antelope etc. He created plants bearing
<div n="lb"/>fruits and bulbs from his hairs. Though Brahmā had
<div n="lb"/>created vegetables and animals at the beginning of the
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa (world-age), they came to be properly used in
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices only from Tretāyuga (one of the four ages)
<div n="lb"/>The animals such as the cow, sheep, goat, horse, mule
<div n="lb"/>and donkey are called domestic animals and flesh-eaters
<div n="lb"/>such as the leopard, animals with forked hoof such as
<div n="lb"/>the wild bull, elephant, monkey, birds, and other
<div n="lb"/>animals and reptiles, are included in the word ‘wild
<div n="lb"/>animals’.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Creation-The Vedas etc.%} After having completed crea-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the things mentioned above, the Prajāpati created
<div n="lb"/>from his face looking to the east, the Vedic metre
<div n="lb"/>Gāyatrī, Ṛgveda, Trivṛtstoma, the sāma song called
<div n="lb"/>Rathantara and the sacrifice called Agniṣṭoma; from
<div n="lb"/>his face looking to the south, Yajurveda, the Vedic metre
<div n="lb"/>Traiṣṭubha, Pañcadaśa stoma. Bṛhatsāma and the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice Uktha; from his face looking to the west, Sāmaveda,
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic metre Jagatī, Saptadaśastoma, Vairūpasāma
<div n="lb"/>and the sacrifice Atirātra. Thus all the creatures lofty
<div n="lb"/>and lower originated from the body of Brahmā. After
<div n="lb"/>having created Devas, Asuras, the manes and men,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā again at the beginning of the world age, created
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas, Devils, Gandharvas, celestial maids, Naras,
<div n="lb"/>Kinnaras, Rakṣas, cows, birds, animals, serpents etc.
<div n="lb"/>such as have long life and short life, movable and immo-
<div n="lb"/>vable, that we see in the world. Creatures which are
<div n="lb"/>created again and again do perform functions which
<div n="lb"/>creatures of their kind had been doing previously.
<div n="lb"/>Habits of killing or not killing, kindness or cruelty,
<div n="lb"/>righteousness or evil, truth or falsehood are adopted by
<div n="lb"/>them as becoming to their kind in previous lives. It was
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā who had created the uses and differences seen
<div n="lb"/>in the sense organs, elements and bodies. Brahmā took
<div n="lb"/>from the Vedic voice the shape, form, name, activities
<div n="lb"/>etc. of various creatures such as the Devas etc. and
<div n="lb"/>allotted them to each particular kind. So also he allotted
<div n="lb"/>names, work etc. to hermits as seen in the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Creation of the four castes.%} See under Cāturvarṇya.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Creation of Prajāpatis.%} When Brahmā saw that the
<div n="lb"/>subjects he had created, did not flourish, he created first
[Page740-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the Sanaka brothers and the mental sons of Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Aṅgiras, Marīci, Dakṣa, Atri
<div n="lb"/>and Vasiṣṭha, and gave these nine the name Prajāpatis
<div n="lb"/>(Lords of Emanation). Then he created nine women
<div n="lb"/>named Khyāti, Bhūti, Sambhūti, Kṣamā, Prīti, Sannati,
<div n="lb"/>Ūrjā, Anasūyā. and Prasūti and gave in marriage
<div n="lb"/>Khyāti to Bhṛgu, Bhūti to Pulastya, Sambhūti to Pulaha,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣamā to Kratu, Prīti to Aṅgiras, Sannati to Marīci,
<div n="lb"/>Ūrjā to Dakṣa, Anasūyā to Atri and Prasūti to Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>The great hermits such as Sanandana and the others
<div n="lb"/>created before the Prajāpatis, were not desirous of pro-
<div n="lb"/>pagation as they were wise sages who had renounced
<div n="lb"/>all attachments and who had been indifferent. When
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā saw that they were not mindful about produc-
<div n="lb"/>ing subjects he grew angry. (It was from the middle of
<div n="lb"/>the eye brows which were curved by his fury, that Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>one of the three divine figures was born). After this,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appointed Svāyambhuva, who originated from
<div n="lb"/>himself, and was of the same shape, as the first Manu
<div n="lb"/>for the protection of the subjects. This divine Manu
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva took his sister Śatarūpā as wife. Two
<div n="lb"/>sons named Priyavrata and Uttānapāda and two
<div n="lb"/>daughters named Prasūti and Ākūti were born to them.
<div n="lb"/>Of the two daughters Prasūti was given to Prajāpati
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa and Ākūti to Prajāpati Ruci. A son named
<div n="lb"/>Yajña and a daughter named Dakṣiṇā were born as
<div n="lb"/>twins to Prajāpati Ruci. Twelve sons were born to
<div n="lb"/>Yajña by Dakṣiṇā. They were devas named the Yamas
<div n="lb"/>of the Manvantara of Svāyambhuva. Dakṣa begot
<div n="lb"/>twentyfour daughters of Prasūti. They were Śraddhā,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī, Dhṛti, Tuṣṭi, Medhā, Puṣṭi, Kriyā, Buddhi,
<div n="lb"/>Lajjā, Vapus, Śānti, Siddhi, Kīrti, Khyāti, Satī, Sam-
<div n="lb"/>bhūti, Smṛti, Prīti, Kṣamā, Santati, Anasūyā, Ūrjā,
<div n="lb"/>Svāhā and Svadhā. Of these the first thirteen
<div n="lb"/>were given to Dharmadeva as wives. Of the remaining
<div n="lb"/>daughters, Khyāti became the wife of Bhṛgu, Satī, the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Śiva, Sambhūti of Marīci, Smṛti, of Aṅgiras,
<div n="lb"/>Prīti of Pulastya, Kṣamā of Pulaha, Santati of Kratu,
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā of Atri, Ūrjā of Vasiṣṭha, Svāhā of Agni, and
<div n="lb"/>Svadhā of the manes. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1; Chapter
<div n="lb"/>7).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%The children of the Prajāpatis.%} To Prajāpati Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī who became the wife of Viṣṇu and two sons
<div n="lb"/>named Dhātā and Vidhātā were born by Khyāti. These
<div n="lb"/>two married Āyati and Niyati the two daughters of
<div n="lb"/>Meru. To the two couples two sons named Prāṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Mṛkaṇḍu were born. From Mṛkaṇḍu, Mārkaṇḍeya was
<div n="lb"/>born, and from Mārkaṇḍeya, Vedaśiras was born. To
<div n="lb"/>Prāṇa a son named Dyutimān and to him a son named
<div n="lb"/>Rājavān was born. From this Rājavān the Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>dynasty grew up.
<div n="NI"/>Sambhūti the wife of Marīci gave birth to a son named
<div n="lb"/>Paurṇamāsa. To Aṅgiras four daughters named
<div n="lb"/>Sinīvālī, Kuhū, Rākā and Anumati were born by Smṛti.
<div n="lb"/>Three sinless sons named Candra, Durvāsas and
<div n="lb"/>Dattātreya were born to Atri by Anasūyā. Of them
<div n="lb"/>Dattātreya was a hermit. A son named Dattoli was
<div n="lb"/>born to Pulastya by Pratīti (Prīti). That Dattoli was the
<div n="lb"/>Agastya of Svāyambhuva Manvantara. Kṣamā the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Pulaha gave birth to three sons named Kardama,
<div n="lb"/>Urvarīyān and Sahiṣṇu. Santati the wife of Kratu, gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to sixty thousand hermits called Bālakhilyas.
<div n="lb"/>Seven sons named Rajas, Gotra, Ūrdhvabāhu, Savana,
<div n="lb"/>Anagha, Sutapas and Śukra were born to Vasiṣṭha by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Ūrjā. These sons were the seven hermits of
[Page741-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the third Manvantara. Three bright sons Pāvaka
<div n="lb"/>Pavamāna and Śuci were born to god Agni (fire) by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Svāhā. Fortyfive sons were born to them. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Creation—Living things.%} Creations of Sprouts, ani-
<div n="lb"/>mals, Men, Devas, Dānavas and so on have been dealt
<div n="lb"/>with. But all these creations were pertaining to the
<div n="lb"/>world of gods only. Sprouts and animals were born in
<div n="lb"/>the earth only from Prajāpati Kaśyapa, the son of
<div n="lb"/>Marīci.
<div n="NI"/>Prajāpati Kaśyapa married Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā,
<div n="lb"/>Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu and Analā, the eight
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa. From Aditi, the Devas, Ādityas,
<div n="lb"/>Vasus and the Rudras were born. Daityas were born
<div n="lb"/>from Diti and Dānavas from Danu. The asuras Naraka
<div n="lb"/>and Kāla were born to Kālikā. Five daughters named
<div n="lb"/>Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī were born
<div n="lb"/>to Tāmrā. Owls were born from Krauñcī. Bhāsī gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to the Bhāsas. Hawks and Vultures were born from
<div n="lb"/>Śyenī; Swans, geese and ruddy geese were born from
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭrī. Natā was born from Śukī and Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>was born from Natā. Ten daughters named Mṛgī,
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgamandā, Harī, Bhadramatā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī
<div n="lb"/>Śvetā, Surabhi, Surasā and Kadrū, were born to
<div n="lb"/>Krodhavaśā. Mṛgī gave birth to animals. From
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgamandā, bears, young deer and Bos grunniens were
<div n="lb"/>born. Lions and monkeys were the sons of Harī. A
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Irāvatī was born to Bhadramatā.
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata was the son of Irāvatī. Elephants were born from
<div n="lb"/>Mātaṅgī. Tigers were born from Śārdūlī. The eight ele-
<div n="lb"/>phants supporting the globe were born from Śvetā. Two
<div n="lb"/>daughters named Rohiṇī and Gandharvī were born to
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi. Cattle were born from Rohiṇī, and horses
<div n="lb"/>were born from Gandharvī. Surasā gave birth to
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas (serpents) and Kadrū gave birth to Uragas
<div n="lb"/>(reptiles). Men were born from Manu. The trees were
<div n="lb"/>born from Analā. Garuḍa and Aruṇa were born from
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā. Sampāti and Jaṭāyu were the sons of Aruṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sarga 14).
<div n="NI"/>(Facts about creation seen in various Purāṇas do not
<div n="lb"/>agree with each other. This essay is based on facts
<div n="lb"/>gathered from various Purāṇas. So disagreements may
<div n="lb"/>occur in it.)
