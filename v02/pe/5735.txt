REVANTA¦. A son of the sun.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The sun married the daughter of Viśvakarmā
<div n="lb"/>named Saṃjñā. She gave birth to three children named
<div n="lb"/>Manu, Yama and Yamī. Once, being unable to bear
<div n="lb"/>the radiance of her husband, Saṃjñā went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>to do penance. During this period Chāyā the maid of
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā attended on the sun. Three children, Śanaiścara,
<div n="lb"/>Manu and Tapatī were born to the Sun of Chāyā.
<div n="lb"/>Once Chāyā cursed Yama. Then only did the Sun
<div n="lb"/>remember about Saṃjñā. At that time Saṃjñā had been
<div n="lb"/>doing penance in the forest in the form of a mare. The
<div n="lb"/>Sun took the form of a horse and lived with her in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. From this union Aśvinīkumāras and also the last
<div n="lb"/>son Revanta were born. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>2).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Lakṣmī astounded at the sight of Revanta.%} For the story
<div n="lb"/>of how Lakṣmī was astounded at the sight of Revanta's
<div n="lb"/>handsome figure and how Mahāviṣṇu cursed Lakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>consequently, see under Ekavīra.
