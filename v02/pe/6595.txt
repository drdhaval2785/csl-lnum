ŚIKHIDHVAJA¦. A king, who ruled over Mālava during
<div n="lb"/>the first Dvāparayuga in the seventh Manvantara.
<div n="lb"/>Cūḍālā, daughter of the king of Saurāṣṭra was Śikhidh-
<div n="lb"/>vaja's wife. The Jñānavāsiṣṭham contains a story about
<div n="lb"/>how the royal couple renounced all attachments in life
<div n="lb"/>as the result of intense tapas.
<div n="NI"/>Śikhidhvaja and Cūḍālā began practising jñānayoga
<div n="lb"/>(communion through knowledge). It was Cūḍālā, who
<div n="lb"/>gained Siddhis first. Though the king was pleased with
<div n="lb"/>the achievements of his wife he felt sorry about his
<div n="lb"/>failure or drawbacks. Cūḍālā had attained the Siddhi to
<div n="lb"/>travel even in air. Though she told her husband empha-
[Page717-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>tically that he could practise jñānayoga living in the
<div n="lb"/>palace itself, he quitted the city for the forest and began
<div n="lb"/>performing tapas there. Then on one day, she went
<div n="lb"/>to the presence of the king in the forest in the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy and stood there without touching the earth
<div n="lb"/>with his feet. The king treated the boy with honour
<div n="lb"/>and respect taking him for some Deva. Then she reveal-
<div n="lb"/>ed her actual form, and the king agreed to return with
<div n="lb"/>her to the palace and practise jñānayoga there. At that
<div n="lb"/>juncture Cūḍālā created by her soul-power celestial
<div n="lb"/>women like Urvaśī and also Indra and lined them up
<div n="lb"/>before her husband. This was to test whether the king
<div n="lb"/>yielded to any of the temptations by the celestial
<div n="lb"/>women or by Indra and Cūḍālā returned with the king
<div n="lb"/>to the kingdom.
