HAṂSADHVAJA¦. A King of Campānagarī, who
<div n="lb"/>was a great devotee of Viṣṇu. During his reign
[Page307-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>monogamy prevailed in the country. He took the
<div n="lb"/>yājñic horse of Yudhiṣṭhira captive, and in the fight to
<div n="lb"/>release the horse Arjuna killed Sudhanvā and Suratha,
<div n="lb"/>sons of Haṃsadhvaja. Grieved and enraged at their
<div n="lb"/>death Haṃsadhvaja took the field against Arjuna, and
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa finding that Arjuna's life was in danger
<div n="lb"/>pacified them both. Also Kṛṣṇa requested Haṃsadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>to be a supporter of Arjuna in future. Haṃsadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>had five sons called Suratha, Sudhanvā, Sudarśa,
<div n="lb"/>Subala and Sama. (Jaimini, Aśvamedha Parva, 17,
<div n="lb"/>21).
