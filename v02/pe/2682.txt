HIRAṆYA¦. (Hiraṇyakaśipu, Hiraṇyākṣa)
[Page314-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Owing to a curse Jaya and Vijaya who were
<div n="lb"/>gate-keepers at Vaikuṇṭha were born as two asuras,
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa (elder brother) and Hiraṇyakaśipu (youn-
<div n="lb"/>ger brother). These brothers are known also as the
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyas. (See Jayavijayas).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Three sons called Hiraṇyākṣa, Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>and Vajrāṅga and a daughter, Siṃhikā were born to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapaprajāpati by his wife Diti. To Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>were born four sons called Anuhlāda, Hlāda Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>and Saṃhlāda. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>There is yet another story relating to the birth of these
<div n="lb"/>asuras. Though the other wives of Kaśyapa became
<div n="lb"/>mothers Diti alone was not blessed with a child for a
<div n="lb"/>long time. One day at dusk while Kaśyapa was immers-
<div n="lb"/>ed in meditation Diti rushed into his room and began
<div n="lb"/>lamenting and complaining about her having not yet
<div n="lb"/>been made a mother, and urgently asked Kaśyapa to
<div n="lb"/>make her one. But, Kaśyapa pointed out that it was
<div n="lb"/>not the proper time for such things. It was dusk when
<div n="lb"/>Śiva with his attendants would be out sight-seeing
<div n="lb"/>covered with ashes from burning ghats spread all around
<div n="lb"/>by storms. So Kaśyapa wanted to wait for some time
<div n="lb"/>more. But, she was not in a mood to pay heed to his
<div n="lb"/>advice and Kaśyapa had to yield to her proposal. After
<div n="lb"/>obliging her, once again he took his bath and began
<div n="lb"/>meditation.
<div n="NI"/>Diti became pregnant. She also got alarmed about the
<div n="lb"/>indiscretion committed at dusk time that day and,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa told her: “Your mind became impure, you
<div n="lb"/>did not obey me, you insulted the Devas also. There
<div n="lb"/>are two kids of a very low type in your womb. They
<div n="lb"/>will oppress the three worlds and kill innocent people.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu will never tolerate such things. He will
<div n="lb"/>incarnate himself to kill them. But since you feel peni-
<div n="lb"/>tent now, a grand-son of yours will become liked by all
<div n="lb"/>good people, and he will be a great devotee of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. (This was Prahlāda).
<div n="NI"/>At any rate, one hundred years after her getting preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant Diti delivered twin sons. The first born was named
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa and the next one Hiraṇyakaśipu. (Accor-
<div n="lb"/>ding to certain Purāṇas Hiraṇyakaśipu was the first
<div n="lb"/>born).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Hiraṇyākṣa.%} The boys grew up to become a growing
<div n="lb"/>menace to the whole world. Hiraṇyākṣa toured all the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds with a club. He besieged svarga. Devas ran
<div n="lb"/>away in fear. Hiraṇyākṣa, shaking his club, jumped
<div n="lb"/>from the sky into the sea and engaged himself in the
<div n="lb"/>sport of thrashing the waves with his club. Years passed
<div n="lb"/>by like this, and at last he went to Vibhāvarī, the capi-
<div n="lb"/>tal of Varuṇa and challenged him to fight. Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>came out of the palace, admitted his incapacity to fight
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa, and suggested to him to challenge Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. Accordingly he set out in search of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>It was during this period of time that the earth got engulf-
<div n="lb"/>ed in water. Svāyambhuvamanu requested his father,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā to raise up the earth from water. But, nowhere
<div n="lb"/>could be seen the earth, everywhere it was only a vast
<div n="lb"/>expanse of water. Brahmā then meditated upon Mahā
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu, who came out through Brahmā's nose in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a tiny boar. It grew up into a very big boar within
<div n="lb"/>no time, and jumped from the sky into the ocean, and
<div n="lb"/>within a few minutes it picked up from under the
<div n="lb"/>ocean the earth on its tusks and appeared on the surface
<div n="lb"/>of the water. Hiraṇyākṣa understood that the boar,
<div n="lb"/>which without the least fear picked up the earth from
[Page314-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla was none other than Mahāvisṇu and he chal-
<div n="lb"/>lenged Viṣṇu to fight. After replacing the earth in its
<div n="lb"/>old position Viṣṇu fought with Hiraṇyākṣa and killed
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Hiraṇyakaśipu.%} With the killing of his brother,
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu's hatred and enmity towards Viṣṇu in-
<div n="lb"/>creased very much. He, by doing tapas for very long
<div n="lb"/>years, secured boons from Brahmā and conquered the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds and ruled them as Triloka Cakravarti
<div n="lb"/>(Emperor of the three worlds). He prohibited through-
<div n="lb"/>out the empire not only the chanting of Viṣṇu's name,
<div n="lb"/>but even thinking about him (Viṣṇu) by his subjects.
<div n="lb"/>“Hiraṇyāya namaḥ” (salutations to Hiraṇya) replaced
<div n="lb"/>the old custom of chanting ‘Nārāyaṇāya namaḥ’ (salu-
<div n="lb"/>tations to Nārāyaṇa). Meantime, a son called Prahlāda,
<div n="lb"/>a great devotee of Mahāviṣṇu was born to Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu. (For the story of Hiraṇyakaśipu's death see
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda). (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa; Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapter 20).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Story about the name Hiraṇyakaśipu.%} Sage Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>once conducted an Aśvamedha yajña. A golden seat
<div n="lb"/>was put up there for the great sages who came to parti-
<div n="lb"/>cipate in the yajña. Diti was pregnant during the time
<div n="lb"/>of the yajña, and while it was duly progressing she one
<div n="lb"/>day came and sat on the above-mentioned golden seat,
<div n="lb"/>and very shortly she delivered a child. As the child was
<div n="lb"/>delivered on the golden seat the child came to be called
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, 8, 5, 7-12; Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa 67, 69).
