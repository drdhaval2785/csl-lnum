AMĀVASU II¦. One of the Pitṛs. Once Acchodā was
<div n="lb"/>fascinated by the physical charm of this Amāvasu and
<div n="lb"/>made advances of love to him. Amāvasu repelled her
<div n="lb"/>advances. On account of this impropriety of Acchodā,
<div n="lb"/>who was a spiritual daughter of the Pitṛs, she was de-
<div n="lb"/>graded and in her next birth was born as Kālī or
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa).
