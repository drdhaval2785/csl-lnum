PRAYĀGA¦. A sacred place situated at the meeting point
<div n="lb"/>of Gaṅgā and Yamunā. He who bathes at this holy
<div n="lb"/>spot would get the benefit of doing ten aśvamedhas.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 35, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that at Prayāga there is the presence of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, devatās, dikpālakas (guardians of the quarters),
<div n="lb"/>lokapālakas (guardians of the world), Sādhyas (realised
<div n="lb"/>souls), Pitṛs (manes), Maharṣis like Sanatkumāra, Aṅgiras,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmarṣis, Nāgas, Garuḍa, Siddhas, Sūryadeva and
[Page606-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. There are three fire-pits there. The river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā runs through the centre of these pits. The
<div n="lb"/>Centre of the confluence of Gaṅgā and Yamunā is be-
<div n="lb"/>lieved to be the waist of the world. There is at Prayāga
<div n="lb"/>the world-famous Triveṇī confluence. If one bathes at
<div n="lb"/>that place one gets the benefit of Aśvamedha and Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>sūya together.
<div n="NI"/>The greatness of Prayāga is described thus: Prayāga-
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha, Pratiṣṭhānatīrtha, Kambalatīrtha, Aśvataratīrtha,
<div n="lb"/>and Bhogavatītīrtha are said to be the Yāgavedīs of
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati. At such a Prayāga Vedas and Yajñas live
<div n="lb"/>personified. If one praises it or chants its name in
<div n="lb"/>songs or smears the mud from it on one's body, one
<div n="lb"/>would be absolved of all sins. If one gives away any-
<div n="lb"/>thing in charity at this place or conducts Śrāddha
<div n="lb"/>(ceremony of giving offerings to deceased relatives) or
<div n="lb"/>does pious mutterings one would get benefits of an
<div n="lb"/>imperishable nature. There are about seventy thousand
<div n="lb"/>tīrthas in this world, ten thousand of one kind and sixty
<div n="lb"/>thousand of another kind. Prayāga has the presence of
<div n="lb"/>all these tīrthas and so it is considered as the best of all
<div n="lb"/>tīrthas. Here is the Bhogavatītīrtha of Vāsuki and the tīrtha
<div n="lb"/>called Haṃsaprapatana. If one bathes in the ponds
<div n="lb"/>there for three days together one would get the credit
<div n="lb"/>of giving as charity a crore of cows. The three impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant places are the Gaṅgādvāra, Prayāga and Gaṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>sāgarasaṅgama. Chapter 211, Agni Purāṇa).
