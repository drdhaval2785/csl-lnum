<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Duṣyanta was once hunting in the forests when
<div n="lb"/>he hit a fawn with his arrow. The fawn fled to the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama of Kaṇva Muni and the king followed it. On
<div n="lb"/>reaching the Āśrama grounds he saw Śakuntalā water-
<div n="lb"/>ing the plants helped by her companions Anasūya and
<div n="lb"/>Priyaṃvadā. Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>each other at first sight. Kaṇva was absent from the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama and they married according to the Gāndharva
<div n="lb"/>rites and Śakuntalā became pregnant soon. The king
<div n="lb"/>gave her his signet ring as a sign of faith and left for
<div n="lb"/>his palace. When Duṣyanta left her Śakuntalā fell into
<div n="lb"/>a deep reverie and she never knew about the arrival of
<div n="lb"/>the arrogant sage, Durvāsas to the āśrama. Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>mistook her as disrespectful and cursed her saying that
<div n="lb"/>she would be forgotten by the man of whom she was
<div n="lb"/>thinking then. Śakuntalā never knew about the curse
<div n="lb"/>also.

<div n="NI"/>Kaṇva Muni when he returned to the Āśrama and knew
<div n="lb"/>everything, sent Śakuntalā to the palace of Duṣyanta.
<div n="lb"/>But King Duṣyanta never recognised her and when
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā was returning deeply grieved Menakā her
<div n="lb"/>mother, took her and left her in the āśrama of Kaśyapa.
<div n="lb"/>There Śakuntalā delivered a son. The boy grew brave
<div n="lb"/>and fearless and he could subdue even the wildest of
<div n="lb"/>animals around there. Kaśyapa, therefore, named him
<div n="lb"/>Sarvadamana.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Duṣyanta was returning home after visiting
<div n="lb"/>Indra he saw Śakuntalā, recognised her, and took her
<div n="lb"/>and the boy to his palace. This was the boy who later
<div n="lb"/>on became known as Bharata. (Chapter 73, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage and reign.%} Bharata was a partial incarna-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Mahāviṣṇu. Even while he was young he became
<div n="lb"/>a ruler and conquering the world destroyed the wicked.
<div n="lb"/>Bharata had three wives. All the sons born to them
<div n="lb"/>were bad and so the mothers killed them all. Aggrieved
<div n="lb"/>over the loss of his sons he worshipped the devas to
<div n="lb"/>get a son for him. At that time the great preceptor
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati forcibly married Mamatā the wife of his
<div n="lb"/>brother. Mamatā was pregnant then and when she
<div n="lb"/>conceived from Bṛhaspati also she bore two children.
<div n="lb"/>On delivery she threw the child of Bṛhaspati in the
<div n="lb"/>forests and went away with the other son.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas took care of the discarded child and named
<div n="lb"/>him Bharadvāja and gave the child to Bharata. Bharata
<div n="lb"/>gave the boy the name Vitatha (Dīrghatamas). Bharata
<div n="lb"/>ruled over his land for twentyseven thousand years and
<div n="lb"/>the land was, therefore, called Bhārata. (Śloka 96,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>After ruling the land ideally he left for the forests
<div n="lb"/>entrusting the land to his son, Vitatha. (Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Vitatha also was called Bharata and he had five sons:
<div n="lb"/>Suhotra, Suhota, Gaya, Garbha and Suketu. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>278, Agni Purāṇa).
