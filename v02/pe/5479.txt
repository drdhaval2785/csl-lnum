PUÑJIKASTHALĀ¦. A nymph. She was the servant-
<div n="lb"/>maid of Bṛhaspati. One day she was collecting flowers
<div n="lb"/>for her Guru in a garden when a set of young men
<div n="lb"/>and women came to the garden for amorous sports.
<div n="lb"/>They were roaming about in the garden in pairs doing
<div n="lb"/>all sorts of erotic acts and Puñjikasthalā stood watching
<div n="lb"/>them for some time with passion aroused in her. She
<div n="lb"/>returned to the āśrama thinking all the way about her
<div n="lb"/>miserable lot of having no husband to enjoy a similar
<div n="lb"/>life. She was full of lust when she returned to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama and on seeing Bṛhaspati she caught hold of him
<div n="lb"/>by the hand and pleaded to satisfy her passion.
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati was angry at this improper request and
<div n="lb"/>cursed her “You have become rotten. You have be-
<div n="lb"/>come lustful by seeing the amorous sports of others.
<div n="lb"/>May you be born as a monkey. Get out of this āśrama.”
<div n="lb"/>Puñjikasthalā came to her senses and regretting her
<div n="lb"/>hasty act begged her Guru to grant her release from
<div n="lb"/>the curse. Bṛhaspati felt pity on her and said “Go and
<div n="lb"/>enjoy to your full sexual life with a lover whom you
<div n="lb"/>like best. Then you will get a son from the vitality of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. When that son is born you will be released from
<div n="lb"/>the curse and you will go to heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>She became immediately a monkey girl named Añjanā
<div n="lb"/>and started living in a forest of that name itself. She
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with a monkey boy named Kesarī there and
<div n="lb"/>lived for many years enjoying an amorous life. She did
<div n="lb"/>not get a child even after several years and then she
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Śiva for a child.
<div n="NI"/>It was at that time that Pārvatī and Parameśvara
<div n="lb"/>played amorous sports in the form of monkeys and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī became pregnant. Pārvatī expressed reluctance
<div n="lb"/>to be the mother of a monkey child and then Śiva by
<div n="lb"/>his divine powers deposited his semen virile through
<div n="lb"/>Vāyubhagavān (god of wind) into the womb of
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā who was then praying to him for a child.
<div n="lb"/>Coming to know of this through Nārada and fearing
<div n="lb"/>that his lordship over the monkeys would be lost if
<div n="lb"/>such a monkey were born to Añjanā Bāli poured into
<div n="lb"/>the belly of Añjanā molten liquid of pañcaloha (five
<div n="lb"/>metals). Añjanā was not the least injured and she
<div n="lb"/>gave birth in due course to a monkey son who became
<div n="lb"/>the celebrated Hanūmān, the life-force of the Rāma-
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa tussle. (Pūrvakāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa;
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>This Puñjikasthalā belongs to the famous set of eleven
<div n="lb"/>devakanyakās. They are: Menakā, Sahajanyā, Karṇikā,
<div n="lb"/>Puñjikasthalā, Ṛtusthalā, Ghṛtācī, Pūrvacitti, Ullocā,
<div n="lb"/>Pramlocā, Urvaśī and Vīśvācī. These were the celebrat-
<div n="lb"/>ed courtezans of Svarga. (Chapter 123, Ādi Parva).

<div n="lb"/>Puñjikasthalā was the dancer at the court of Kubera.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva). She took part in the
<div n="lb"/>Janmotsava of Arjuna. (Chapter 122, Ādi Parva).
