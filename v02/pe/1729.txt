DAṆḌANĪTI¦. (The laws of chastisement). Daṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>nīti is the law of punishment given to the subjects
<div n="lb"/>by Kings of ancient India. According to the criminal
<div n="lb"/>laws of ancient India, fining a man upto two hundred
<div n="lb"/>and fifty paṇas (a coin) was called Prathama Śāhasa
<div n="lb"/>daṇḍa (first degree of punishment) and fining up to
<div n="lb"/>five hundred paṇas was called Madhyama Sāhasa
[Page201-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>daṇḍa (medium punishment) and fining upto thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand paṇas was called Uttama Sāhasa daṇḍa (highest
<div n="lb"/>degree of punishment). If a man complains to
<div n="lb"/>the King that his property is stolen, when actually
<div n="lb"/>it is not stolen, the man will be fined the amount
<div n="lb"/>that is said to have been stolen. There was another
<div n="lb"/>law, that the owner of the stolen property and
<div n="lb"/>the thief would have to pay double the amount
<div n="lb"/>they admit, if the amount shown in the complaint
<div n="lb"/>differed from the actual amount stolen. For appear-
<div n="lb"/>ing as false witness, the three classes of non-Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>were punished with fine and if he was a Brahmin he
<div n="lb"/>would have to be cast out of the society. The King
<div n="lb"/>ordered that if one spent the property entrusted with
<div n="lb"/>him for keeping, the owner of the property would
<div n="lb"/>have to be paid double the amount. If one says that
<div n="lb"/>he has given the property for keeping when actually
<div n="lb"/>it is not, the person will have to be punished as if he
<div n="lb"/>were a thief. If a man spends an amount without
<div n="lb"/>knowing that it was the property of others, the man
<div n="lb"/>will have to be acquitted of the charge.
<div n="NI"/>If an artisan has received money in advance for a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular product and fails to give the thing at the stipu-
<div n="lb"/>lated time the King will fine the artisan one svarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>If a man received money in advance on a promise to
<div n="lb"/>do a particular work and if he fails to do the work he
<div n="lb"/>will be fined one Kṛṣṇala of gold. (One Kṛṣṇala
<div n="lb"/>weighs three yava grains). If a man conceals his diseases
<div n="lb"/>and marries a damsel, she will be considered as a spins-
<div n="lb"/>ter and the man will be fined two hundred paṇas.
<div n="lb"/>If a cowherd agrees to look after the cows of another
<div n="lb"/>receiving pay and food and refuses to return the cow
<div n="lb"/>to the owner the King will fine him hundred paṇas.
<div n="lb"/>If a Kṣatriya scoffed a Brāhmaṇa the fine imposed
<div n="lb"/>would be hundred paṇas. If it is a Vaiśya the fine will
<div n="lb"/>be two hundred paṇas. If it is a Śūdra he will be put
<div n="lb"/>to death. If a Brahmin scoffs a Kṣatriya the fine is
<div n="lb"/>fifty paṇas. If a Śūdra scoffs a Vaiśya the fine is twenty-
<div n="lb"/>five paṇas. If a Brahmin scoffs a Śūdra the fine is
<div n="lb"/>only twelve paṇas. If a Śūdra scoffs a Kṣatriya his
<div n="lb"/>tongue should be cut off. If a Śūdra advises a Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>he may inflict any punishment on the Śūdra.
<div n="NI"/>If a Śūdra wronged a Brahmin, the Śūdra might be
<div n="lb"/>punished by cutting off the organ which was employed
<div n="lb"/>in the crime. If one spat at a Brahmin, the two lips of
<div n="lb"/>the culprit might be cut off. If a man passed urine on a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin the culprit would have his penis cut off. If
<div n="lb"/>a Śūdra sits on the seats of the upper classes his but-
<div n="lb"/>tock will have to be cut off. If one slays cow, elephant,
<div n="lb"/>camel or horse half of his limbs will have to be cut
<div n="lb"/>off. Cutting across a road, changing of boundaries,
<div n="lb"/>making the water of pools and ponds impure etc. will
<div n="lb"/>have to be punished with a fine of two suvarṇas. (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 227).
<div n="NI"/>DAṆḌAPĀṆI I. A king of the family of Yayāti.
<div n="lb"/>This King was the son of Vibhīnara and the father
<div n="lb"/>of Nimi. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>DAṆḌAPĀṆI II. The son of Pauṇḍraka, the King
<div n="lb"/>of Kāśi. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Pauṇḍraka. As his son
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍapāṇi was not powerful enough to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>he performed the sacrifice of Maheśvara yajña. Being
<div n="lb"/>pleased at the sacrifice Śiva created Kṛtyā in the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fire and sent her to Dvārakā to destroy Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, who aimed his Sudarśana cakra (wheel-weapon)
<div n="lb"/>at her. She ran to Vārāṇasī, where the wheel turned
[Page202-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtyā and everybody with her to ashes. (Padma-
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, Chapter 278).
