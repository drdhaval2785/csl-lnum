CĀVEṬṬUPAṬA¦. (CĀVERU). (Paṭa = army).
<div n="NI"/>A particular division of the army which in olden days
<div n="lb"/>used to come forward to lay down their lives in the
<div n="lb"/>service of the country. When defeat in war was almost
<div n="lb"/>certain for their king an army division under royal
[Page181-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>leadership was formed of heroes, who took their last
<div n="lb"/>leave of their homes and people. The soldiers left their
<div n="lb"/>homes with their head and eyebrows shaved, and people
<div n="lb"/>gave them a hearty send-off. Either victory or death
<div n="lb"/>in battlefield was their slogan. This system originated
<div n="lb"/>in Kerala. Imitating Kerala, Turkey and Egypt formed
<div n="lb"/>their own division of Cāveṭṭupaṭa in the 15th century.
<div n="lb"/>The Cāveṭṭupaṭa of Turkey called the Janissary was
<div n="lb"/>formed out of poor Christians captured in war, and that
<div n="lb"/>of Egypt called Mamaluk was formed out of slaves.
<div n="lb"/>But, the Cāveṭṭupaṭa of ancient Kerala was self-orga-
<div n="lb"/>nised out of burning love for their king and country.
<div n="lb"/>The families of those warriors of the pata who died in
<div n="lb"/>fight were allotted royal favours. Even before, in the 14th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. there existed in Kerala this system of
<div n="lb"/>Cāveṭṭupaṭa. From A.D. 1090 to 1111 A.D. many fierce
<div n="lb"/>wars were fought between Kerala and the Cola country,
<div n="lb"/>and it was perhaps during this period that this system of
<div n="lb"/>fighting came into vogue. Certain inscriptions of the
<div n="lb"/>period go to prove that Rāmavarmakulaśekhara Cakra-
<div n="lb"/>varti who ruled Kerala during the above period drove
<div n="lb"/>out the Colas from Quilon and captured places up to
<div n="lb"/>Koṭṭar.
<div n="NI"/>Foreign writers have also referred to the Cāveṭṭupaṭa.
<div n="lb"/>“Amouces” and “Amochi” used in the ‘Rise of Portu-
<div n="lb"/>guese power in India’ indicate the Cāveṭṭupaṭa. “In
<div n="lb"/>the war between Cochin and Calicut in 1504 three
<div n="lb"/>princes of Cochin were killed, one of them being the
<div n="lb"/>nephew of the ruling monarch. On his death 200
<div n="lb"/>Cāveṭṭu warriors who formed the body-guard of the
<div n="lb"/>nephew rushed to the field after shaving their heads
<div n="lb"/>and eyebrows and killed all the enemies they saw.”
