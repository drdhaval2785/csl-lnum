MOKṢA II¦.
<F>1) Jīvātmā = The individual soul enshrined in the human body imparting to it life, motion and sensation as opposed to Paramātmā.
<div n="lb"/>Paramātmā = The Supreme spirit or Brahman
<div n="lb"/>Saṃsāra = The circuit of life consisting of births and rebirths with sufferings and enjoyments of woes and happiness.</F> Mokṣa means liberation and is generally
<div n="lb"/>meant to convey the meaning of the deliverance of the
<div n="lb"/>soul from recurring births. The Jīvātmā enshrined in
<div n="lb"/>the body has the delusion that it enjoys or suffers happi-
<div n="lb"/>ness or woe. In truth it neither suffers nor enjoys anything.
<div n="lb"/>It is detached from all. It is the Supreme Being (Para-
<div n="lb"/>brahman). When Jīvātmā deserts its woes it gets mokṣa
<div n="lb"/>i.e. Jīvātmā gets merged with Paramātmā. When once
<div n="lb"/>Jīvātmā merges with Paramātmā, Jīvātmā is devoid
<div n="lb"/>of happiness or woes. It need not be enshrined in any
<div n="lb"/>body. A Jīvātmā getting released from one body joins
<div n="lb"/>another new body and thus a Jīvātmā in succession
<div n="lb"/>enters thousands of bodies and each time without know-
<div n="lb"/>ing the absolute Truth laments over its woes. In the
<div n="lb"/>words of a Ṛṣi it is explained thus: “Jīvātmā, which is
<div n="lb"/>bliss in itself living in births after births searches for
<div n="lb"/>bliss elsewhere just as a person wearing a golden neck-
<div n="lb"/>lace round his neck searches for the same elsewhere.”
<div n="lb"/>The passage of Jīvātmā from one birth to another and
<div n="lb"/>the bodies that enshrine it each time constitutes the
<div n="lb"/>worldly life. When once a Jīvātmā thus involved
<div n="lb"/>in Saṃsāra (mundane existence) gets real knowledge,
<div n="lb"/>the knowledge that Jīvātmā and Paramātmā are one
<div n="lb"/>and the same, then that Jīvātmā gets final emancipa-
<div n="lb"/>tion, liberation from recurring births. It merges with
<div n="lb"/>Brahman. This is called Mokṣa.
