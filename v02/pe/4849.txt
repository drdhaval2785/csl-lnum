NIŚĀKARA I¦. A maharṣi. Honoured even by the Devas
<div n="lb"/>he lived in his āśrama on the heights of Mount Vindhya.
<div n="lb"/>One of those days Jaṭāyu and his elder brother Sampāti,
<div n="lb"/>under a bet, flew up to the Sun's sphere. In his attempt
<div n="lb"/>to shield Jaṭāyu, who flew with great speed and neared
<div n="lb"/>the Sun's sphere, from the scorching heat of the Sun,
<div n="lb"/>Sampāti's wings got burned and he fell down on the
<div n="lb"/>heights of Vindhya where he lay unconscious for six
<div n="lb"/>days.
<div n="NI"/>Niśākara maharṣi heard Sampāti crying and he saved
<div n="lb"/>the bird, which lived there for many years as the
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi's slave. The maharṣi, who could foresee things
<div n="lb"/>told Sampāti about Śrī Rāma's incarnation which was
<div n="lb"/>to happen in the future. He entered Samādhi after
<div n="lb"/>finally telling Sampāti that monkeys would go there
<div n="lb"/>then in search of Sītā, that Sampāti would point out
<div n="lb"/>to them where Sītā was and that on that day his wings
<div n="lb"/>would automatically reappear and his legs would become
<div n="lb"/>strong. Afterwards for eight thousand years Sampāti led
<div n="lb"/>a solitary life in the āśrama. It was during this period
<div n="lb"/>that monkeys, in the course of their search for Sītā got
<div n="lb"/>information about her from Sampāti. (Kamba Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Canto
<div n="lb"/>60).
