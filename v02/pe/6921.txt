SUDARŚANA¦ IX. A brahmin sinner who lived in the
<div n="lb"/>Tretāyuga. The moment he touched the water in which
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu washed his feet, he obtained remission of his
<div n="lb"/>sins and entered Vaikuṇṭha. This story which is given
<div n="lb"/>under, occurs in Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 17.
<div n="NI"/>There lived a brahmin sinner in Tretāyuga. He used
<div n="lb"/>to commit sins such as eating food on the eleventh lunar
<div n="lb"/>day, ridiculing conventional fast and vow, etc. When he
<div n="lb"/>died, the men of Yama took his soul to the world of
<div n="lb"/>Yama. At his order Sudarśana was laid in horrible
<div n="lb"/>excrements for the period of hundred Manvantaras.
<div n="lb"/>When he was released he was born on earth as a hog.
<div n="lb"/>Because he ate food on Harivāsara (a fast-day) he
<div n="lb"/>suffered hell for a long time. His next birth was that
<div n="lb"/>of a crow and lived on excrements. Once the crow
<div n="lb"/>drank the water which fell on the steps while washing
<div n="lb"/>the feet of Viṣṇu. The crow obtained remission of all
<div n="lb"/>its sins. On the same day it was caught in the net of
<div n="lb"/>a forest man and died. Then a divine chariot drawn by
<div n="lb"/>swans came and took the crow to the world of Viṣṇu.
