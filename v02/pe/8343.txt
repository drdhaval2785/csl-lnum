VIKUKṢI¦. A son of Ikṣvāku. It is said that Ikṣvāku
<div n="lb"/>was born from the spittle of Manu. It is stated in Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7, that after the death of Śaryāti,
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasas (giants) attacked Ayodhyā and the sons
<div n="lb"/>of the King having fled to different directions, Ikṣvāku
<div n="lb"/>continued the dynasty of Śaryāti in Ayodhyā. Hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons beginning with Vikukṣi, were born to Ikṣvāku.
<div n="lb"/>Of these hundred sons fifty were employed to rule
<div n="lb"/>over the regions of East and North and fortyeight, to
<div n="lb"/>rule over the regions in the south and the west. With
<div n="lb"/>the remaining two sons the King stayed in Ayodhyā,
<div n="lb"/>and carried on administration.
<div n="NI"/>One day King Ikṣvāku resolved to conduct the great
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice of offering to the manes called Mahāpralaya-
<div n="lb"/>śrāddha, for which preparations were speedily made.
<div n="lb"/>The hermits such as Vasiṣṭha and others arrived
<div n="lb"/>according to invitation. He sent his son Vikukṣi to the
<div n="lb"/>forest to bring the required amount of flesh for the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. Vikukṣi entered the forest and hunted hare,
<div n="lb"/>hog, deer etc. and collected the required quantity of
<div n="lb"/>flesh; but on the way home, he became tired of hunger.
<div n="lb"/>To appease his hunger he took a small hare from the
<div n="lb"/>collection cooked it and ate it. He took the balance to
<div n="lb"/>the King who was much pleased with his son and gave
<div n="lb"/>the animals to Vasiṣṭha the family priest for prokṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>(sprinkling of holy water on the animals before sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice). But Vasiṣṭha got angry and said, “flesh which
<div n="lb"/>constitutes remains is not acceptable.” The king
<div n="lb"/>understood the truth only then. He was filled with
<div n="lb"/>anger and distress. He expelled Vikukṣi from his
<div n="lb"/>country for this misdeed. Thus because he had eaten
<div n="lb"/>a Śaśa (hare) Vikukṣi got another name Śaśāda.
<div n="lb"/>Śaśāda not at all caring about the misfortune that be-
<div n="lb"/>fell him, went to the forest and lived on fruits and
<div n="lb"/>roots and worshipped Devī, with ardent devotion.
<div n="NI"/>Ikṣvāku died. Śaśāda knew this and returned to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā and assumed reign. He performed several
[Page855-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices on the banks of river Sarayū. The famous
<div n="lb"/>Kakutstha was the son of this Vikukṣi. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
