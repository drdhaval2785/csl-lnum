ŚĪLAVATĪ¦. A heroine reputed for her chastity and
<div n="lb"/>fidelity to her husband. Her husband, Ugraśravas was
<div n="lb"/>cruel and vicious. Yet Śīlavatī used to adore him. Once
<div n="lb"/>Ugraśravas fell a victim to the disease of leprosy. From
<div n="lb"/>that time, Śīlavatī used to go about begging in the
<div n="lb"/>houses of Brāhmaṇas to feed and support her husband.
<div n="lb"/>After some time by her constant nursing, his condition
<div n="lb"/>was slightly improved. After that she continued her
<div n="lb"/>begging from door to door, carrying him on her shoulders.
<div n="lb"/>Once they happened to arrive in front of a huge man-
<div n="lb"/>sion. Water was flowing in front of the gate and so
<div n="lb"/>Śīlavatī returned from there with her husband without
<div n="lb"/>stepping into the water. When they reached home,
<div n="lb"/>Ugraśravas asked his wife why she returned without
<div n="lb"/>entering the mansion. She explained that it was the
<div n="lb"/>house of a prostitute and to touch the water coming out
<div n="lb"/>of that house was sin. On hearing it, Ugraśravas felt
<div n="lb"/>an irresistible desire to visit that brothel. He expressed
<div n="lb"/>his desire to her. Quite obediently Śīlavatī took up her
<div n="lb"/>husband on her shoulders and went to the prostitute's
<div n="lb"/>house. (For more details see under Aṇī māṇḍavya,
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā and Atri).
