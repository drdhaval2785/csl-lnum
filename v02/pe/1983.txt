DHĪRADHĪ¦. A brahmin devotee of Śiva. He lived in
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī. Because he meditated on Śiva alone, Śiva was
<div n="lb"/>pleased with him and helped him in various ways.
<div n="NI"/>The gaṇas of Śiva were amazed at Śiva's partiality for
<div n="lb"/>Dhīradhī. Paramaśiva told them the story of the former
<div n="lb"/>birth of Dhīradhī. “This Brahmin was a swan in his
<div n="lb"/>former life. Once he was flying over a lake when he
<div n="lb"/>became tired and fell down. His colour became black.
<div n="lb"/>Then Kamalinī, another swan who dwelt in the same
<div n="lb"/>lake told him to recite the tenth Chapter of Gītā, and
<div n="lb"/>to meditate on Śiva. Because the swan did that holy
<div n="lb"/>act, he was born a Brahmin in his next birth. Though
<div n="lb"/>he was a Brahmin in his previous birth, he kicked his
<div n="lb"/>teacher and for that fault he had to take birth as a
<div n="lb"/>swan. Later, because of the love of Śiva, Dhīradhī
<div n="lb"/>attained heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 184).
