DEVALA III¦. A disciple of Vyāsa. Asita, Devala, Vai-
<div n="lb"/>śampāyana, Sumantu and Jaimini were some of the
<div n="lb"/>disciples of Vyāsa. (M.B. Prathama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa contains the following story
<div n="lb"/>about Devala. Devala was the son born to Asitamuni as
<div n="lb"/>the result of a boon granted by Śiva. Raṃbhā, the
<div n="lb"/>heavenly dancer fell in love with him. But, Devala did
<div n="lb"/>not reciprocate her love. So, she cursed him to become
<div n="lb"/>crooked in body. When he became crooked thus he
<div n="lb"/>came to be called Aṣṭāvakra. For six thousand years he
<div n="lb"/>did penance after which Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā appeared to
<div n="lb"/>him. Rādhā laughed at the uncouth form of Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="lb"/>But, Kṛṣṇa admonished her and embraced him. At once
<div n="lb"/>his bodily crookedness disappeared and he became very
<div n="lb"/>handsome. A vimāna then descended from heaven,
<div n="lb"/>and Rādhā, Kṛṣṇa and muni together disappeared in
<div n="lb"/>it.
<div n="NI"/>Ekaparṇā, daughter of Himavān was this Devala's wife.
<div n="lb"/>(Harivaṃśa, Chapter 18).
