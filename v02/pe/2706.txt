HOMAKUṆḌA¦(M). The pit for making offerings
<div n="lb"/>during yajñas. Rules about making the pit are describ-
<div n="lb"/>ed in chapter 24 of the Agni Purāṇa as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>First, demarcate a piece of ground one yard square with
<div n="lb"/>thread and dig it one yard deep. After leaving two aṃgulas
<div n="lb"/>(inches) space on all the four sides of the pit make three
<div n="lb"/>divisions in it. The three divisions should be 12”×8” and
<div n="lb"/>4” deep; the inner division 12” deep, the middle one 8”
<div n="lb"/>and the one outside of it 4” deep. All the three divi-
<div n="lb"/>sions should be four feet in width. The above three
<div n="lb"/>divisions are called Satvamekhalā, Rajomekhala and
<div n="lb"/>Tāmasamekhalā, and this is the pit, viz. Homakuṇḍa.
<div n="lb"/>On the western side of it a yoni (receptacle) 10×15
<div n="lb"/>aṃgulas should be made. Its depth should gradually
<div n="lb"/>decrease in the descending order 6, 4, 2 aṃgulas. In
<div n="lb"/>shape the yoni will be of the shape of the peepal leaf.
<div n="lb"/>(Yoni is that of Śakti; the Kuṇḍa is her stomach. The
<div n="lb"/>conception about Śakti is that of a woman lying on
<div n="lb"/>her back, head towards the east.). The priest performs
<div n="lb"/>the rites, himself seated to the west of the yoni and his
<div n="lb"/>head turned to the east.
