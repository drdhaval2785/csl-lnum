AVINDHYA¦. A giant in whom Rāvaṇa had confidence.
<div n="lb"/>But he held the opinion that Sītā should be returned
<div n="lb"/>to Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>“The aged giant and noble leader Avindhya, who had
<div n="lb"/>earned the confidence of Rāvaṇa, brave, learned and of
<div n="lb"/>good qualities, pleaded with Rāvaṇa and said that
<div n="lb"/>Rāma would exterminate the entire race of the giants
[Page084-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>but the wicked Rāvaṇa would not pay heed to his
<div n="lb"/>words.”
<div n="NI"/>(Śrī Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 37,
<div n="lb"/>Stanzas 12 and 13). This aged giant had sent Trijatā
<div n="lb"/>to the Aśoka park to console Sītā. Hear what she says:
<div n="lb"/>“The famous giant leader, the noble aged well-wisher
<div n="lb"/>of Rāma, Avindhya, had told me about you.”
<div n="NI"/>“(M.B., Araṇya Parva, Stanza 56). There is a situa-
<div n="lb"/>tion in Vana Parva when this noble giant prevented
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa from his attempt to kill Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>“When he saw the decision of Rāvaṇa to kill Sītā,
<div n="lb"/>Avandhya pacified Rāvaṇa” and said, “you, a great King
<div n="lb"/>of a great kingdom should not deteriorate to the level
<div n="lb"/>of killing a woman. A woman who is in prison and at
<div n="lb"/>your disposal is as good as dead. But in my opinion, even
<div n="lb"/>if you cut her body into pieces she would not die and
<div n="lb"/>if she must die you will have to kill her husband.”
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapter 289, Stanzas 28 to 30).
<div n="NI"/>From this statement the wonderful intelligence of
<div n="lb"/>Avindhya could be understood. It is seen in stanzas 6
<div n="lb"/>and 7 of Chapter 291 of M.B., Vana Parva that it was
<div n="lb"/>Avindhya who had taken Sītā before Śrī Rāma when
<div n="lb"/>he had captured Laṅkā.
