ŚAKUNA¦(OMENS).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} In ancient times people in all countries used
<div n="lb"/>to consider Śakunas to be harbingers of good or evil things.
<div n="lb"/>Today also many people believe in omens. In India
[Page669-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śakuna had developed as a science even in olden days.
<div n="lb"/>A general description about omens, good and bad,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Indian concept, is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Mixed medicines, black grains, cotton, grass, dried cow-
<div n="lb"/>dung, charcoal, molasses, one whose head is shaven clean
<div n="lb"/>or whose body is smeared with oil or who is naked; flesh-
<div n="lb"/>eater; iron, dirt, skin, hair of the head, insane person,
<div n="lb"/>eunuch, prison, guard; women, who are either carrying
<div n="lb"/>or are widows; oil cake, paddy husk, ashes, skull, bone,
<div n="lb"/>broken vessel etc. are evil omens. Broken, fierce or mur-
<div n="lb"/>muring instrumental music also is a bad omen.
<div n="NI"/>It is a good omen to hear the voice of beckoning (come)
<div n="lb"/>in front of the traveller, but it is not good if the voice is
<div n="lb"/>heard from behind. It is good if the voice of farewell (go)
<div n="lb"/>is heard from behind, but is bad to be heard in the front.
<div n="lb"/>Disapproving or prohibitive words like “Where are you
<div n="lb"/>going, stop, don't go”, “what is to be done by going
<div n="lb"/>there?” etc. will cause death. It is a bad omen to see
<div n="lb"/>carnivorous birds perched on the top of flag-staff etc.
<div n="lb"/>For vehicles to bump, weapons to break and head to
<div n="lb"/>get wounded by dashing against doors etc. as also for
<div n="lb"/>umbrella or clothes to fall down are ill omens. Praising
<div n="lb"/>or worshipping Viṣṇu will do away with the inauspicious
<div n="lb"/>results of ill omens. But, if evil omens are seen conti-
<div n="lb"/>nuously the traveller should return home.
<div n="NI"/>White flowers are good omens. Full pots are the best
<div n="lb"/>of omens. Flesh, fish, sound from afar, old man, soli-
<div n="lb"/>tary man, cow, goat, ox, horse, elephant, devas, burning
<div n="lb"/>fire, Dūrvā grass, fresh cow-dung, prostitute, gold,
<div n="lb"/>silver, gems, Orris root, mustard, medicinal herbs rooted
<div n="lb"/>out of soil, Bengal gram, weapon, sword, stool, royal
<div n="lb"/>symbols, dead body being carried without lamentation,
<div n="lb"/>fruits, ghee, curdled milk, milk, akṣata, mirror, honey,
<div n="lb"/>conch, sugarcane, auspicious words, music by devotees,
<div n="lb"/>loud thunder and lightning are auspicious omens.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Two kinds of omens.%} Omens are divided into two varie-
<div n="lb"/>ties, dīpta (glowing) and śānta (quiescent, mild). Glow-
<div n="lb"/>ing omens bring about auspicious results and the other in-
<div n="lb"/>auspicious results. There are six ways or elements, which
<div n="lb"/>make omens dīptam, i.e. velā (time), dik (region), deśa
<div n="lb"/>(place), Karaṇa (action), ruta (cry) and jāti (kind). The
<div n="lb"/>power or effect of dīpta increases in ascending order.
<div n="NI"/>To see creatures, which move about during day time as
<div n="lb"/>moving about during night and vice-versa is velādīpta.
<div n="lb"/>In the case of stars, lagnas (the dominant zodiac) and
<div n="lb"/>planets, those which are virulent are considered to
<div n="lb"/>be dīptas. With regard to stars and lagnas, those
<div n="lb"/>which the Sun enters into are dhūmita, those where-
<div n="lb"/>in the Sun is already present are jvalita and those from
<div n="lb"/>which the sun has left are Aṃ ariṇī. These three are
<div n="lb"/>dīptas and the rest śāntas. (This is called velādīpta).
<div n="lb"/>When dik (region) is dīpta it is called digdīpta.
<div n="lb"/>To see forest animals in village and village-animals in
<div n="lb"/>forest is digdīpta. To see good brahmins at inauspi-
<div n="lb"/>cious places is deśadīpta. To see some one doing work
<div n="lb"/>not ordained to his caste is karaṇadīpta. To hear differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent horrible voices is rutadīpta. To see purely flesh-
<div n="lb"/>eating animals is jātidīpta. If all the characteristics of
<div n="lb"/>dīpta do not synchronise but differ from one another it
<div n="lb"/>is called śānta and if the characteristics of dīpta and
<div n="lb"/>śānta are mixed up it is called miśra.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birds, animals etc.%} If the cāṣa bird (wild crow) makes
<div n="lb"/>sound when the king gets out of the palace, he will meet
<div n="lb"/>with dishonour. If the sound is heard on the left side,
<div n="lb"/>there will be quarrel, but food will be served. If the
[Page669-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>bird is sighted on the right side at the start of the
<div n="lb"/>journey, it is a good omen. If the peacock makes differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent sounds, threats from thieves will result. If a deer
<div n="lb"/>is seen in front of the king going out on a journey, death
<div n="lb"/>will happen to him. To see the monkey-bear, rat, tiger,
<div n="lb"/>lion, cat and donkey coming in the opposite direction
<div n="lb"/>also will bring about death. Donkey braying in awkward
<div n="lb"/>notes is also inauspicious. To see kapiñjala bird on the
<div n="lb"/>left side is an excellent omen; on the right side also it is
<div n="lb"/>not bad. But, behind the person, it is a bad omen.
<div n="lb"/>Tittiri bird also on the rear is not good.
<div n="NI"/>It is always a good omen if the deer, boar and spotted
<div n="lb"/>deer cross the path from the left to the right side; the
<div n="lb"/>opposite of it is bad omen. It is a favourable omen if the
<div n="lb"/>ox, horse, jackal, tiger, lion, cat and donkey pass from
<div n="lb"/>the right to the left side. It is auspicious to see the
<div n="lb"/>females of the jackal etc. on the right side and the
<div n="lb"/>males on the left. To hear the serpent, hare, boar and
<div n="lb"/>wild lizard named is good, but to see them is not so.
<div n="lb"/>Contrary to this is the effect to see the monkey, ox etc.
<div n="lb"/>The result of the important and powerful omens witness-
<div n="lb"/>ed at the start of the journey will be experienced the
<div n="lb"/>very same day. The omen of the intoxicated, those
<div n="lb"/>craving for food, children, people quarrelling and those
<div n="lb"/>who stand away from the limits of the road is effectless.
<div n="lb"/>To hear the jackal howl once, twice, thrice or four
<div n="lb"/>times is a good omen, but to hear it five or six times
<div n="lb"/>is bad, The seventh time is good.
<div n="NI"/>If heard for more than the seventh time it will have no
<div n="lb"/>effect. Dīpta omen facing the Sun will horripilate
<div n="lb"/>men, cause fear in the case of vehicles and is to
<div n="lb"/>be greatly feared. If sāraṅga (lotus, deer, elephant,
<div n="lb"/>peacock, cuckoo, lion, horse etc.) is met as the first
<div n="lb"/>thing in an auspicious place its good effect will last for
<div n="lb"/>one year, and if these are met at the inauspicious place,
<div n="lb"/>the result will be bad. Everybody should see sāraṅga
<div n="lb"/>at some auspicious place every dawn.
<div n="NI"/>If the crow is found crowing in fear on the left side of
<div n="lb"/>camps put up for the army of the King, the head of
<div n="lb"/>the army will have to face great threats. If the crow,
<div n="lb"/>perches on and pecks on the shadow, vehicle, slippers,
<div n="lb"/>umbrella, clothes etc. the owner of those things will
<div n="lb"/>die. If they are respected by the crow, honour will
<div n="lb"/>accrue to their owner. If the crow flies about the
<div n="lb"/>entrance of the house it means that he, who had left
<div n="lb"/>the house will return. If the crows bring and scatter
<div n="lb"/>red coloured and baked things in the courtyard, the
<div n="lb"/>owner of the house will meet with imprisonment. If
<div n="lb"/>the crow carries to a house something yellow in colour,
<div n="lb"/>gold or silver, the owner of the house will get such
<div n="lb"/>things. Whatever thing the crow carries away from the
<div n="lb"/>house, such things therein will be destroyed. If the
<div n="lb"/>crow vomits raw flesh in the rear of the house, the
<div n="lb"/>owner of it will come into possession of wealth; if soil is
<div n="lb"/>deposited thus, land will be acquired. If gem is
<div n="lb"/>deposited, extensive lands will come to the owner of
<div n="lb"/>the house. If the crow flies in the same direction as the
<div n="lb"/>one chosen by the traveller, prosperity and success
<div n="lb"/>will result to him and if it flies in the opposite direction
<div n="lb"/>not only will the traveller not achieve his object but,
<div n="lb"/>he will also meet with danger. If the crows come crowing
<div n="lb"/>against one starting on a journey, it will be hindered.
<div n="lb"/>To see the crow on the left side is a good omen. If it
<div n="lb"/>is seen on the right side, the journey will not end in
<div n="lb"/>success. It is very good if the crow flies in the same
[Page670-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>direction as the traveller on his left side, if on
<div n="lb"/>the right side the result will be of medium nature. If
<div n="lb"/>it flies in the opposite direction on the left side the tra-
<div n="lb"/>veller will face hindrance. If the crow flies into the
<div n="lb"/>house when one is about to start on the journey, it
<div n="lb"/>means the journey may be begun. The crow which
<div n="lb"/>looks at the sun with one eye and perched on one leg
<div n="lb"/>is surely indicative of fear for the traveller. If it is in
<div n="lb"/>the hollow of a tree great calamities will happen. To
<div n="lb"/>dream of crow with its mouth full of excretion is indi-
<div n="lb"/>cative of all-round success.
<div n="NI"/>If the dog enters and barks in the house the result will be
<div n="lb"/>sure death of the owner of the house. But, if the dog
<div n="lb"/>smells on the left side of the man it is good, and if it
<div n="lb"/>smells on the right side, it is bad. If the dogs come
<div n="lb"/>against the person about to start on a journey, it will
<div n="lb"/>cause hindrance to him. If the dog stands blocking his
<div n="lb"/>path there will be threat from thieves. If it comes fac-
<div n="lb"/>ing him with a piece of bone in its mouth, he will fail
<div n="lb"/>to achieve the object of his travel; if it comes biting a
<div n="lb"/>cord, the same will be the result. It is auspicious to see
<div n="lb"/>dog, which carries a slipper in its mouth or the mouth
<div n="lb"/>of which is filled with flesh. Fear will overtake him in
<div n="lb"/>front of whom the dog urinates and goes away. But if
<div n="lb"/>not a bitch and if, after urination, it goes to an auspi-
<div n="lb"/>cious place, to the shade of an auspicious tree or to-
<div n="lb"/>wards an auspicious thing, then it is a good omen. The
<div n="lb"/>same considerations are valid in the case of the jackal
<div n="lb"/>etc.
<div n="NI"/>If cows cry without cause or reason, it indicates ruin
<div n="lb"/>to the master. If the cry is in an awkward tone, death
<div n="lb"/>will result. If the ox murmurs during night, it is good
<div n="lb"/>for the master. Ox tied to a cord also is good omen.
<div n="lb"/>If cows are found to treat their calves without love, it
<div n="lb"/>spells ruin for pregnant women. It is a good omen to
<div n="lb"/>see cows which have got wet and whose horns are smeared
<div n="lb"/>with earth. These considerations apply to buffaloes as
<div n="lb"/>well.
<div n="NI"/>If elephants indulge in the sexual act in villages, it
<div n="lb"/>augurs ill to the villages. If the she-elephant delivers
<div n="lb"/>or gets mad in the country, i.e. not in the forest, it
<div n="lb"/>spells ruin to king. Ruin to the King will be the result if
<div n="lb"/>the elephant objects to his mounting it or runs back
<div n="lb"/>home or if the mad elephant is found without madness.
<div n="lb"/>It is an auspicious omen if the elephant places its right
<div n="lb"/>foot on the left foot of it and also if it holds its tusk
<div n="lb"/>with its trunk.
