CANDRĀVATĪ¦. Daughter of Sunābha, the asura.
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna, son born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa of Rukmiṇī, married
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāvatī, daughter of the asura called Vajranābha.
<div n="lb"/>Sunābha was the younger brother of Vajranābha.
<div n="lb"/>Sunābha had two daughters called Candrāvatī and
<div n="lb"/>Guṇavatī. These girls once saw Pradyumna and Prabhā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī engaged in love-talk and they were attracted by
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna. They requested Prabhāvatī to select hus-
<div n="lb"/>bands for them also from among the Yādavas. Prabhā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, in her childhood had learnt from Durvāsas a
<div n="lb"/>mantra, the repetition of which by a woman thinking
<div n="lb"/>in mind of any male would help to secure that male as the
<div n="lb"/>husband for her. Prabhāvatī taught that mantra to
<div n="lb"/>Candrāvatī and Guṇavatī. They thought respectively
<div n="lb"/>of Gada and Sāmba and repeated the mantra with the
<div n="lb"/>result that Gada married Candrāvatī and Sāmba married
<div n="lb"/>Guṇavatī.
