DHARMADATTA I¦. A king of Kosala. He had a wife
<div n="lb"/>named Nāgaśrī. By her chastity she became a celebrity
<div n="lb"/>and got the name of Arundhatī of the earth. They got
<div n="lb"/>a daughter named Tārādattā. Once when Dharmadatta
<div n="lb"/>and Nāgaśrī were engaged in conversation both remem-
[Page225-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>bered their lives in their previous births. It was not
<div n="lb"/>allowed to speak about previous births in open and if
<div n="lb"/>anybody did so death was the penalty. But Nāgaśrī
<div n="lb"/>could not control herself and prepared to accept the
<div n="lb"/>worst. Nāgaśrī told her husband thus: “I am just remin-
<div n="lb"/>ded of my life in my previous birth. I will tell you my
<div n="lb"/>story. I was the servant maid of a brahmin named
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava in this same place. I had a husband named
<div n="lb"/>Devadāsa then. My husband was the son of a merchant.
<div n="lb"/>We made a small house of our own and lived there
<div n="lb"/>peacefully. Each of us would bring food from where we
<div n="lb"/>worked and everyday we used to set apart a portion of
<div n="lb"/>what we got for guests and the pitṛs. We were satisfied
<div n="lb"/>with what was left after that. If we got more than one
<div n="lb"/>set of clothes we would give it to the poor. Then there
<div n="lb"/>came a famine in the country. Our earning also was
<div n="lb"/>reduced daily. We lived in hunger. One day a hungry
<div n="lb"/>and tired sannyāsī came to our place and we gave him
<div n="lb"/>the whole of our food. My husband died that
<div n="lb"/>day and I gave away my life jumping into the funeral
<div n="lb"/>pyre of my husband. Then I was born in the family of
<div n="lb"/>a King and became your wife.”
<div n="NI"/>Dharmadatta also got back the memory of his previous
<div n="lb"/>birth. He said he was the Devadāsa of Nāgaśrī's
<div n="lb"/>previous life.
<div n="NI"/>The moment they finished talking about their previous
<div n="lb"/>births both fell down dead. Orphaned Tārādattā then
<div n="lb"/>lived under the care of her mother's younger sister.
<div n="lb"/>After some time a Maharṣi came to their house and by
<div n="lb"/>his blessing Tārādattā got a husband named Kaliṅga-
<div n="lb"/>sena. Kaliṅgasena was a brave and daring Prince. Very
<div n="lb"/>soon they got a daughter and she was named Kaliṅga-
<div n="lb"/>senā. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañjukā laṃbaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 2).
