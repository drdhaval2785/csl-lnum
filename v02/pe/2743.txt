INDIA¦. ‘South Śarakh’, a newspaper published from
<div n="lb"/>the United Arab Republic with the assistance of the
<div n="lb"/>Indian Embassy gives the following account of how the
<div n="lb"/>land originally known as ‘Bhārata’ came to be called
<div n="lb"/>India. The name ‘India’ was given to “Bhārata” by
<div n="lb"/>the Arabs. Even from very early times, Arabs used to
<div n="lb"/>give the name ‘Hind’ to their girls. In ancient Arabic
<div n="lb"/>love poems, this name could be seen very frequently.
<div n="lb"/>There were commercial and cultural contacts between
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata and Arab lands, from very old times. The
<div n="lb"/>words ‘Kharan Fūl’ (spices) ‘Pulfūl’ (Pepper) etc.
<div n="lb"/>may be seen in Arabic poems of the pre-Islamic period.
<div n="lb"/>These contacts became more intimate in later years and
<div n="lb"/>the Arabs began to take very great interest in the pro-
<div n="lb"/>ducts and the people of this country. They began to
<div n="lb"/>call ‘Bhārata’ by the pet name ‘Hind’ which they
<div n="lb"/>used for their little children. They began to use the
<div n="lb"/>term ‘Al Hind’ when referring to Bhārata in their
<div n="lb"/>poems, records and trade agreements In course of time
<div n="lb"/>this was shortened to ‘Hind’ and finally became
<div n="lb"/>‘INDIA’.
