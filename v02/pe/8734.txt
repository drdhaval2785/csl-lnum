YAŚAS¦. Father of Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16, mentions that towards
<div n="lb"/>the end of Kaliyuga all people will become atheists,
<div n="lb"/>there will be an intermixture of castes and all people
<div n="lb"/>will become thieves and devoid of virtue. At that time,
<div n="lb"/>the 15 branches of the Veda called Vājasaneyas alone
<div n="lb"/>will be the authority. Mlecchas (low-class people)
<div n="lb"/>assuming the form of Kings will begin to eat human
<div n="lb"/>beings. Agni Purāṇa states further that at that time,
<div n="lb"/>Lord Viṣṇu will incarnate as Kalki, the son of Yaśas
<div n="lb"/>and Yājñavalkya's priest and after training himself in
<div n="lb"/>archery and weapons, annihilate all Mlecchas.
