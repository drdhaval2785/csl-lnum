JAMBUKA¦. (JAMBUMĀLIKA). A Śūdra Sage. The
<div n="lb"/>child of a brahmin died when Śrī Rāma, after his twelve
<div n="lb"/>years’ exile in forest had returned to Ayodhyā and was
<div n="lb"/>ruling the country in an ideal manner. The brahmin
<div n="lb"/>and his wife carried the dead body of their child to the
<div n="lb"/>palace with loud lamentations. Everybody felt surprised
<div n="lb"/>how there could be child-death in the land when the
<div n="lb"/>King was ruling it in the most dhārmic (righteous)
<div n="lb"/>manner. Then did Nārada, who was present in the
<div n="lb"/>assembly, point out that in a corner of Rāmarājya a
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra Sage was doing tapas and that it was the reason
<div n="lb"/>for the untimely death of the brahmin child. At once
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma set out in search of the Śūdra Sage after
<div n="lb"/>directing Śatrughna to see that no enemy entered the
<div n="lb"/>country, and asking Lakṣmaṇa to take care of the dead
<div n="lb"/>body of the brahmin child. After a rather detailed
<div n="lb"/>search Śrī Rāma found Jambuka at the mountain called
<div n="lb"/>Śailam doing tapas hanging from the branch of a tree
<div n="lb"/>on his legs with head down. He told Śrī Rāma that he
<div n="lb"/>was the Śūdra Sage called Jambuka and was performing
<div n="lb"/>tapas thus so that he might ascend to heaven in his very
<div n="lb"/>body. Śrī Rāma at once cut off the head of the Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>Sage, who attained, as soon as Rāma's sword fell on him,
<div n="lb"/>mokṣa (salvation), and the dead child of the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>returned to life again. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
