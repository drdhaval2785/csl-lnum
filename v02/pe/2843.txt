JĀMBAVATĪ¦. Daughter of the famous Jāmbavān. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa went in search of the famous precious stone
<div n="lb"/>Syamantaka which was lost when Prasena wore it and
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest for hunting. Kṛṣṇa found it in the
<div n="lb"/>cave of Jāmbavān, who fought with him and was
<div n="lb"/>defeated. Finally he gave his daughter Jāmbavatī to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa as wife, and the jewel Syamantaka as dowry.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to his capital Dvārakā with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbavatī. When sons were born to the other wives
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇa she became sad and requested her husband
<div n="lb"/>that sons may be born to her also. On hearing this
<div n="lb"/>request Kṛṣṇa went to the mountain where the
<div n="lb"/>hermit Upamanyu was engaged in penance. With that
<div n="lb"/>hermit who was an ardent devotee of Śiva, as his
<div n="lb"/>teacher, Kṛṣṇa began a penance before Śiva, in
<div n="lb"/>accordance with his (Upamanyu's) advice. The
<div n="lb"/>penance, holding yogadaṇḍa and Kapāla (devotee's
<div n="lb"/>staff and skull) lasted for a month. In the second
<div n="lb"/>month penance was performed standing on one leg and
<div n="lb"/>drinking only water. In the third month he did
<div n="lb"/>penance standing on toes only and using air as food.
<div n="lb"/>After six months Paramaśiva appeared and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him that his wives would have ten sons each. Accor-
<div n="lb"/>dingly Jāmbavatī gave birth to her first son who was
<div n="lb"/>named Sāmba. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
