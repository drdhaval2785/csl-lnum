DHARMASVA¦. A Brahmin. Once this Brahmin was
<div n="lb"/>coming home with water from the Gaṇges. On the way
<div n="lb"/>he saw Kāpakalpa, the servant of merchant Ratnākara,
<div n="lb"/>being killed by an ox. Though Kāpakalpa was a sinner,
<div n="lb"/>his end aroused pity in the heart of the Brahmin. So he
<div n="lb"/>sprinkled the Ganges-water on the body of Kāpakalpa,
<div n="lb"/>who instantly regained life and energy. The Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>who saw the power of Ganges-water began to worship
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges from that day onwards. It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa, Kriyā Khaṇḍa, Chapter 7, that finally
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmin got a boon from the Ganges that only
<div n="lb"/>uttering the name of the Ganges should he meet with
<div n="lb"/>death.
