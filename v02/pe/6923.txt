SUDARŚANĀ¦ XI. A wife of God Fire. This Sudarśanā
<div n="lb"/>was the daughter of Duryodhana, the son of Durjaya
<div n="lb"/>of the Ikṣvāku dynasty. The mother of Sudarśanā
<div n="lb"/>was Narmadā. It is said that so beautiful a woman as
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśanā had never been born. The God Fire was
<div n="lb"/>once fascinated by the beauty of Sudarśanā who had
<div n="lb"/>been instructed to serve him, and wished to accept her
<div n="lb"/>as his wife. So he informed her of his desire. Being
[Page752-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of a noble race, she said that a virgin ought to be given
<div n="lb"/>away by her parents. The God Fire approached the
<div n="lb"/>father of Sudarśanā and informed him of every thing.
<div n="lb"/>When he knew that the person who made the request
<div n="lb"/>was the God Fire, the king gave his daughter Sudarśanā
<div n="lb"/>as wife to the God. (Duryodhana had another name
<div n="lb"/>Nīla). In the Purāṇas there is another statement also
<div n="lb"/>that Nīla was the ruler of Māhiṣmatī. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana II and Agni Para 8).
