MĀRKAṆḌEYA¦. The son of Mṛkaṇḍu. He was a great
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Bhṛgu, son of Brahmā, begot of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Khyāti a daughter named Lakṣmī and two sons named
<div n="lb"/>Dhātā and Vidhātā.
<div n="NI"/>Dhātā and Vidhātā married Āyati and Niyati daughters
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāmeru. Dhātā begot of his wife Āyati a son
<div n="lb"/>named Prāṇa and Niyati bore Vidhātā a son named
<div n="lb"/>Mṛkaṇḍu Mārkaṇḍeya was the son of Mṛkaṇḍu and
<div n="lb"/>Vedaśiras was the son of Mārkaṇḍeya.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Mṛkaṇḍu did not have sons for a long time and
<div n="lb"/>so he performed penance for several years to please Śiva
<div n="lb"/>to get a son. Śiva appeared before him in person and
<div n="lb"/>asked him thus “Do you desire to have a virtuous, wise and
<div n="lb"/>pious son who would live up to sixteen years or a dull-
<div n="lb"/>witted evil-natured son who would live long?” Mṛkaṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>chose the first type and soon a son was born. He was
<div n="lb"/>named Mārkaṇḍeya. Even from boyhood Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>knew all the Vedas and śāstras. His pleasing manners
<div n="lb"/>got the approval of his teachers and the boy was liked by
<div n="lb"/>one and all. But the parents were sad and whenever they
<div n="lb"/>looked at their son a gloom spread over their face. The
<div n="lb"/>secret of the short span of his life was hidden from him.
<div n="NI"/>The sixteenth year was fast approaching and one day
<div n="lb"/>unable to control their grief they wept before him. Mār-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇḍeya asked them the reason why they wept. Mṛkaṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>with tears running down his cheeks told him the story.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards Mārkaṇḍeya started performing
<div n="lb"/>penance wearing barks of trees for his dress and growing
<div n="lb"/>matted hair. The boy was soon engrossed in severe aus-
<div n="lb"/>terities.
<div n="NI"/>The day of his death came and the boy sat before the
<div n="lb"/>idol of Śiva in deep meditation. The servants of the god
<div n="lb"/>of Death could not approach Mārkaṇḍeya for the radia-
<div n="lb"/>tion from him was too hot for them. So Yama, the god
<div n="lb"/>of Death, himself came to fetch him. Then Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>crying loudly for help embraced the idol before him.
<div n="lb"/>Yama threw his rope in a loop and it went and circled
<div n="lb"/>round the idol also. Angry Śiva rose from the idol and
[Page488-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>coming down killed Yama to save the child. From that
<div n="lb"/>day onwards Śiva got the names Mṛtyuñjaya and Kāla-
<div n="lb"/>kāla. After that at the request of the devas Śiva gave
<div n="lb"/>life to Yama again and made Mārkaṇḍeya to be of six-
<div n="lb"/>teen years for ever.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Penance of Mārkaṇḍeya.%} The Purāṇas state that after
<div n="lb"/>getting the blessing from Śiva, Mārkaṇḍeya lived for ten
<div n="lb"/>crores of years. While he was in deep meditation six
<div n="lb"/>Manvantaras passed away. When Mārkaṇḍeya conti-
<div n="lb"/>nued his meditation to the seventh Manvantara Indra
<div n="lb"/>got frightened and he made an attempt to abort the
<div n="lb"/>penance of Mārkaṇḍeya. Indra sent his troops of
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas, nymphs, Manmatha and Vasanta to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Mārkaṇḍeya. The āśrama of Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>was at a place which was on the northern side of the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas and was famous by the presence there of
<div n="lb"/>the river Puṣpabhadrā and the rock Citra. The agents
<div n="lb"/>of Indra came there and tried to entice him with many
<div n="lb"/>temptations. Beautiful celestial maidens danced around
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama. Flowers fell from their hair when their
<div n="lb"/>waists shook by the weight of their heavy breasts. En-
<div n="lb"/>chanting girls played with balls here and there. As they
<div n="lb"/>played the bracelets on their waists fell down and the
<div n="lb"/>thin garments that hid their bodies flew up showing an
<div n="lb"/>alluring nakedness. Kāma (God of Love) sent his arrows
<div n="lb"/>at that time against the sage. But Mārkaṇḍeya sat un-
<div n="lb"/>concerned as rigid as a rock and Indra accepted defeat.
<div n="lb"/>When Indra and his troops returned disappointed Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu with many sages went to Mārkaṇḍeya. He awoke
<div n="lb"/>from his meditation and worshipped Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Vision of Pralaya.%} On one evening at dusk Mārkaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍeya was sitting at Puṣpabhadrātīra when from some-
<div n="lb"/>where a wind began to blow. The wind increased in
<div n="lb"/>strength and the sky became covered with clouds. The
<div n="lb"/>place resounded with peals of thunder and soon it began
<div n="lb"/>to rain. Rains became heavy. Rivers became flooded and
<div n="lb"/>water-level in the oceans rose. Everything around was
<div n="lb"/>submerged in water and Mārkaṇḍeya alone stood there
<div n="lb"/>with his matted hair swinging in the wind. It was im-
<div n="lb"/>possible to know the directions and Mārkaṇḍeya started
<div n="lb"/>walking. He fell into whirlpools but was the next instant
<div n="lb"/>thrown up on to the top of surging waves. Then he saw
<div n="lb"/>on the top of a high wave a banyan tree. On a branch
<div n="lb"/>on the north-east of the tree he saw an infant lying, de-
<div n="lb"/>vouring the darkness by its effulgence. He was attracted
<div n="lb"/>to the infant by its vital force and went inside the infant
<div n="lb"/>as it inhaled. Inside the belly of the kid Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>had a vision of the entire universe. He saw the sky, the
<div n="lb"/>horizon, the stars, the oceans, the mountains expanses of
<div n="lb"/>land, Suras, Asuras, forests and all that the universe
<div n="lb"/>contained in its proper set-up. He saw passing before
<div n="lb"/>his eyes the elements, the Yugas and the Manvantaras.
<div n="lb"/>After some time he was thrown out by an exhalation of
<div n="lb"/>the infant. He stood on the waters. The old banyan
<div n="lb"/>tree was still there. An infant was still lying on a leaf on
<div n="lb"/>that tree. Mārkaṇḍeya then knew it was Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>He rushed to embrace the child; but the child disappear-
<div n="lb"/>ed before he reached it. Mārkaṇḍeya praised Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Pārvatī and Parameśvara come to Mārkaṇḍeya.%} When
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu disappeared from his vision he felt he was
<div n="lb"/>sitting at Puṣpabhadrātīra and he again went into
<div n="lb"/>meditation. At that time Pārvatī and Parameśvara came
<div n="lb"/>that way and appeared before Mārkaṇḍeya. The sage
<div n="lb"/>worshipped them and they both blessed Mārkaṇḍeya
[Page489-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and said “Every desire of yours will be fulfilled. You
<div n="lb"/>will never be rugous or grey-haired and will live virtu-
<div n="lb"/>ous and famous till the end of the world. Omniscience
<div n="lb"/>will be an asset for you”. After having said so much
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī and Parameśvara disappeared. The Purāṇic be-
<div n="lb"/>lief is that the realised soul of Mārkaṇḍeya is moving
<div n="lb"/>about in the universe. (10th Skandha, Chapters 8 to 11,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
