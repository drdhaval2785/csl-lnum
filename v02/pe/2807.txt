JĀBĀLI III¦. A hermit. The descendants of this hermit
<div n="lb"/>also are known by this name. Jābāli who performed
<div n="lb"/>penance on the mountain of Mandara had several disci-
<div n="lb"/>ples.
<div n="NI"/>While Jābāli was going along the forest he saw a young
<div n="lb"/>man of handsome appearance engaged in penance on
<div n="lb"/>the shore of a lake. Jābāli wanted to know about him
<div n="lb"/>and his penance. But as the young man was in deep
<div n="lb"/>meditation Jābāli had to wait there for several years.
<div n="lb"/>At last the young man awoke from his meditation and
<div n="lb"/>told Jābāli the secrets of devotional meditation and con-
<div n="lb"/>templation of Kṛṣṇa. The remaining life of Jābāli was
<div n="lb"/>spent in the worship of Kṛṣṇa, in consequence of which
<div n="lb"/>in the next birth he was reborn as a cowherdess,
<div n="lb"/>named Citragandhā in the house of the cowherd Pra-
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍa. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>30, 72 and 109).
