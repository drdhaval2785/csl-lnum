INDRADYUMNA VI¦. A king who lived in the Kṛta
<div n="lb"/>yuga, and a devotee of Viṣṇu. He visited the Jagan-
<div n="lb"/>nātha temple in Oḍra Deśa once to worship Lord
<div n="lb"/>Jagannātha. The Lord was then hidden in the sand.
<div n="lb"/>When the King, disappointed at this was about to
<div n="lb"/>return, determined to fast unto death at Mount Nīla
<div n="lb"/>when a celestial voice cried, “Thou shalt see Him”.
<div n="lb"/>Afterwards the King performed a horse sacrifice and
<div n="lb"/>built a magnificent Viṣṇu temple. Narasiṃhamūrti
<div n="lb"/>brought by Nārada was installed in the temple.
<div n="lb"/>During sleep the King had a darśana (sight) of Lord
<div n="lb"/>Jagannātha. Also an astral voice directed him to cut
<div n="lb"/>down the fragrant tree on the seashore and make
<div n="lb"/>idols with it. Accordingly the king got idols of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, Balarāma, Sudarśana and Subhadrā made and
<div n="lb"/>installed them in the temple. (Skanda Purāṇa).
