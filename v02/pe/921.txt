BALI¦ (MAHĀBALI) I. An emperor of the Asuras. He
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Virocana and the grandson of Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} The Asuras or the Daityas are
<div n="lb"/>the sons born, of his wife Diti, to Kaśyapa Prajāpati, son
<div n="lb"/>of Marīci and grandson of Brahmā. There were so
<div n="lb"/>many Asuras born as the sons of Diti. But among them
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Śūrapadmā, Siṃhavaktra,
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura and Gomukha were notorious. Of their
<div n="lb"/>sisters Siṃhikā and Ajamukhī were famous.
<div n="NI"/>Four sons called Prahlāda, Saṃhrāda, Hrāda and
<div n="lb"/>Anuhrāda were born to Hiraṇyakaśipu. Virocana was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Prahlāda and Mahābali was the son of Viro-
<div n="lb"/>cana. Bāṇa was born from Mahābali and four crores of
<div n="lb"/>Asuras called Nivātakavacas were born from Bāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The churning of the ocean.%} Once Mahābali had stolen
<div n="lb"/>the wealth of Devendra. While he was carrying it to
<div n="lb"/>his house, it all fell in the ocean. Mahāviṣṇu ordered
<div n="lb"/>the devas (gods) to recover the lost wealth from the
[Page103-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ocean. It was impossible to churn the ocean without
<div n="lb"/>the help of Mahābali. So the devas went to Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>and sought his help. Mahābali agreed to help them.
<div n="NI"/>The real aim of the devas was not to regain the lost
<div n="lb"/>wealth but to obtain the celestial nectar known as Nectar
<div n="lb"/>of Immortality (Amṛta) and to defeat the Asuras in
<div n="lb"/>battle. On the side of the Asuras there was the know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge of the Mṛtasañjīvanī (life-restoring remedy). So
<div n="lb"/>the dead were being brought to life. But it was not
<div n="lb"/>possible for devas to do so. It was to make up this
<div n="lb"/>deficiency, by obtaining Ambrosia from the sea, that
<div n="lb"/>the devas tried to churn the sea, under the pretence of
<div n="lb"/>recovering the lost wealth. Mention is made in the
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 9 and Matsya Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 250 and 251 that these events took place
<div n="lb"/>during the regime of the Indra named Mantradruma in
<div n="lb"/>the Cākṣuṣamanvantara (the period of the manu named
<div n="lb"/>Cākṣuṣa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%War with Indra.%} The great teacher Śukra again
<div n="lb"/>anointed Bali, who was brought to life again, as Indra.
<div n="lb"/>After that he performed the sacrifice of Viśvajit (con-
<div n="lb"/>queror of the world) on behalf of Bali. Assuming the
<div n="lb"/>responsibilities of government, Bali performed one
<div n="lb"/>hundred Aśvamedha yāgas (Horse sacrifices) (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>After the Viśvajit sacrifice, Yajñadeva (god of sacrifice)
<div n="lb"/>who was greatly pleased at the sacrifice, presented Bali
<div n="lb"/>with a divine chariot, equal in all aspects to that of
<div n="lb"/>Indra, a golden bow, two quivers, which would never
<div n="lb"/>become empty and a divine armour, and his grand-
<div n="lb"/>father gave him a garland that would never fade, and
<div n="lb"/>the teacher Śukra gave him a divine conch, and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>presented a garland. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 216).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Attainment of the Position of Indra.%} Mahāviṣṇu had
<div n="lb"/>not been on good terms with the devas, for a time.
<div n="lb"/>Taking this opportunity, Śukrācārya the teacher of the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, persuaded Bali to engage the devas in a battle.
<div n="lb"/>Bali defeated the devas completely in a pitched battle.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the realm of the gods came under the sway of
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali. Once, during that period Bali invited his
<div n="lb"/>grandfather Prahlāda to heaven and requested him to
<div n="lb"/>accept the most honourable seat there. Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>accepted his invitation and anointed Bali as Indra. Bali
<div n="lb"/>enquired of Prahlāda as to the method of carrying on
<div n="lb"/>the government of heaven. Prahlāda said thus in reply:
<div n="lb"/>“Only virtue will always win. Rule the kingdom without
<div n="lb"/>deviating from virtue.” (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 74).
<div n="lb"/>Because Bali had ruled his kingdom according to the
<div n="lb"/>advice of Prahlāda, he became famous in the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 75).
<div n="NI"/>According to the version of Bhāgavata, Prahlāda when
<div n="lb"/>he grew old, left his kingdom in the hands of his son
<div n="lb"/>Virocana and went to the forest for penance. Virocana
<div n="lb"/>was not as famous as Prahlāda. After the period of
<div n="lb"/>Virocana, Mahābali came to the throne. He was a
<div n="lb"/>mighty king. Within a short time he became the emperor
<div n="lb"/>of the Asuras. It was during this period that the churn-
<div n="lb"/>ing of the Milk Sea took place. The Asuras and the
<div n="lb"/>Devas (gods) sat on either side and using the mount
<div n="lb"/>Mandara as churn-drill, churned the Milk Sea and
<div n="lb"/>obtained Amṛta (the celestial nectar of immortality).
<div n="lb"/>A battle took place between the Asuras and the Devas
<div n="lb"/>for the possession of Amṛtakalaśa (the Ambrosia and
<div n="lb"/>the container) and the emperor Mahābali was killed in
<div n="lb"/>the battle. The Asuras carried the dead body of Mahā.
[Page104-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>bali to his capital, where Śukrācārya (their teacher-pri-
<div n="lb"/>est Śukra) brought him to life again by the help of sacred
<div n="lb"/>herbs. Mahābali instantly waged another war, fiercer
<div n="lb"/>than the previous ones, with the devas, and having
<div n="lb"/>defeated them, he drove them out of their realm and
<div n="lb"/>brought it under control. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The curse of Prahlāda.%} As the whole of heaven came
<div n="lb"/>under the sway of Bali, the devas began to leave the
<div n="lb"/>country one by one. Everybody was happy and comfort-
<div n="lb"/>able under the rule of Bali. But the devas and Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas were denied the privileges they deserved. They
<div n="lb"/>approached Viṣṇu and represented their grievances.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu told them thus: “Bali is devoted to me. Still, to
<div n="lb"/>redress your grievances I shall take the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana shortly.”
<div n="NI"/>In course of time the Asuras and their countries began
<div n="lb"/>to be weakened. Seeing the approach of destruction
<div n="lb"/>emperor Bali became thoughtful. He approached
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda to learn the reason. Prahlāda told Bali thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Lord Viṣṇu is now staying in the womb of Aditi for his
<div n="lb"/>incarnation as Vāmana. That is why the country and
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras are subjected to destruction. Hearing this
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali said: “Our Rākṣasas are more powerful
<div n="lb"/>than that Viṣṇu.” Hearing these haughty words of
<div n="lb"/>Bali, Prahlāda got angry and cursed Bali “Let your
<div n="lb"/>country be destroyed.” Bali requested Prahlāda to
<div n="lb"/>pardon him. Prahlāda advised Bali “You will get sal-
<div n="lb"/>vation only by relying on Viṣṇu”. (Vāmana Purāṇa 77).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Defeated by Vāmana.%} The defeated devas had taken
<div n="lb"/>refuge in forests. Aditi the mother of the devas was
<div n="lb"/>very sorry at this. She shed tears before her husband
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa Prajāpati, who advised his wife to take a fast
<div n="lb"/>of twelve days, and taught her the rules and rituals of
<div n="lb"/>the fast. Accordingly she took the fast, Viṣṇu appeared
<div n="lb"/>before her and asked her what boon she wanted. She
<div n="lb"/>requested Viṣṇu to take birth as her son, to drive away
<div n="lb"/>Bali and to restore her sons, the devas (gods), to their
<div n="lb"/>kingdom of heaven. Mahāviṣṇu agreed.
<div n="NI"/>Aditi became pregnant and gave birth to the son
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana. He was an incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. [The
<div n="lb"/>5th incarnation (avatāra) of Viṣṇu].
<div n="NI"/>At this time Mahābali was performing a sacrifice on the
<div n="lb"/>bank of the river Narmadā. Vāmana came to the place of
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice in the dress of a hermit boy and told Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>that he was a helpless hermit boy and requested that
<div n="lb"/>he might be given three steps of ground. Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>was pleased with the boy and told him that he was
<div n="lb"/>willing to give the boy even the country called Bhṛṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>raka and that he was prepared to forego the kingly
<div n="lb"/>pleasures for the boy. The hermit boy did not show any
<div n="lb"/>desire for them. So many gathered round them to
<div n="lb"/>witness this sight. The teacher Śukrācārya called Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bali and said that the boy was a cheat and that his
<div n="lb"/>request should not be granted. But Mahābali decided
<div n="lb"/>to grant the wish of the boy and as a token of his gift
<div n="lb"/>he began to offer the boy water from a waterpot. Then
<div n="lb"/>the teacher got into the mouth of the pot in the shape
<div n="lb"/>of a mote and water would not flow freely out of the
<div n="lb"/>mouth of the pot. Knowing this Vāmana took a grass
<div n="lb"/>of Darbha and pushed it at the mouth of the pot. The
<div n="lb"/>grass pierced one eye of Śukrācārya. From that time
<div n="lb"/>onwards Śukrācārya had only one eye. Water flowed
<div n="lb"/>freely into the hands of Vāmana. Śukra got angry and
<div n="lb"/>cursed Bali. Vāmana began to measure the ground
<div n="lb"/>and simultaneously began to grow. The asuras who were
[Page104-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>horrified at this, began to attack Vāmana with anything
<div n="lb"/>they could lay hands on. Still Vāmana was growing.
<div n="lb"/>Finally he became an immensely large being. With
<div n="lb"/>one step he measured the whole of earth and with the
<div n="lb"/>second step he took the whole of heaven. Then he
<div n="lb"/>asked Bali, where to place the third step. Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>said that he had only his body left, as his own, and
<div n="lb"/>that Vāmana might take it and complete three steps.
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana placed his foot on the head of Bali and pushed
<div n="lb"/>him down to Pātāla (the Netherworld). Thencefor-
<div n="lb"/>ward the asuras became the inhabitants of Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Bali and Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa visited Bali who
<div n="lb"/>was under custody in Pātāla, and said to him, “I have
<div n="lb"/>come to save you from here. So get yourself free from
<div n="lb"/>the custody of Mahāviṣṇu, with my help.” Hearing
<div n="lb"/>this, Bali asked Rāvaṇa to fetch the two earrings of
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu, which were shining like blazing fire
<div n="lb"/>a little away from them. Rāvaṇa moved forward to
<div n="lb"/>take them. But he fell unconscious. Bali caused him to
<div n="lb"/>recover and said: “These earrings were worn by my
<div n="lb"/>great grandfather Hiraṇyakaśipu. How could you,
<div n="lb"/>who are not even capable of taking his earrings, save
<div n="lb"/>me from his slayer, Viṣṇu? Viṣṇu is Almighty and
<div n="lb"/>All-powerful and Supreme Lord of everything.” Hear-
<div n="lb"/>ing this, Rāvaṇa was filled with shame and he returned.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, Prakṣipta Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bali born as a Gardabha (Ass).%} Bali, who was fallen
<div n="lb"/>from power took birth in the womb of an ass and
<div n="lb"/>roamed about. Brahmā instructed Indra to find out
<div n="lb"/>Bali. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapters 216-218).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other information.%}

<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once Mahābali went to Prahlāda and repented of
<div n="lb"/>his sins and begged for pardon. Then he began to make
<div n="lb"/>enquiries on spiritual matters. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 28, Stanza 3).
<div n="NI"/>(3) From his childhood Mahābali was a hater of the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 90, Stanza
