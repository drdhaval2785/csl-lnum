DRUHYU I¦. A son of King Yayāti. Two sons, Yadu

<div n="lb"/>by his wife Devayānī and three sons Druhyu, Anudru-
<div n="lb"/>hyu and Pūru by his wife Śarmiṣṭhā. Druhyu was cursed
<div n="lb"/>by his father because he did not comply with the re-
<div n="lb"/>quest of his father to exchange his old age with the
<div n="lb"/>youth of his son. The curse was that his desires
<div n="lb"/>would not be realized, that he would stay in places
<div n="lb"/>where he would not like to stay that his kingdom would
<div n="lb"/>be lost and that he would be called Bhoja. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti).
