DHARMAPUTRA¦. The eldest of the Pāṇḍavas, the
<div n="lb"/>others being Bhīmasena, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Pāṇḍu, brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, had two wives,
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī and Mādrī. There was a curse for Pāṇḍu that he
<div n="lb"/>would die the moment he touched his wife. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu). Kuntī, the first wife of Pāṇḍu, had obtained
<div n="lb"/>from Durvāsas five mantras. The mantras were very po-
<div n="lb"/>tent. If she called upon any god reciting the mantra that
<div n="lb"/>God would manifest himself to her and bless her with a
<div n="lb"/>son. When Kuntī found that Gāndhārī was pregnant and
<div n="lb"/>was about to deliver she became anxious and meditating
<div n="lb"/>on Dharmadeva recited one of the mantras given by Dur-
<div n="lb"/>vāsas and got a child from him. The boy was born at mid-
<div n="lb"/>day on the eighth Jyeṣṭha day of the year on Pañcamī
<div n="lb"/>and at the auspicious hour, Abhijit. At the time
<div n="lb"/>of his birth there was a celestial voice which said “This
<div n="lb"/>boy will become a very righteous and bold King, best
<div n="lb"/>among the virtuous. He will be known as Yudhiṣṭhira”.
<div n="lb"/>Obeying the dictate of the mysterious voice he was
<div n="lb"/>named Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 123).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Boyhood.%} When he had five sons Pāṇḍu went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>of Śataśṛṅga together with his family to spend the spring
<div n="lb"/>time there. The sages residing in that forest conducted
<div n="lb"/>the christening ceremony of Dharmaputra. Kaśyapa,
<div n="lb"/>priest of Vāsudeva, performed the Upanayana ceremony
<div n="lb"/>(thread-wearing) of Dharmaputra (Chapter 123, Dākṣi-
<div n="lb"/>ṇātyapāṭha) Ādi Parva, M.B.). Rājarṣi Śuka imparted
<div n="lb"/>instructions to Dharmaputra on spear-warfare. Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>died during their stay there. Mādrī abandoned her life
<div n="lb"/>by jumping into her husband's funeral pyre. Before
<div n="lb"/>doing so she called Dharmaputra to her side and join-
<div n="lb"/>ing her hands together said “Son, you are now the father
<div n="lb"/>to your brothers.” When Pāṇḍu and Mādrī were dead
<div n="lb"/>the sages of the forest took Kuntī and the children to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura and entrusted them to the care of Bhīṣma
[Page227-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>detailing to him all that had happened in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 125, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kaumāra (youth).%} Dharmaputra and his brothers spent
<div n="lb"/>their boyhood in Hastināpura along with Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>and his brothers. Bhīmasena became a great foe of
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana and his brothers and Duryodhana always
<div n="lb"/>nurtured a desire to kill Bhīmasena. Once Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>invited Dharmaputra and his brothers to have aquatic
<div n="lb"/>games in the Gaṅgā. Accepting the invitation Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra participated in the games along with his brothers.
<div n="lb"/>One night Duryodhana caught hold of Bhīma alone and
<div n="lb"/>tied him with ropes and threw him into the river. When in
<div n="lb"/>the morning Dharmaputra found his brother missing he
<div n="lb"/>ran to his mother to inform her of the loss. Kuntī asked
<div n="lb"/>him to start a search and while he was on it Bhīmasena
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and told him how he was thrown
<div n="lb"/>into the river by Duryodhana and how he went to
<div n="lb"/>Nāgaloka and was brought to earth with great acquisi-
<div n="lb"/>tions from there. Dharmaputra advised them not to
<div n="lb"/>make the incident public. They received training in
<div n="lb"/>warfare in Hastināpura under Droṇācārya. Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>got great proficiency in chariot-fighting. As Gurudakṣiṇā
<div n="lb"/>(fee for the preceptor) Dharmaputra agreed to bring
<div n="lb"/>Drupada bound before the preceptor. But Arjuna stop-
<div n="lb"/>ped him and himself undertook the task (Chapters 127
<div n="lb"/>to 136, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Becomes heir-apparent and goes to the forest.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb"/>crowned Dharmaputra as the heir-apparent when the
<div n="lb"/>latter had successfully completed his course of study in
<div n="lb"/>warfare. By his good conduct, righteousness and adminis-
<div n="lb"/>trative efficiency Dharmaputra excelled his father and be-
<div n="lb"/>came very popular among his subjects. Jealous of this
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana decided to destroy the Pāṇḍavas somehow.
<div n="lb"/>With the permission of his father, Duryodhana cons-
<div n="lb"/>tructed a palace at Vāraṇāvata for the Pāṇḍavas to
<div n="lb"/>reside there. That palace was built of Lākṣā (See
<div n="lb"/>under Arakkillam). The entire population resented
<div n="lb"/>this act of Duryodhana and rebuked him. They tried
<div n="lb"/>to follow Dharmaputra to Vāraṇāvata and stay there.
<div n="lb"/>But by tactful words he made them abandon that idea.
<div n="lb"/>Still many brahmins followed Dharmaputra. After some
<div n="lb"/>days Duryodhana set fire to the palace. But the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas escaped through a tunnel from the house which had
<div n="lb"/>been constructed without the knowledge of Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>just at the time of construction of the building. Escap-
<div n="lb"/>ing from there the Pāṇḍavas reached the forests and
<div n="lb"/>travelling farther came to the shore of the Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>(Ślokas 138 to 148, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Story up to the life incognito.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) When the palace was burnt to ashes it was presumed
<div n="lb"/>that they were dead and by the instructions of Dhṛtarā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭra the funeral rites of the Pāṇḍavas were conducted
<div n="lb"/>at Hastināpura. But Vidura informed Bhīṣma that the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were alive. (Chapter 149, Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dharmaputra gave permission to Bhīma to marry
<div n="lb"/>Hiḍiṃbā while they were in the forest. (Chapter 154,
<div n="lb"/>Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Dharmaputra counselled Arjuna to release Citraratha
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣa who was defeated by Arjuna in a battle. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>39, Chapter 169, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) After the svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī, Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>narrated to Drupada the story of their escape from
<div n="lb"/>the palace. (Chapter 194, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) After svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī the Pāṇḍavas returned
[Page227-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>to their country and Dharmaputra was crowned king
<div n="lb"/>of half of the country. He started his rule at Khāṇḍava-
<div n="lb"/>prastha, his capital. (Chapter 206, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Nārada went to Khāṇḍavaprastha and advised them,
<div n="lb"/>how to avoid unpleasantness accruing from their hav-
<div n="lb"/>ing one wife in common. His advice was that Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>should spend one year with each of the five in turn.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 207, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(7) When Abhimanyu was born to Arjuna, Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>gave ten thousand cows to brahmins as gifts. (Śloka 69,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 22, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Yudhiṣṭhira got a son Prativindhya of Pāñcāli.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 79, Chapter 220, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Yudhiṣṭhira got a son Yaudheya of Devikā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of King Śibi (Śloka 76, Chapter 95, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(10) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to Dvārakā from Indraprastha
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra drove the chariot in the place of Dāruka,
<div n="lb"/>charioteer of Kṛṣṇa. (Śloka 16, Chapter 2, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Mayāsura constructed a beautiful palace in
<div n="lb"/>Indraprastha and gave it to Dharmaputra. (Śloka 37,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Yudhiṣṭhira decided to perform a Rajasūya at Indra-
<div n="lb"/>prastha. Even before the Rājasūya Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Bhīmasena together killed Jarāsandha. After that
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira sent Arjuna to the northern side and the
<div n="lb"/>other brothers to the southern side for Digvijaya (con-
<div n="lb"/>quest of countries). When he established his autocracy
<div n="lb"/>he performed the Rājasūya. (Chapter 45, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Yudhiṣṭhira used to give free sumptuous food to
<div n="lb"/>thousands of brahmins in golden pots daily. (Chapter 49,
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Envious Duryodhana sent Vidura to bring Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra to Hastināpura and defeated him foully in a game
<div n="lb"/>of dice. Though Dharmaputra lost everything Dhṛtarā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭra gave him back everything. (Chapter 72, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(15) Before Dharmaputra went back to his place, with the
<div n="lb"/>permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana called him back
<div n="lb"/>again for another game of dice. Despite protests from
<div n="lb"/>all sides Dharmaputra went again for a game of dice
<div n="lb"/>with Duryodhana and lost again all he possessed. Then
<div n="lb"/>he left the country with his brothers and wife to spend
<div n="lb"/>twelve years in exile in the forests and another year
<div n="lb"/>incognito. (Chapter 79, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(16) Sūrya gave the Akṣayapātra (a pot which is never
<div n="lb"/>emptied) to the Pāṇḍavas. (Śloka 72, Chapter 3, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(17) At first the Pāṇḍavas stayed in Dvaitavana and
<div n="lb"/>later on the advice of Vyāsa they went to Kāmyakavana.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 41, Chapter 36, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(18) He advised Bhīmasena to remain quiet for thirteen
<div n="lb"/>years. (Chapter 52, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(19) Bṛhadaśva, the sage, narrated the story of Nala to
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra while they were in the forest. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>43, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(20) The sage Lomaśa imparted instructions on philoso-
<div n="lb"/>phy to Dharmaputra while they were in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 94, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(21) Yudhiṣṭhira met and conversed with Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>at the mountain Mahendra. (Chapter 117, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(22) The Pāṇḍavas then travelled in north India. On
<div n="lb"/>their way to the mountain of Gandhamādana Pāñcālī
[Page228-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>fainted and Yudhiṣṭhira wept bitterly. (Chapter 145,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(23) From Gandhamādana Dharmaputra with his wife
<div n="lb"/>and brothers reached Badarikāśrama and from there
<div n="lb"/>they returned to Dvaitavana.
<div n="NI"/>(24) When they went to Kāmyaka vana Śrī Kṛṣṇa visited
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra there. (Chapter 153. Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(25) Duryodhana and his followers made a grand march
<div n="lb"/>to Kāmyaka vana to see the Pāṇḍavas in sad plight
<div n="lb"/>and there the Gandharva Citrasena bound them all by
<div n="lb"/>ropes. Arjuna on the orders of Dharmaputra got them
<div n="lb"/>all released. (Chapter 246, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(26) While the Pāṇḍavas were in exile in the forest
<div n="lb"/>Duśśāsana went and invited Yudhiṣṭhira to attend a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇava sacrifice conducted by Duryodhana. But
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra sent him away saying that it was not
<div n="lb"/>proper to come to the country before the expiry of the
<div n="lb"/>period of exile. (Chapter 256, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(27) Yudhiṣṭhira received the sage Durvāsas with respect
<div n="lb"/>and after offering homage sent him away contented.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 262, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(28) Jayadratha kidnapped Pāñcālī and in the battle
<div n="lb"/>that ensued Dharmaputra slew the King of Trigartta
<div n="lb"/>but left free Jayadratha. (Chapter 272, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(29) At a time when Yudhiṣṭhira was plunged in sorrow
<div n="lb"/>the sage Mārkaṇḍeya narrated the story of Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>to console him. (Chapters 273 to 291, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How Dharmadava tested Yudhiṣṭhira.%} The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>travelling through the forests reached Dvaitavana. A
<div n="lb"/>brahmin among their group was making fire by the
<div n="lb"/>araṇi sticks when a deer rushed at him and took the
<div n="lb"/>araṇi sticks away, carrying them on its horns. The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas ran after the deer and they travelled far
<div n="lb"/>away from their place, still not getting scent of it. They
<div n="lb"/>were all tired and thirsty. Yudhiṣṭhira directed
<div n="lb"/>Nakula to climb on the top of a tree and investigate
<div n="lb"/>whether there was any water anywhere nearby. Nakula
<div n="lb"/>did so and reported that he could see a pond not far
<div n="lb"/>from the place where they were sitting. Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhira asked Nakula to go and fetch water. Nakula did
<div n="lb"/>not return for a long time and Sahadeva was asked to
<div n="lb"/>go and enquire. Sahadeva also did not return and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna was sent in search of them. When Arjuna did
<div n="lb"/>not return Bhīmasena went to enquire. Bhīmasena also
<div n="lb"/>did not return and finally Yudhiṣṭhira himself set out in
<div n="lb"/>search of them. On reaching the pond Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>was dumbfounded to see his brothers lying dead on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the pond. Weeping bitterly Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>entered the pond and to his surprise he heard a voice
<div n="lb"/>from the air addressed to him thus: “Ho, Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb"/>I am a stork living on the small fishes of this pond.
<div n="lb"/>This pond is my hereditary property. It was I who
<div n="lb"/>killed your brothers. I will ask you certain questions.
<div n="lb"/>If you answer them correctly you can drink from this
<div n="lb"/>pond. If not, you will also die.
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—“I do not believe that you are simply
<div n="lb"/>a bird. My brothers are renowned for their valour and
<div n="lb"/>have defeated not only the devas, dānavas, gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>and rākṣasas but also the four huge mountains like
<div n="lb"/>Himālaya Pāriyātra, Vindhya and Malaya. I am eager
<div n="lb"/>to know your true self who have slain such brave
<div n="lb"/>brothers of mine.”
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—“I am a Yakṣa and not merely a bird. I
<div n="lb"/>objected to your brothers' taking water from the pond.
[Page228-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>But waving aside my objections they started taking
<div n="lb"/>water from the pond and then I slew them. Now,
<div n="lb"/>hear my questions: Who carries the Sun? Who are his
<div n="lb"/>followers? Who makes the sun set? On whom does
<div n="lb"/>the sun exist?”
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—It is Brahman who carries the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>Devas are his followers. Dharma makes him set. He
<div n="lb"/>exists on Satya.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—How does Mahāsiddhi come to he Śrotriyas?
<div n="lb"/>(those who study the Vedas).
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira:—It happens by deep penance.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the reason for a brahmin getting divi-
<div n="lb"/>nity? What deed is equal to good conduct? What makes
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin mortal and what makes him evil?
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira:—The Brahmin gets divinity by medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion. Austerity is equal to good conduct. Death makes
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin mortal and abusive words make him evil.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the divinity of Kṣatriyas? What is
<div n="lb"/>equal to good nature? What makes them mortal and
<div n="lb"/>what makes them evil?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The divinity of a Kṣatriya is weapon.
<div n="lb"/>Sacrifice is equal to good conduct. Fear makes him
<div n="lb"/>mortal and non-sacrifice makes him evil.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the best thing for agriculture? What
<div n="lb"/>is the most important thing for agriculture? What are
<div n="lb"/>the installations of the atmosphere and child-birth?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The best thing for agriculture is rain.
<div n="lb"/>The important thing for agriculture is seed. The ins-
<div n="lb"/>tallation of atmosphere is rays and that of child-birth
<div n="lb"/>is child.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is lifeless even though he breathes?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—He who never offers oblations to a
<div n="lb"/>deva, a guest or a servant is like the dead even though
<div n="lb"/>he breathes.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is bigger than the earth? What is higher
<div n="lb"/>than the sky? What is swifter than the wind? What
<div n="lb"/>are greater in number than grass?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—Mother is bigger than the earth.
<div n="lb"/>Father is taller than the sky. Mind is swifter than the
<div n="lb"/>wind. Thoughts are greater in number than grass.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is it that does not shut its eyes when
<div n="lb"/>asleep? What is it that does not grow after birth? What
<div n="lb"/>is heartless? What grows very quickly?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—A fish does not shut its eyes when
<div n="lb"/>asleep. An egg does not grow after its birth. A stone
<div n="lb"/>is heartless. A river grows very quickly.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is a friend to one who lives outside his
<div n="lb"/>country? Who is a friend to a householder, to a patient
<div n="lb"/>and to one dead?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—For one who leaves his country the
<div n="lb"/>friend he gets on his way is the best friend. To a house-
<div n="lb"/>holder his wife is his friend, to a patient his doctor and
<div n="lb"/>to one dead, charity.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is a guest of all? What is Nectar? What
<div n="lb"/>is spread throughout the world?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—Agni (fire) is the guest of all. Moon
<div n="lb"/>(Candra) is the nectar. Air is that which is spread
<div n="lb"/>throughout the world.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who circles around solo? Who is born again?
<div n="lb"/>What is the remedy for cold? What gives the maximum
<div n="lb"/>yield?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The Sun circles solo. Candra is born
<div n="lb"/>again. Fire is the remedy for cold. Earth gives the
<div n="lb"/>maximum yield.
[Page229-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the soul of Man? Who is the com-
<div n="lb"/>panion given by God? What is Upajīvana?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The soul of Man is his son. The com-
<div n="lb"/>panion given by God is wife. Cloud is Upajīvana.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—How do you become rich? How do you be-
<div n="lb"/>come happy?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—If you abandon lust you will be rich.
<div n="lb"/>If you abandon desire you will be happy.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—By what is this world covered? By what does
<div n="lb"/>the world become clear? By what does one lose his
<div n="lb"/>friend? What is the obstacle for an entry into heaven?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—Dullness covers the world. World
<div n="lb"/>becomes clear by intelligence. A friend is lost by desire.
<div n="lb"/>Domestic ties stand in the way of getting into heaven.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who are those equal to the dead? Which
<div n="lb"/>country is dead?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—A poor penniless man is equal to the
<div n="lb"/>dead. The country where there is mob-rule is dead.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is a pandit? Who is an atheist? Who is
<div n="lb"/>wicked? What are lust and jealousy?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—A righteous man is a pandit. An
<div n="lb"/>atheist is wicked. Lust is the cause of worldly life.
<div n="lb"/>Jealousy is the cause of worry.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Though charity, wealth and lust are incom-
<div n="lb"/>patible with each other when do they unite together?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—When charity and wife compromise
<div n="lb"/>the above three blend together harmoniously.
<div n="NI"/>The Yakṣa was highly pleased with the replies given by
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra. He then offered to revive one of his bro-
<div n="lb"/>thers and asked Dharmaputra to name whom he should
<div n="lb"/>do so. Then Yudhiṣṭhira named Nakula. Yakṣa then
<div n="lb"/>enquired why he had named Nakula leaving aside Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Bhīma. Dharmaputra replied that though Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>and Mādrī were two wives of Pāṇḍu they were both
<div n="lb"/>mothers to them and so he wanted to see one of the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Mādrī alive. He therefore pressed the name of
<div n="lb"/>Nakula again. The Yakṣa who was none other than
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva was immensely happy to hear that reply
<div n="lb"/>and gave life to all his brothers. He confessed to
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira that it was he who in the form of a deer
<div n="lb"/>came and ran away with the araṇi sticks. He returned
<div n="lb"/>the araṇi sticks also. Dharmadeva then advised them
<div n="lb"/>to go and spend their life incognito at the court of King
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa blessing them with the assurance that they
<div n="lb"/>would never be found out during their life in disguise.
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva disappeared after this and the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>returned to their āśrama. (Chapters 312 and 313 of
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Ajñātavāsa (Life incognito).%} See under Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Dharmaputra and the great battle.%} Events relating
<div n="lb"/>to or involving Dharmaputra from the end of his life
<div n="lb"/>in disguise up to the end of the Mahābhārata battle
<div n="lb"/>are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(1) Yudhiṣṭhira tried utmost to avoid war but when it
<div n="lb"/>was made clear that the Pānḍavas would not be given
<div n="lb"/>even an inch of land, he decided to fight. So Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira prepared for a war and camped on one side of
<div n="lb"/>the Kurukṣetra with his army. (Chapter 196, Udyo-
<div n="lb"/>ga Parva)
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dharmaputra gave instructions to Arjuna to keep his
<div n="lb"/>army in vyūhas. (Śloka 6, Chapter 19, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Dharmaputra was sorry when he looked at the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>va army. (Śloka 3, Chapter 21, Bhīṣma Parva).
[Page229-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(4) Yudhiṣṭhira blew his conch Anantavijaya to announce
<div n="lb"/>the war. (Śloka 16, Chapter 25, Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Yudhiṣṭhira sought permission from Bhīṣma to fight

<div n="lb"/>ma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Yudhiṣṭhira bowed before Droṇācārya and sought
<div n="lb"/>permission to conduct the war. (Śloka 52, Chapter 43,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(7) He sought permission from Kṛpācārya to fight the
<div n="lb"/>war. (Śloka 69, Chapter 43, Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Yudhiṣṭhira went to Śalya and obtained his per-
<div n="lb"/>mission to conduct the war. (Śloka 78, Chapter 43,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Yudhiṣṭhira appealed to the warriors on the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>va side to join his army. Only Yuyutsu, responded to
<div n="lb"/>that beckoning and joined the Pāṇḍava's side. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>94, Chapter 43, Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(10) On the first day of the battle Dharmaputra fought

<div n="lb"/>and asked him how he should be killed. Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>attacked Bhīṣma as per the latter's instructions.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 107 to 115, Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(17) In the meantime Droṇācārya made a vow that he
<div n="lb"/>would capture Yudhiṣṭhira. So Yudhiṣṭhira thereafter,
<div n="lb"/>always kept Arjuna near at hand. (Śloka 3, Chapter 13,
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva).

<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(30) He killed the younger brother of Śalya. (Śloka 64,

<div n="NI"/>(31) Duryodhana at this time went to a lake in Dvai-
<div n="lb"/>pāyana and lay there immersed under water. Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira went there with an army and challenged him for a
<div n="lb"/>fight. (Śloka 18, Chapter 61, Śalya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(32) When Yudhiṣṭhira won the war he sent Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>to Hastināpura to console Gāndhārī. (Śloka 40, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 62, Śalya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Yudhiṣṭhira is crowned King.%} When Yudhiṣṭhira won
<div n="lb"/>the war he sent Nakula to bring Pāñcālī. He went
<div n="lb"/>round the Kurukṣetra battle ground and saw his own
<div n="lb"/>kith and kin lying dead and the sight made him faint.
<div n="lb"/>After that he went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Gāndhārī cursed
<div n="lb"/>him for killing her sons. Gāndhārī gave a piercing
<div n="lb"/>look at the nails on the foot of Dharmaputra when he
<div n="lb"/>stood before Gāndhārī bowing down, Instantly the
<div n="lb"/>nails turned black. Yudhiṣṭhira gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
<div n="lb"/>names of all the prominent persons who were killed in
<div n="lb"/>the war Dhṛtarāṣṭra ordered Yudhiṣṭhira to perform the
<div n="lb"/>obsequies of the dead. It was at this stage that Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>came to know from Kuntī that Karṇa was his brother.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira wept bitterly when he knew the secret from
<div n="lb"/>his mother and cursed womankind as a whole stating
<div n="lb"/>that woman would thereafter be incapable of keeping a
<div n="lb"/>secret to herself. The news of the death of Karṇa gave
<div n="lb"/>a sudden mental turn-back to Yudhiṣṭhira and he
<div n="lb"/>decided to renounce all and go to the forest. He
<div n="lb"/>called aside his followers and announced his decision to
<div n="lb"/>them. At that time Vyāsa came there and preached to
<div n="lb"/>him about the perishable nature of life. Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>then asked him what he should do for the atonement
<div n="lb"/>of the sins committed. Though he strongly desired to
<div n="lb"/>go to the forest Vyāsa and Śrī Kṛṣṇa did not allow him
<div n="lb"/>to do so and sent them all to Hastināpura. When the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas entered the city the people gave them a
<div n="lb"/>rousing reception and Yudhiṣṭhira was crowned King.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 10 to 17 of Sauptika Parva, Chapters 12 to
<div n="lb"/>27 Strī Parva, Chapters 1 to 40 Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Administration.%} When Yudhiṣṭhira became King,
<div n="lb"/>with the permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, he distributed the
<div n="lb"/>various administrative responsibilities among his bro-
<div n="lb"/>thers. He took for himself the task of taking care of
<div n="lb"/>their kith and kin and friends. He gave many gifts to
<div n="lb"/>the brahmins and other dependants. He once went to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa to express his gratitude for him. He visited
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma lying on his bed of arrows accompanied by
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and his brothers. Bhīṣma revealed to him
<div n="lb"/>the inner import of Rājadharma, Āpaddharma and
<div n="lb"/>Mokṣadharma. Receiving the blessings of Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers returned to Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira went to the Himālayas to get riches from
<div n="lb"/>Marutta before performing an Aśvamedha Sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>While on his way to the Himālayas he fasted for a night
<div n="lb"/>and worshipped Śiva. People like Vyāsa and Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>partook in the sacrifice. After the sacrifice was over
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra desired to go to forest and sought the
<div n="lb"/>approval of Yudhiṣṭhira to do so. On hearing that
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira wept. But on the advice of Vyāsa he gave his
<div n="lb"/>approval for Dhṛtarāṣṭra to go to forest. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>appealed to him through Vidura for funds to perform the
<div n="lb"/>obsequies of the dead. Bhīma objected to this but
[Page230-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira reprimanded him and silenced him and
<div n="lb"/>gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra enough funds for his purposes. Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>and Gāndhārī accompanied Dhṛtarāṣṭra to the forest.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira accompanied by Pāñcālī and Sahadeva
<div n="lb"/>went and saw them in the forests after a few days.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 41 to 55, Śānti Parva, Chapters 92 from
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva and Aśvamedha Parva and Chapter
<div n="lb"/>26 from Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Vidura merges into Dharmaputra.%} When Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī and Kuntī went to forest Vidura also accepted
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsa and left for the forest. There sitting under a
<div n="lb"/>tree he started doing penance. After a few days Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira came to the forest to see his mother and others.
<div n="lb"/>After spending some time with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>and Kuntī he went to the place where Vidura was
<div n="lb"/>doing penance. Vidura started running the moment he
<div n="lb"/>set eyes on Yudhiṣṭhira and the latter ran after him.
<div n="lb"/>After some time Vidura turned back and stood staring
<div n="lb"/>at Yudhiṣṭhira. At that time the soul of Vidura escap-
<div n="lb"/>ing from his body merged with that of Yudhiṣṭhira.
<div n="lb"/>The body of Vidura stood stiff and leaned against a tree.
<div n="lb"/>Taking him to be dead Yudhiṣṭhira started to do the
<div n="lb"/>funeral rites and then there resounded a voice from
<div n="lb"/>heaven saying that Vidura was not dead. The unknown
<div n="lb"/>voice was from Dharmadeva. When the voice subsided
<div n="lb"/>Vidura became his old self again. Yudhiṣṭhira went
<div n="lb"/>back. (Chapter 26, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%The end of Dharmaputra.%} Soon after his return from
<div n="lb"/>the forest Nārada came to Hastināpura and told him of
<div n="lb"/>the death of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kuntī and Gāndhārī in a
<div n="lb"/>wild fire in the forest. Lamenting deeply Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>performed the obsequies at Hastināpura. It was at
<div n="lb"/>this time that the Yādava dynasty perished and Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>was sunk into the ocean. The Pāṇḍavas then crowned
<div n="lb"/>Parīkṣit as their successor and entrusted Yuyutsu with
<div n="lb"/>the administration of the State till Parīkṣit came of age.
<div n="lb"/>Vajra was appointed as chief of Indraprastha. The
<div n="lb"/>obsequies of Vāsudeva, Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa were per-
<div n="lb"/>formed at Hastināpura. Kṛpācārya was appointed as
<div n="lb"/>preceptor to Parīkṣit. After having made all such
<div n="lb"/>arrangements the Pāṇḍavas commenced their Mahāpras-
<div n="lb"/>thāna. The five Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālī started from
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura. A dog also followed them. Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>walked ahead. On the way, one by one, Pāñcālī Saha-
<div n="lb"/>deva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bhīmasena fell dead. Alone
<div n="lb"/>with a dog to keep company, Yudhiṣṭhira reached a
<div n="lb"/>plateau on the top of the Himālayas and there Indra
<div n="lb"/>was waiting for him with a chariot. But Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>said that he would not come to heaven without his
<div n="lb"/>wife and brothers. He was then informed that they had
<div n="lb"/>already reached heaven. Yudhiṣṭhira insisted that the
<div n="lb"/>dog also should be taken to heaven which Indra
<div n="lb"/>blankly refused. But Yudhiṣṭhira refused to ascend the
<div n="lb"/>chariot without the dog which, he said, had given him
<div n="lb"/>company from the start to the finish. The dog then
<div n="lb"/>changed itself into Dharmadeva and he complimented
<div n="lb"/>him on his sense of justice. When Yudhiṣṭhira entered
<div n="lb"/>heaven he saw Duryodhana sitting in all luxury and glory.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira did not like it but Nārada pacified him.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira saw all his relatives sitting there. A devadūta
<div n="lb"/>took him round hell also. When he heard the pitiable
<div n="lb"/>groans from there Yudhiṣṭhira thought his right place
<div n="lb"/>was with them. But Indra and Dharmadeva again con-
<div n="lb"/>soled him. He was given a bath in Ākāśagaṅgā. He then
<div n="lb"/>lost his mortal form and his soul entered Divyaloka.
[Page231-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Standing in the form of Dharmadeva he saw all his
<div n="lb"/>relatives including Kṛṣṇa. (Chapters 38 and 39,
<div n="lb"/>Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 1, Mausala Parva;
<div n="lb"/>Mahāprasthānika Parva, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
