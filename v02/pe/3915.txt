KUŚAPLAVA¦ (KUŚAPLAVANAM). A holy place. He
<div n="lb"/>who bathes and spends three nights there will derive
[Page447-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the benefits of an aśvamedha yajña. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 12, Verse 21). It was here that Ditidevī, wife
<div n="lb"/>of Kaśyapa did tapas for a son who would be equal to
<div n="lb"/>Indra. Again it was here that Indra entered into the
<div n="lb"/>womb of Diti and cut into pieces the child in the
<div n="lb"/>womb. Kuśaplava became famous because of the above
<div n="lb"/>happenings. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto
<div n="lb"/>46).
