PAÑCĀPSARAS¦. A lake of distinction. During the exile
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Rāma in the forests, Agastya showed Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>this lake and described its origin thus: “In times of old
<div n="lb"/>a sage named Māṇḍakarṇi built this lake. This sage
<div n="lb"/>living on air alone stood in the waters of this lake and
<div n="lb"/>practised severe austerities for ten thousand years.
<div n="lb"/>Devas were frightened by the rigorous penance of
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍakarṇi and they sent five devakanyakās (celestial
<div n="lb"/>damsels) to the earth to entice the sage and stop his
<div n="lb"/>penance. Tke sage was attracted by the divine beauty
<div n="lb"/>of the girls and he lived with them in a grand building
<div n="lb"/>constructed within the lake itself. Even after the passing
<div n="lb"/>away of the sage and the damsels people used to hear
<div n="lb"/>dance and music from inside the lake. Because five
<div n="lb"/>apsaras lived in that lake it became known as Pañcā-
<div n="lb"/>psaras.
<div n="NI"/>(Apsaras = celestial damsels who are servants of Indra).
<div n="NI"/>(Sarga 1, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
