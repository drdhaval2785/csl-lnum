AGNI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Agni was descended from Viṣṇu in this
<div n="lb"/>order: Viṣṇu-Brahmā-Aṅgiras-Bṛhaspati-Agni.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} We come across several contradictory state-
<div n="lb"/>ments in the Purāṇas regarding the birth of Agni. There
<div n="lb"/>is some real difficulty, therefore, in tracing correctly
<div n="lb"/>the true genealogy of Agni. The one given above is
<div n="lb"/>based on statements in Bhāgavata and Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras is one of the six mind-born sons of Brahmā.
<F>*) Manas=Mind. Putra=Son. Mānasa-putras are sons created from the mind of Brahmā, Śloka 10, Chapter 65, Ādi Parva, M.B.</F>
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras married Śraddhā and got four daughters and
<div n="lb"/>two sons. Bṛhaspati was one of the sons and Utatthya
<div n="lb"/>was the other. The daughters were Sinīvālī, Kuhū,
<div n="lb"/>Rākā and Anumati. (There is a mention of a third
<div n="lb"/>son named Saṃvarta in the Bhāgavata by Eluthassan
<div n="lb"/>though the original quoted below does not say so)
<Poem>Śraddhā tu aṅgirasaḥ patnī
<div n="lb"/>Catasro’ sutakanyakāḥ
<div n="lb"/>Sinīvālī Kuhū Rākā
<div n="lb"/>Caturthya’ anumatistathā
<div n="lb"/>Tatputrāvaparāvāstām
<div n="lb"/>Khyātau svārocise'ntare
<div n="lb"/>Utatthyo bhagavān sākṣāt
<div n="lb"/>Brahmiṣṭhaśca Bṛhaspatiḥ.</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati married Cāndramasī and got six divine sons.
<div n="NI"/>Of these Saṃyu, the eldest, married Satyā and Agni
<div n="lb"/>was born to Saṃyu of Satyā. (Ślokas 1 to 4, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>219, Āraṇya Kāṇḍa of Malayālam Mahābhārata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Agni—One of the Aṣṭa-dik-pālakas.%} (Aṣṭa=eight,
<div n="lb"/>dik=zone, pālaka=guardian). The Devī Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>states in its eighth chapter that Agni is one of the eight
<div n="lb"/>guards posted at the eight different zones to protect
<div n="lb"/>the universe. Indra guards the east; Agni, the south-
<div n="lb"/>east; Yama the south; Nirṛti, the south-west; Varuṇa,
<div n="lb"/>the west; Vāyu, the north-west; Kubera, the North and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, the north-east. The place where Agni sits on
<div n="lb"/>guard is known as tejovatī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Agni—One of the five elements.%} The universe is be-
<div n="lb"/>lieved to be composed of five elements of which Agni
<div n="lb"/>is one. The other four are Water, Earth, Ether and
<div n="lb"/>Air.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The story of how Agni gave a Māyā Sītā (Phantom%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Sītā) to Śrī Rāma.%} During their exile in the forests
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were for some time living in an
<div n="lb"/>āśrama built on the shores of the ocean. One day
<div n="lb"/>Agni disguised as a Brāhmin approached them and
<div n="lb"/>said “O, Śrī Rāma, thou art born to kill the demon
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and save the world from his atrocities. Sītā is
<div n="lb"/>going to be a cause for that. Time is not far for you
<div n="lb"/>to finish this duty of yours. Rāvaṇa is soon to come and
<div n="lb"/>kidnap your wife, Sītā. You must, therefore, allow me
<div n="lb"/>to play a trick on Rāvaṇa. Entrust Sītā with me and
<div n="lb"/>I shall keep her safe. In her place here you can keep
<div n="lb"/>a Māyā Sītā. (Phantom Sītā) which will be a live rep-
<div n="lb"/>lica of your real wife. In the end when you take back
<div n="lb"/>Sītā after killing Rāvaṇa you will be compelled to
<div n="lb"/>throw your wife into the fire to test her chastity. At
[Page011-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>that time I will take back the replica and give you
<div n="lb"/>back your real wife”. Śrī Rāma was very much
<div n="lb"/>pleased to hear this. Agni then, by his yogic powers
<div n="lb"/>created a Phantom Sītā and gave her to him. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>kept this as a secret even from Lakṣmaṇa. In the great
<div n="lb"/>Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle Rāvaṇa was killed and Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>took back Sītā to his kingdom. Then respecting public
<div n="lb"/>opinion and wishing to establish in public the purity
<div n="lb"/>of his queen King Śrī Rāma put her into the fire. At
<div n="lb"/>that moment Agni took back the replica and gave
<div n="lb"/>back the real Sītā to Śrī Rāma. Sītā thus came out
<div n="lb"/>from the fire unscathed. Later, on the advice of Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Agni, the Phantom Sītā went to the sacred place
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkara and started doing tapas (penance) there.
<div n="lb"/>After doing tapas for a long period of three lakhs of
<div n="lb"/>divine years this Phantom Sītā became known as
<div n="lb"/>Svargalakṣmī. It was this Svargalakṣmī that later on
<div n="lb"/>in the Dvāpara yuga came out from the yajña kuṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>of King Pāñcāla as Pāñcālī and became the consort of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. Vedavatī, daughter of Kuśadhvaja in
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtayuga, Sītā, daughter of Janaka in the Treta yuga,
<div n="lb"/>and Pāñcālī, daughter of Drupada in Dvāpara yuga
<div n="lb"/>are one and the same person. On account of this she
<div n="lb"/>is known as trihāyanī also. (Chapter 9 of Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The story of how Agni got indigestion.%} In olden times
<div n="lb"/>there was a bold and mighty King called Śvetaki. He
<div n="lb"/>conducted several different types of yajña. Afflicted
<div n="lb"/>by the unending dense smoke in the yajña hall all the
<div n="lb"/>ascetics left the place and went their way. Undaunted
<div n="lb"/>by this, Śvetaki started another twelve-year sacrifice in
<div n="lb"/>which not a single sage took part. The sages rebuked
<div n="lb"/>him and said if he wanted to conduct a sacrifice again
<div n="lb"/>he could invite śūdras to help him. (Śūdras belong
<div n="lb"/>to the lowest caste among Hindus and are not allow-
<div n="lb"/>ed to participate in sacrifices generally.) Enraged
<div n="lb"/>by this insult Śvetaki went to Kailāsa and did fierce
<div n="lb"/>penance. Lord Śiva appeared before him and gave him
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas as a priest for his yajña. For twelve years
<div n="lb"/>sage Durvāsas performed the yajña pouring into
<div n="lb"/>the mouth of Agni through the sacrificial pit un-
<div n="lb"/>limited materials of food. Agni was overfed and
<div n="lb"/>he got indigestion. He lost all appetite for food, be-
<div n="lb"/>came weak and the brilliance of his face faded.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 235, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The story of how Agni burnt the big forest, Khāṇḍava.%}
<div n="lb"/>When the indigestion continued without abate for some
<div n="lb"/>time Agni approached Brahmā and asked for a cure.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā declared that his indigestion would be cured
<div n="lb"/>if Agni could burn the huge forest, Khāṇḍava, the
<div n="lb"/>abode of the enemies of the Devas. Agni immediately
<div n="lb"/>started consuming the forest. But the inhabitants of the
<div n="lb"/>forest soon quenched the fire. Disappointed Agni went
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmā again and the latter advised him to wait for
<div n="lb"/>some time till the advent of Nara-Nārāyaṇas to that
<div n="lb"/>forest. They would then help Agni to burn the forest.
<div n="lb"/>Agni waited for the time to come. At that time the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were living in Indraprastha with Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>When the heat became unbearable there Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa came to the banks of river Yamunā. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>about the arrival of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who were none
<div n="lb"/>but the incarnations of Nārāyaṇa and Nara, Agni dis-
<div n="lb"/>guised as a brahmin approached them and requested
<div n="lb"/>them to help him to burn the Khāṇḍava forest. Agni
<div n="lb"/>added that any attempt of his to burn the forest was
[Page011-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>always foiled by Indra who would send a heavy down-
<div n="lb"/>pour of rain to quench the fire because Takṣaka, an
<div n="lb"/>intimate friend of Indra, was living there.
<div n="NI"/>To gain his end Agni gave Arjuna an arrow-case
<div n="lb"/>which would never be empty, a chariot bearing a
<div n="lb"/>monkey flag, four white horses adorned with gold
<div n="lb"/>chains and also the famous Gāṇḍīva bow. To Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>he gave the cakrāyudha or the divine wheel-weapon.
<div n="lb"/>(All these military equipments were once given to
<div n="lb"/>Agni by Varuṇa.) When all these were given to them
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna got ready to help Agni to burn the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Agni started burning the forest, Indra at once
<div n="lb"/>sent a heavy downpour of rain and Arjuna created a
<div n="lb"/>canopy of arrows above the forest preventing the rains
<div n="lb"/>from falling on the forest. Agni carried on his work
<div n="lb"/>undisturbed, the forest was burnt and Agni was cured
<div n="lb"/>of his indigestion. (Ślokas 233 to 239, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Agni falls in love.%} As an inaugural procedure to the
<div n="lb"/>great Rājasūya which Dharmaputra performed at
<div n="lb"/>Indraprastha his four brothers Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula
<div n="lb"/>and Sahadeva conducted a victory march to the four
<div n="lb"/>different sides of the kingdom. Sahadeva who turned
<div n="lb"/>south conquered many kings including Dantavaktra
<div n="lb"/>and Bhīṣmaka and reached a country called Māhiṣmatī-
<div n="lb"/>pura. There he had to encounter a powerful king
<div n="lb"/>called Nīla. Before long there broke a fire in his camp.
<div n="lb"/>Disheartened, Sahadeva prayed to the God, Agni, for
<div n="lb"/>help. It was then that Sahadeva came to know about
<div n="lb"/>the ties between Agni and Nīla.
<div n="NI"/>King Nīla had a beautiful daughter named Sudarśanā.
<div n="lb"/>Once when she was talking to her father after having
<div n="lb"/>entered the Agni-hotra Agni fell in love with her. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards Agni became dreamy about the
<div n="lb"/>beautiful lips of Sudarśanā. It reached a stage when
<div n="lb"/>Agni would burn only if it was blown by the lips of
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśanā. This ended in Agni marrying Sudarśanā.
<div n="lb"/>After the marriage Agni lived in the palace of his
<div n="lb"/>father-in-law, King Nīla, as a useful ally. It was at this
<div n="lb"/>time that Sahadeva came to conquer Nīla. But Agni
<div n="lb"/>knew that for the proper conduct of the Rājasūya of
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra his father-in-law had to surrender to
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva and so advised his father-in-law to do so.
<div n="lb"/>What appeared to be a difficult problem was thus
<div n="lb"/>easily solved. (Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%How Emperor Śibi was tested by Agni.%} Once Agni and
<div n="lb"/>Indra thought of testing how strong and deep was the
<div n="lb"/>sense of charity in Emperor Śibi. Indra took the shape
<div n="lb"/>of a hawk and Agni that of a dove and the dove flew
<div n="lb"/>and dropped down into the lap of the Emperor who
<div n="lb"/>was at that time doing a yāga. The hungry hawk
<div n="lb"/>came chasing its prey and finding the dove in the lap
<div n="lb"/>of the Emperor said: “O King, is it proper on your
<div n="lb"/>part to withhold my food from me, and keep it in your
<div n="lb"/>lap?” Hearing this Śibi replied: “This dove has sought
<div n="lb"/>refuge in me. It is my duty to give it protection. If it
<div n="lb"/>is only food you want I shall give you food.” Śibi then
<div n="lb"/>offered many things including his kingdom to the
<div n="lb"/>hawk in return for the dove. But the hawk refused
<div n="lb"/>them all and finally agreed to accept an equal weight
<div n="lb"/>of flesh from the body of the Emperor. Śibi without
<div n="lb"/>any hesitation cut a portion of his thigh and weighed
<div n="lb"/>it against the dove in a scale. The dove weighed more
<div n="lb"/>and the Emperor started putting more and more flesh
<div n="lb"/>from his body to make the weight equal. But the dove
[Page012-a+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>always weighed more and at last the Emperor said he
<div n="lb"/>would weigh himself against the dove. As the weak and
<div n="lb"/>fleshless Emperor was about to get into the pan of the
<div n="lb"/>scale Agni and Indra emerged from the bodies of the
<div n="lb"/>dove and hawk and appeared before the Emperor.
<div n="lb"/>They blessed him and immediately took him to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 131, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Agni and the testicles of a goat.%} The occasion is when
<div n="lb"/>sage Viśvāmitra is taking Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to the
<div n="lb"/>forests to give protection to the sages against the de-
<div n="lb"/>mons. They reached the place where Ahalyā lay as a
<div n="lb"/>stone cursed by Gautama. Viśvāmitra told them the
<div n="lb"/>story: “It was here that the great sage, Gautama, lived
<div n="lb"/>with his beautiful consort, Ahalyā. Once Indra had an
<div n="lb"/>intercourse with her privately and Gautama coming to
<div n="lb"/>know of the misdeed cursed her and turned her into
<div n="lb"/>stone. By the curse of the same sage Indra lost his
<div n="lb"/>testicles. Greatly aggrieved by this loss Indra prayed
<div n="lb"/>to god Agni for help and on the advice of Agni the
<div n="lb"/>devas removed the deformity by placing a goat's testi-
<div n="lb"/>cles instead.” (Ślokas 48 & 49, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%How sage Bhṛgu cursed Agni.%} Sage Bhṛgu was living
<div n="lb"/>with his wife Pulomā in his āśrama. Pulomā became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant. One day when Bhṛgu wanted to go out for
<div n="lb"/>a bath in the river he asked Agni to keep a watch over
<div n="lb"/>his pregnant wife. There was a demon by name
<div n="lb"/>Puloma who was once in love with Pulomā. On this
<div n="lb"/>particular day Puloma entered the āśrama to see
<div n="lb"/>his former love. When he entered the āśrama Puloma
<div n="lb"/>saw Agni there burning with a brilliant flame in the
<div n="lb"/>fire-pit. Puloma said: “O God of fire, if I ask you a
<div n="lb"/>question you must give me an impartial reply. I was
<div n="lb"/>in love with this Pulomā and I had accepted her as
<div n="lb"/>my wife spiritually. But, then, her father gave her to
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu. Who, then, is the true owner of Pulomā?”
<div n="lb"/>Agni was afraid of Bhṛgu. Yet he explained the posi-
<div n="lb"/>tion honestly. “It is true that Pulomā has married
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu. But he has not married her according to Hindu
<div n="lb"/>rites.” Hearing this the demon changed himself into
<div n="lb"/>the shape of a swine and carried away Pulomā. On
<div n="lb"/>the way Pulomā delivered a male babe and it fell on
<div n="lb"/>the ground. The boy was named Cyavana. It was this
<div n="lb"/>boy that became later on the famous Cyavana Maha-
<div n="lb"/>rṣi. Even at birth the boy was brilliant as the Sun
<div n="lb"/>to look at and Puloma, the demon, noticing the un-
<div n="lb"/>usual brilliance of the child left the mother and child
<div n="lb"/>on the way and fled frightened. Pulomā returned to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama carrying the child weeping profusely all the
<div n="lb"/>way and creating a lachrymal river called Vadhū-
<div n="lb"/>saras. As soon as she entered the āśrama the angry
<div n="lb"/>sage asked “Who told Puloma that you are my wife?”
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā then told her husband all that happened there
<div n="lb"/>and Bhṛgu called Agni and cursed him thus: “May
<div n="lb"/>you be a consumer of all things on this Earth”. Great-
<div n="lb"/>ly aggrieved Agni went away and hid himself. The
<div n="lb"/>absence of Agni created chaos in all the three worlds;
<div n="lb"/>Heaven, Earth and the Nether-world. A deputation of
<div n="lb"/>all the afflicted people waited upon Brahmā and
[Page012-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā modified the curse and declared that all that
<div n="lb"/>Agni touched would become pure. Agni was consoled
<div n="lb"/>and he started his work as usual.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%How Agni cursed frogs, birds and elephants.%} Many
<div n="lb"/>important events took place while Agni was under-
<div n="lb"/>ground cursed by Bhṛgu. It was during that time that
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī cursed all the Devas and the Devas were
<div n="lb"/>defeated by the asuras (demons). The necessity of a
<div n="lb"/>warrior capable of defeating the asuras arose then.
<div n="lb"/>The idea of creating Lord Subrahmaṇya came up and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā said that only Agni could help them in this
<div n="lb"/>matter since Agni was the only one who escaped from
<div n="lb"/>the curse of Pārvatī, being underground at the time
<div n="lb"/>of the curse. The Devas started a vigilant search but
<div n="lb"/>Agni was not to be found. Agni was then hiding inside
<div n="lb"/>the ocean. The ocean was getting hot and the animals
<div n="lb"/>living there found their life unbearable. Frogs went to
<div n="lb"/>the devas and told them where Agni was hiding.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this Agni cursed the frogs saying that they
<div n="lb"/>would never be able to find the taste of anything.
<div n="lb"/>Frogs went weeping to the devas who in turn blessed
<div n="lb"/>the frogs saying that they would acquire the ability to
<div n="lb"/>move about easily in any darkness. Agni changed his
<div n="lb"/>place of hiding and went and hid in a big banyan
<div n="lb"/>tree. An elephant going by that way found him out
<div n="lb"/>and informed the devas; knowing this Agni cursed
<div n="lb"/>the elephants saying that its tongue would go deep
<div n="lb"/>inside. But the devas blessed the elephants saying that
<div n="lb"/>the position of the tongue would never be a hindrance
<div n="lb"/>to free eating and that elephants would be able to eat
<div n="lb"/>anything and everything. Agni left the banyan tree
<div n="lb"/>and hid himself in the hollow of a Śamī tree. A little
<div n="lb"/>bird living in that tree gave information to the devas
<div n="lb"/>and the devas found him out before he got time to
<div n="lb"/>leave the place. Agni cursed the bird saying that its
<div n="lb"/>tongue would always be curved inside and the devas
<div n="lb"/>blessed it saying that the curvature would help it to
<div n="lb"/>sing beautiful songs. Since Agni was found out from
<div n="lb"/>Śamī tree this tree became sacred. Since this finding
<div n="lb"/>out of Agni after a long absence is like a re-birth of
<div n="lb"/>Agni the Purāṇas mention that Agni was born from
<div n="lb"/>the Śamī tree. The Devas then requested Agni to help
<div n="lb"/>them to create a son capable of conquering the de-
<div n="lb"/>mons.
<F>*) Kathāsaritsāgara gives another version of why Agni went and hid himself under the ocean. When Kāma, the God of Love, was
<div n="lb"/>burnt to death by Śiva, Pārvatī, Śivā's wife, did not find a way to get a child for her from her husband. At last Brahmā approached Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>told him that the absence of Kāma was making creation difficult. Śiva then declared that thereafter Kāma would find a place in the minds of all
<div n="lb"/>living beings including himself. Pārvatī and Śiva immediately commenced a sexual life which went on incessantly for a hundred years with-
<div n="lb"/>out reaching the climax. The world was agitated and the universe stood on the verge of ruin. The Devas decided to send Agni to intervene But
<div n="lb"/>Agni was afraid of Śiva and so went and bid himself under the ocean. (Chapter 6, Lāvāṇakalambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara).</F> (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Birth of Subrahmaṇya.%} At that time Varuṇa performed
<div n="lb"/>a yāga. All the dikpālakas (zone guardians of the
<div n="lb"/>universe) including Śiva participated in the yāga.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the beautiful wives of the sages Śiva had emission.
<div n="lb"/>Taking the semen in his hand he put it into the fire.
<div n="lb"/>Agni carried it to Gaṅgā and requested her to take it
<div n="lb"/>for conception. Though she at first refused she took it,
<div n="lb"/>became pregnant and finally delivered a male child
<div n="lb"/>whom she threw into the forest Śaravaṇa. It was this
<div n="lb"/>child who became known as Kārttikeya or Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya later on. (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%How Agni blessed Nala.%} While Nala was going to the
<div n="lb"/>wedding of Damayantī Indra, Agni, Varuṇa and Kāla
<div n="lb"/>accosted him on his way and asked him to go as a
<div n="lb"/>messenger of theirs and advise Damayantī to marry one
[Page013-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of them. Nala did so but Damayantī was adamant and
<div n="lb"/>said she would marry none other than Nala. So all the
<div n="lb"/>four gods appeared as Nala in the wedding hall.
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī who was confused prayed that she should
<div n="lb"/>be shown the real Nala. The gods then changed into
<div n="lb"/>their original forms and blessed Nala. Agni said he
<div n="lb"/>would come and help him the moment he wanted him.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Nala became a good cook and Nala Pācakaṃ
<div n="lb"/>(Pācakaṃ=cooking) became famous. Even now it is a
<div n="lb"/>synonym for good cooking. (Chapter 57, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B)
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Agni and Raṃbhā.%} There was once a dānava called
<div n="lb"/>Danu. He had two sons named Raṃbha and Karaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>bha. They had no children and tormented by this
<div n="lb"/>they went to Pañcanada and started doing penance.
<div n="lb"/>Raṃbha sat in the centre of Pañcāgni (five fires) and
<div n="lb"/>Karaṃbha in water to do penance. Indra afraid of the
<div n="lb"/>severe and powerful tapas of the two took the form of
<div n="lb"/>a crocodile and killed Karaṃbha who was doing pe-
<div n="lb"/>nance in water by dragging him down to the water. Be-
<div n="lb"/>reaved Raṃbha started to commit suicide by jumping
<div n="lb"/>into the fire. God Agni appeared before him then and
<div n="lb"/>asked him what he wanted. Raṃbha then said that he
<div n="lb"/>should get a son who would be famous as a warrior in
<div n="lb"/>all the three worlds. Agni agreed. Raṃbha on his way
<div n="lb"/>back saw a voluptuous she-buffalo and married her
<div n="lb"/>at yakṣa kavāṭa. They lived a happy married life and
<div n="lb"/>one day a he-buffalo envious of their life attacked
<div n="lb"/>Raṃbha and killed him. Grief-stricken Raṃbha's wife
<div n="lb"/>jumped into the funeral pyre and committed suicide.
<div n="lb"/>Then from the fire arose a demon named Mahiṣāsura
<div n="lb"/>(Mahiṣa=Buffalo. Asura=Demon). This buffalo-
<div n="lb"/>demon became a terror to all in the three worlds later
<div n="lb"/>on. (Chapter 5, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Difference of opinion between Agni and Aṅgiras.%} Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vān Aṅgiras did penance in his own āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>became more brilliant than Agni. The whole world
<div n="lb"/>was submerged in his brilliance. Agni felt a bit depress-
<div n="lb"/>ed at this. Agni argued that it was not proper on the
<div n="lb"/>part of Brahmā to give anybody else more brilliance
<div n="lb"/>than himself. So as a protest against this Agni dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared from the world. Even Aṅgiras was annoyed at
<div n="lb"/>Agni's disappearance and so he went and consoled Agni
<div n="lb"/>and took him to Brahmā. Brahmā declared that hence-
<div n="lb"/>forth the world world recognize Agni as the father and
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras as his son. Thus Agni got the first place in
<div n="lb"/>effulgence. This is a story told by sage Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>to Dharmaputra. (Chapter 217, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Agni and Mahābali.%} On their way to the forest sage
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Siddhāśrama.
<div n="lb"/>The sage explained to the princes the importance of
<div n="lb"/>that āśrama. He said: “Mahāviṣṇu lived in this āśrama
<div n="lb"/>for a number of years. It was at that time that the
<div n="lb"/>Emperor of the asuras (demons), Mahābali, son of
<div n="lb"/>Virocana, was ruling the world conquering even the
<div n="lb"/>devas. After having conquered all the three worlds
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali decided to conduct a yāga. A deputation
<div n="lb"/>of the Devas headed by Agni then waited upon Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu and Agni said: “O Lord, Mahābali has com-
<div n="lb"/>menced a yāga and before it is finished you should go
<div n="lb"/>to him and do something for the benefit of the
<div n="lb"/>devas”. It was at this request of Agni that Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>took the form of Vāmana and sent Mahābali to the

<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).

<div n="NI"/>18) {%Agni and Nahuṣa.%} Repenting for his act of killing
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra Indra unknown to anybody went and hid in a
<div n="lb"/>lotus in the Mānasa Saras (Lake Mānasa). Perplexed
<div n="lb"/>by the disappearance of their leader the devas brought
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa from the Earth and made him their leader.
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa became very proud and arrogant of his new
<div n="lb"/>position and tried to make Indrāṇī his wife. Indrāṇī
<div n="lb"/>went to Bṛhaspatī for help. Bṛhaspati commanded
<div n="lb"/>Agni to go and find out Indra. Agni searched for him
<div n="lb"/>in forests, rivers and oceans. At last he went to
<div n="lb"/>Mānasa Saras and searched among the lotuses. There
<div n="lb"/>he found Indra hiding in a lotus and Bṛhaspati was
<div n="lb"/>duly informed. Then Bṛhaspati gave Indrāṇī some
<div n="lb"/>clever directions to kill Nahuṣa and Nahuṣa was
<div n="lb"/>killed. (See Agastya). There is a story in Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 28, of how Agni took for himself a quarter of
<div n="lb"/>the sin which Indra acquired because of his killing
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra, a brahmin by birth. (Chapter 14, Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Agni Deva and Kārttavīryārjuna.%} After the great
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra battle the Pāṇḍavas went again to Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra along with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. On their way Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>showed them the Paraśurāmahradas and narrated to
<div n="lb"/>them several stories of Rāma. Reference to Agni
<div n="lb"/>comes when Kṛṣṇa explains the reason why Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>cut off the thousand hands of Kārttavīryārjuna. It was
<div n="lb"/>at the time when Kārttavīryārjuna was ruling the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds by his might that Agni went and asked for
<div n="lb"/>alms from him. Kārttavīrya gave Agni mountains and
<div n="lb"/>forests for his food which Agni burnt and ate. In one
<div n="lb"/>of the forests was the āśrama of sage Āpava and that
<div n="lb"/>also was burnt. Enraged at this the sage cursed Kārtta-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya saying that his thousand hands would be cut off
<div n="lb"/>by Paraśurāma. Though the curse was not seriously
<div n="lb"/>minded by the King then, it so happened that before
<div n="lb"/>long Kārttavīrya had to encounter Paraśurāma in a
<div n="lb"/>battle when the children of the King stole a sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>cow belonging to Jamadagni, father of Paraśurāma.
<div n="lb"/>In the battle all the thousand hands of Kārtta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna were cut off by Paraśurāma. (Chapter 43,
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%How Agni was duped.%} Once the wives of the Sapta-
<div n="lb"/>ṛṣis (seven Saints) attended a yāga where Agni was
<div n="lb"/>also present. Agni fell in love with them but knowing
<div n="lb"/>it to be futile to make any attempt to fulfil his desire
<div n="lb"/>he went to the forests dejected. Svāhādevī, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa was for a long time craving to marry Agni and
<div n="lb"/>she decided to take advantage of the opportunity thus
<div n="lb"/>offered. Disguising herself as the wife of Aṅgiras, one
<div n="lb"/>of the seven saints, she approached Agni and said: “O
<div n="lb"/>Lord, I am Śivā, wife of Aṅgiras. We were all excited
<div n="lb"/>when you darted cupids' arrows against us and they
<div n="lb"/>have now selected me to come to you for fulfilling your
<div n="lb"/>desire”. Agni believed her and took her as his consort.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 223 to 227 of Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%How Agni became a doctor.%} There was once a sage
<div n="lb"/>called Dattātreya who had a son called Nimi. Nimi
<div n="lb"/>had a son and he died after thousand years. The
<div n="lb"/>bereaved sage performed a Śrāddha which was attend-
<div n="lb"/>ed by all devas. The feast was so sumptuous that the
<div n="lb"/>devas got indigestion after that. Consulting Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>Agni prescribed a remedy for their indigestion. He said:
<div n="lb"/>“whenever you take any food make me also a partici-
<div n="lb"/>pant in that. If you do so you will never get indiges-
<div n="lb"/>tion”. That is why a very small portion of any cooked
[Page014-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>food is first thrown into the fire before given for eat-
<div n="lb"/>ing. This story is part of Bhīṣma's oration to Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra on the origin of Śrāddha (The ceremony con-
<div n="lb"/>ducted on the anniversary of the death of a person by
<div n="lb"/>his son). (Chapter 92, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%How Agni became a horse.%} There was once a precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor named Āveda. He got a disciple named Uttaṅga.
<div n="lb"/>One day Āveda left his āśrama for a distant place
<div n="lb"/>leaving his disciple in charge of the management of the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. The preceptor was absent for a long time and
<div n="lb"/>his wife started making love to Uttaṅga. The dutiful
<div n="lb"/>disciple strongly objected to this. When Uttaṅga com-
<div n="lb"/>pleted his course of study under Āveda he enquired
<div n="lb"/>what he should give to his preceptor. The preceptor
<div n="lb"/>directed him to his wife. The wife who bore a grudge
<div n="lb"/>against Uttaṅga resolved to tease him and said that
<div n="lb"/>he should go to King Pauṣya and beg of him the
<div n="lb"/>earrings worn by his wife. Uttaṅga started immediately
<div n="lb"/>and getting the earrings was coming back when on
<div n="lb"/>the way Takṣaka wrested the ornament from him and
<div n="lb"/>went and hid in the nether-world. Uttaṅga followed
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka and there Agni in the form of a horse appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed before him and asked Uttaṅga what he wanted.
<div n="lb"/>He replied that he wanted to subdue all the serpents in
<div n="lb"/>the nether-world. Agni then advised him to blow thro'
<div n="lb"/>the nostrils of the horse. As he did so flames burst forth
<div n="lb"/>from all the openings of the horse making the nether-
<div n="lb"/>world hot and smoky. Takṣaka was frightened and he
<div n="lb"/>at once gave back the earrings to Uttaṅga. Uttaṅga
<div n="lb"/>was again worried for he had very little time to carry the
<div n="lb"/>earrings to the preceptor in time. Here again Agni helped
<div n="lb"/>him by carrying him swiftly on his back to the āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>When the preceptor and his wife found that Uttaṅga
<div n="lb"/>had carried out their wish they blessed him. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>3, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Agni becomes a messenger.%} Once there arose a mis-
<div n="lb"/>understanding between Bṛhaspati and Saṃvarttaka,
<div n="lb"/>sons of Aṅgiras. Bṛhaspati went to devaloka as priest
<div n="lb"/>while the other remained in the world as a mad saint.
<div n="lb"/>At that time a King called Marutta invited Bṛhaspati to
<div n="lb"/>officiate as priest for a yajña of his. But Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb"/>refused to accept it. Nārada saw Marutta in despair
<div n="lb"/>and told him thus: “You go to Kāśī (Benares) and
<div n="lb"/>there at Puradvāra place a dead body and wait there.
<div n="lb"/>Saṃvarttaka, Bṛhaspati's brother will come and repri-
<div n="lb"/>mand you. Without minding his scoldings follow him
<div n="lb"/>and request him to become the chief priest for your
<div n="lb"/>yāga. He will then ask you who advised you to do
<div n="lb"/>like this. Tell him that Nārada did so and if he asks
<div n="lb"/>where he could find Nārada do tell him that Nārada
<div n="lb"/>is hiding inside Agni”. Hearing this Marutta went to
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī and did all as directed. Saṃvartta agreed to be-
<div n="lb"/>come the priest but wanted Marutta to bring some gold
<div n="lb"/>from Kailāsa before that. Marutta brought that also
<div n="lb"/>and the yajña started. Bṛhaspati when he came to know
<div n="lb"/>of all these developments became sorry for his refusal
<div n="lb"/>first and decided to become the priest of Marutta for his
<div n="lb"/>yāga. It was Agni who carried this message of consent
<div n="lb"/>to King Marutta. Thus Marutta's yajña was performed
<div n="lb"/>in a grand way. (Chapter 9, Aśvamedha Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Agni takes back the Gāṇḍīva.%} At the time of
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍava dahana (burning of Khāṇḍava forest) Agni
<div n="lb"/>gave Arjuna the famous Gāṇḍīva bow which Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>had given him. After the great Mahābhārata battle
<div n="lb"/>Agni took back this bow from Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas
[Page014-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>at the fag end of their life started on a pilgrimage to
<div n="lb"/>the south with their consort Pāñcālī. Marching along
<div n="lb"/>slowly they reached the shores of Aruṇa Samudra
<div n="lb"/>(Aruṇa Ocean). Arjuna had with him then the Gāṇḍīva
<div n="lb"/>and also the arrow-case which never becomes empty.
<div n="lb"/>When they reached the shores of the ocean Agni blocked
<div n="lb"/>their way standing before them in the form of a huge
<div n="lb"/>mountain and said, “O Arjuna I am god Agni. It was I
<div n="lb"/>who gave this famous Gāṇḍīva bow to you. The bow
<div n="lb"/>belongs to Varuṇa. So please throw it into the ocean
<div n="lb"/>and proceed on your way”. On hearing this Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>threw both the bow and the arrow-case into the ocean
<div n="lb"/>and continued the march. (Ślokas 33 to 43, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>1, Mahāprasthānika Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Additional information about Agni, the God of fire.%}
<div n="NI"/>1) Svāhādevī, wife of Agni, gave birth to three sons,
<div n="lb"/>named Dākṣiṇam, Gārhapatyam and Āhavanīyam.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 9, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) Agni, the God of fire, got three sons by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Svāhādevī named Pāvaka, Pavamāna and Śuci. These
<div n="lb"/>three sons had all together fortyfive sons. These forty-
<div n="lb"/>five grandsons, three sons and Agni himself constitute
<div n="lb"/>the fortynine Fires mentioned in the purāṇas (Aṅgira-
<div n="lb"/>saṃ).
<div n="NI"/>3) Nīla, the monkey, is born of Agni. (Sarga 41,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter Kiṣkindhā, Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the great archer, was born of Agni.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 126, Chapter 67, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) Subrahmaṇya was born as the son of Agni. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>225, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) Agni, the God of fire, loved all prajāpatis like his
<div n="lb"/>sons. (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>7) The sage, Bhṛgu, was born from Agni. (Śloka 8,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>8) All Devatās are Agni himself. (Śloka 109, Chapter 85,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>9) God Agni loved God Skanda more than anybody
<div n="lb"/>else. (Chapter 226, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>10) At the time when Śrī Rāma after killing Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was putting Sītā to a purity test by throwing her into the
<div n="lb"/>fire, Agni witnessed that Sītā had done no wrong and
<div n="lb"/>was pure and chaste as before. (Śloka 28, Chapter 201,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>11) In the beginning Brahmā created the universe.
<div n="lb"/>There was no death then and the Earth became over-
<div n="lb"/>crowded. Brahmā got worried and he sent fire from his
<div n="lb"/>body to burn all beings. The world was on the verge
<div n="lb"/>of extinction when Lord Śiva intervened and requested
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā to withdraw Agni and create the god of Death.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 52, Droṇa Parva. M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>12) Agni is one of the Aṣṭa Vasūs which are eight in
<div n="lb"/>number. The others are: Āpa, Dhruva, Soma, Dharma,
<div n="lb"/>Anila, Pratyuṣa and Prabhāsa. (Chapter 15, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>13) Śuci, son of Agni, born of Svāhādevī is Baḍavāgni
<div n="lb"/>himself. (Chapter 20, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>14) The God, Agni, uses a spear as his weapon and
<div n="lb"/>the vehicle he uses is a goat. (Chapter 51, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>15) The sage, Agastya, converted the Viṣṇu idol at the
<div n="lb"/>Kuttālam temple into one of Śiva and when people
<div n="lb"/>around started an agitation Agastya sent forth flames
<div n="lb"/>of fire through his eyes. (Asura Kāṇḍa of Skānda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>16) Agni was born to Pururavas as a son named Jāta-
<div n="lb"/>vedas. (Chapter 14, Navama Skandha of Bhāgavata).
[Page015-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>17) The Devas wanted help to clean their hands when
<div n="lb"/>oblated materials stuck to their hands and Agni creat-
<div n="lb"/>ed from water three sons named Ekata, Dvita and
<div n="lb"/>Trita for this purpose. Of these Trita fell into a well
<div n="lb"/>while drawing water. Seeing him fall the demons
<div n="lb"/>closed the well but Trita broke the top and came out.
<div n="lb"/>(Sūkta 52, Anuvāka 10, Maṇḍala 1 of Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>18) Once the earth looked like heaven because of the
<div n="lb"/>innumerable celestial beings who came to earth in search
<div n="lb"/>of Agni. (Sūkta 65, Anuvāka 12, Maṇḍala 1 of Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda).
<div n="NI"/>19) The Sun hands over his effulgence to Agni in the
<div n="lb"/>evening and takes it back from him in the morning. (A
<div n="lb"/>fact from Śruti—Sūkta 71, Anuvāka 12, Maṇḍala 1 of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>20) For making fire for the sacrificial ceremony the
<div n="lb"/>sages use two Araṇi sticks (These are two pieces of wood,
<div n="lb"/>one upper and another lower, and fire is produced by
<div n="lb"/>attrition). It is believed that the sages get the strength
<div n="lb"/>to produce fire from it through Vyāna, one of the forms
<div n="lb"/>of Vāyu (air). So Ṛgveda describes Agni as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu. (Sūkta 112, Anuvāka 16, Maṇḍala 1).
<div n="NI"/>21) In the times of the Ṛgveda Agni was worshipped
<div n="lb"/>as a God. (Sūkta 1, Anuvāka 1, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>22) Lord Śiva entered into an elaborate and long
<div n="lb"/>conjugal play for creating Subrahmaṇya. Hundred
<div n="lb"/>years went by and still the preliminaries never ended.
<div n="lb"/>The universe was on the verge of a collapse and so
<div n="lb"/>the devas decided to send Agni to put a stop to this
<div n="lb"/>libidinal play of Śiva. But Agni was afraid of Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>therefore absconded and hid himself in the ocean. The
<div n="lb"/>ocean became hot and the water-animals unable to
<div n="lb"/>bear the increasing heat went and informed the devas of
<div n="lb"/>Agni's hiding place. Agni cursed them all saying that all
<div n="lb"/>of them would go dumb. He then went to the Mandara
<div n="lb"/>mountain in the shape of an owl and hid there. But the
<div n="lb"/>devas went there also and picked him up. Agni then by
<div n="lb"/>his terrible heat stimulated Śiva into action. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>threw his semen into Agni and Agni poured it into
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Gaṅgā delivered a child which later on be-
<div n="lb"/>came Subrahmaṇya. (Taraṅga 6, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka
<div n="lb"/>of Kathāsaritsāgara).
<div n="NI"/>26) {%Conclusion.%} Agni stands next to Indra in impor-
<div n="lb"/>tance in the Vedas. Because Agnī was indispensable for
<div n="lb"/>yāgas the care of Agni became very important. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the Ṛgveda the birth of Agni is different. Born
<div n="lb"/>of the clouds Agni reaches the earth as lightning. Then
<div n="lb"/>Agni forsakes its form and becomes invisible. It was
<div n="lb"/>Mātariśvā who gave form to Agni and gave him to the
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu family. From that day onwards it became
<div n="lb"/>possible to produce fire and the Ṛgveda describes how
<div n="lb"/>Agni is produced by sages by the use of Araṇi sticks.
<div n="lb"/>The main job of Agni is to receive the oblations from
<div n="lb"/>devas when they conduct yāgas.
