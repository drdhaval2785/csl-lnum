VṚṢA IV¦. An incarnation of Śiva in the form of an ox.
<div n="lb"/>The following is a story that occurs in Śiva Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Śatarudasaṃhitā, about this incarnation.
<div n="NI"/>When the Devas and the Asuras united together
<div n="lb"/>and churned the sea of milk, ever so many noble objects
<div n="lb"/>rose up to the surface of the sea. Several beautiful
<div n="lb"/>damsels also came up. Viṣṇu grew amorous of them
<div n="lb"/>and thus thousands of sons were born by them. These sons
<div n="lb"/>who were born in the Pātāla (Nether world), by and by,
<div n="lb"/>came up and began to do harm to the dwellers of the
<div n="lb"/>earth. At this time Śiva took the incarnation in the
<div n="lb"/>form of an ox to study the situation properly. In this
<div n="lb"/>disguise Śiva entered Pātāla and took by stealth the
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana (the weapon of Viṣṇu) and drove him to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. When Viṣṇu had gone from Pātāla, he had
<div n="lb"/>advised his sons to stay in Pātāla. Vṛṣa who came to
<div n="lb"/>know of this, cursed them:—“Any man, other than the
<div n="lb"/>peaceful hermits and Dānavas (asuras) who are born
<div n="lb"/>from my portion, who enters Pātāla shall die.” From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards, the world of Pātāla became a for-
<div n="lb"/>bidden place for men.
