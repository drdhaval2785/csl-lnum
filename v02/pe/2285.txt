EKAVĪRA¦
<F>1. The genealogy of Ekavīra is stated differently in different Purāṇas. Devī Bhāgavata states that Ekavīra is the son of Turvasu,
<div n="lb"/>son of Yayāti and that he is the father of Kārtavīryārjuna. It is not correct. The genealogy chronicled here is based on Agni and Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. According to that Yadu, son of Yayāti is the father of the grandfather of Ekavīra: Yadu—Sahasrajit—Satajit—Hehaya (Ekavīra).
<div n="lb"/>Descending from Ekavīra—Dharma—Kuṇi—Bhadrasena—Dhanaka—Krtavīra—Kārtavīrvārjuna. From the grandson of Kārtavīryārjuna,
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣṇi, starts the Vṛṣṇi dynasty.</F> (HEHAYA). A founder of the Hehaya
<div n="lb"/>line of kings.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu: Atri—
<div n="lb"/>Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Yayāti—Yadu—
<div n="lb"/>Sahasrajit—Śatajit—Ekavīra (Hehaya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Ekavīra.%} Once there was a King called
<div n="lb"/>Revanta who was an intimate friend of Indra. One day
<div n="lb"/>riding on Uccaiḥśravas, Indra's horse, he went to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. Fascinated by the arresting beauty of
<div n="lb"/>Revanta, Mahālakṣmī sat gaping for a while and did
<div n="lb"/>not hear what Viṣṇu talked to her. Viṣṇu was offended
<div n="lb"/>and lost his temper. Lakṣmī was looking with interest
<div n="lb"/>alternatively at Revanta and the horse when Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>cursed her to be born as a mare on earth. Horrified,
<div n="lb"/>shedding tears, Lakṣmī begged for relief. Viṣṇu decreed
<div n="lb"/>that she would return to Vaikuṇṭha after giving birth
<div n="lb"/>to a son who would be equal in glory to Viṣṇu himself.
<div n="lb"/>Mahālakṣmī came to Earth taking the shape of a mare
<div n="lb"/>and lived in a forest situated at a point where the rivers
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī and Tamasā meet and where once Sūryapatnī
<div n="lb"/>stayed and did penance. Meditating on Śiva she lived
<div n="lb"/>there for a thousand divine years and then one day
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Pārvatī appeared before her and asked her
<div n="lb"/>what she wanted. She then said “Oh, Bhagavan, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu cursed me and made me into a mare. He has
<div n="lb"/>decreed that I would go back after bringing forth a son
<div n="lb"/>as glorious as Viṣṇu. From whom am I to bear a son
<div n="lb"/>like this?” Śiva promised to find a solution and going to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha sent Viṣṇu to earth in the form of a horse.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu came to Lakṣmī and they lived together for some
<div n="lb"/>time and soon a son was born to Lakṣmī. Leaving the
<div n="lb"/>child in the forest both of them went back to Vai-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇṭha. It is this child who later on became the famous
<div n="lb"/>King, Ekavīra. It was because he was born of a horse
<div n="lb"/>that he got the names, Hehaya and Haihaya. (Skandha
<div n="lb"/>6, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Ekavīra came to the palace.%} It was at this time that
<div n="lb"/>Śatajit, son of the grandson of Yayāti was doing
<div n="lb"/>penance to obtain a son. He was also doing penance
<div n="lb"/>in the forest situated at a point where the rivers Kālindī
<div n="lb"/>and Tamasā meet. One night a Vidyādhara named
<div n="lb"/>Campaka came with a Vidyādharī named Madālasā
<div n="lb"/>and seeing the infant lying helpless in the forest took
<div n="lb"/>it to Devaloka. Indra recognised it as the child born to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī on earth while they were living as
<div n="lb"/>horse and mare and so the Vidyādhara put it back on
<div n="lb"/>earth in the same place as before. Immediately Lakṣmī-
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇas appeared before Śatajit doing penance there
<div n="lb"/>and asking him to take care of a child lying helpless in
<div n="lb"/>another side of the forest disappeared. Immensely
<div n="lb"/>pleased at this Śatajit took the child to his palace and
<div n="lb"/>brought him forth as his own son giving the child the
<div n="lb"/>name Ekavīra. When the boy became a prince, Śatajit
<div n="lb"/>crowned Ekavīra King and went to the forest with his
<div n="lb"/>queen and after doing penance there for sometime
<div n="lb"/>attained Viṣṇuloka. (Skandha 6, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ekavīra marries Ekāvalī.%} Once Prince Ekavīra
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by the son of the minister went for a plea-
<div n="lb"/>sure trip to the banks of the river Gaṅgā. It was spring
<div n="lb"/>and the prince wandering about enjoying the sight of a
[Page269-b+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>flowery forest was soon arrested by the sight of a
<div n="lb"/>sweet smelling lotus with a hundred petals blooming in
<div n="lb"/>the river. By the side of the lotus was standing a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful damsel weeping. The prince went to her and
<div n="lb"/>asked her the reason for her weeping. After great per-
<div n="lb"/>suasion she replied thus: “Oh, Prince, there is a country
<div n="lb"/>not far from yours which is now being ruled over by a
<div n="lb"/>very righteous King called Raibhya. His queen is called
<div n="lb"/>Rukmarekhā. They had no children for a very long
<div n="lb"/>time and so Raibhya conducted a Putrakāmeṣṭi yāga.
<div n="lb"/>When ghee was poured profusely into the sacrificial fire
<div n="lb"/>the flames rose up to great heights and from inside the
<div n="lb"/>flames came out a lovely maiden. The King named her
<div n="lb"/>Ekāvalī and bought her forth as his daughter. I am
<div n="lb"/>Yaśovatī the daughter of the minister there. We were
<div n="lb"/>of the same age and so I was asked to live with her as
<div n="lb"/>her companion. She was very fond of lotuses and the
<div n="lb"/>King constructed big ponds with lotuses in them for
<div n="lb"/>her recreation. Yet she used to go to other ponds also
<div n="lb"/>in search of lotuses.
<div n="NI"/>One day we came to this side of the river Gaṅgā to
<div n="lb"/>play. Then a demon of name Kālaketu came and kidnapp-
<div n="lb"/>ed her. I followed her. She never surrendered to the
<div n="lb"/>enticements and persuasions of Kālaketu. Her father
<div n="lb"/>wanted her to be married to Ekavīra, King of Hehaya.
<div n="lb"/>Kālaketu sent her to prison. Without knowing what to
<div n="lb"/>do next I am standing here weeping.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Ekavīra went to Pātāla and defeating
<div n="lb"/>Kālaketu released Ekāvalī and brought both Ekāvalī
<div n="lb"/>and Yaśovatī to the palace of Raibhya. Pleased at this
<div n="lb"/>Raibhya gave his daughter in marriage to Ekavīra.
<div n="lb"/>Kārtavīryārjuna was born in the family of Ekavīra.
<div n="lb"/>(Skandha 6, Devī Bhāgavata).
