ŚVETAKI¦. A King. He was mostly occupied in perform-
[Page781-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ing Yajñas. Mahābhārata gives the following details
<div n="lb"/>about this yajña lover:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Śvetaki performed numerous Yajñas. He was a
<div n="lb"/>King who was deeply absorbed in Yajñas. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 222).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once the Yajña he performed was so prolonged
<div n="lb"/>that the Ṛtviks were utterly tired and left the Yajña in
<div n="lb"/>the middle. After that the King had to bring in other
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtviks to complete it. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 225,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) He worshipped Śiva and propitiated him to get a
<div n="lb"/>blessing to enable him to perform many Yajñas. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>advised him that he should do “āhuti” (homa or sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice) in Agni continuously for twelve years. Accepting
<div n="lb"/>this advice, the king invited Durvāsas to make arrange-
<div n="lb"/>ments for the Yajña. Appointing Durvāsas as Ṛtvik,
<div n="lb"/>Śvetaki continued the Yajña for a hundred years. (For
<div n="lb"/>more information see under Khāṇḍavadāha).
