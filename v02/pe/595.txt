ATALA¦. This is one of the seven sections of Pātāla. The
<div n="lb"/>seven sections are: Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talātala,
<div n="lb"/>Mahātala, Rasātala, Pātāla. Of them Atala has been
<div n="lb"/>described as follows: Atala is the first world of Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>There reigns Bala, the son of Maya who is the famous
<div n="lb"/>but haughty magician. He has created 96 Mayas who
<div n="lb"/>are capable of granting all kinds of desires. Even now
<div n="lb"/>certain persons who are interested in the practice of
<div n="lb"/>Black magic, learn some of these 96 arts and practise
<div n="lb"/>them. When this mighty fellow opens his mouth for
<div n="lb"/>yawning, three groups of women known as Puṃścalīs,
<div n="lb"/>Svairiṇīs and Kāminīs emerge from his mouth. He has
<div n="lb"/>with him a rasāyana called hāṭaka with which he can
<div n="lb"/>easily entice and seduce all who enter Atala and to
<div n="lb"/>strengthen them for satisfying his lust. After enticing
<div n="lb"/>them with it, he enjoys uncontrolled pleasure with
<div n="lb"/>them, showering on them his amorous glances, bewitch-
[Page072-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>ing smiles and embraces. (Devī Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
