DURVĀRAṆA II¦. A messenger of the very powerful
<div n="lb"/>Jalandhara. When the Devas and the Asuras churned
<div n="lb"/>Kṣīrābdhi (ocean of milk), many excellent things emer-
<div n="lb"/>ged out of it. When those things were divided among
<div n="lb"/>them all, Devendra took possession of 14 gems in an
<div n="lb"/>unauthorised manner. When Jalandhara, through his
<div n="lb"/>messenger Durvāraṇa, demanded Devendra to return
<div n="lb"/>the gems, not only did he not return them but he also
<div n="lb"/>declared war against Jalandhara. When war broke out
<div n="lb"/>Jalandhara hesitated as to whether he should fight
<div n="lb"/>with Viṣṇu or with Śiva. Durvāraṇa advised him first
<div n="lb"/>to fight with Śiva. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 16).
