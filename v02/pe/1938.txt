DHARMADATTA II¦. A Brahmin who lived in the city
<div n="lb"/>of Karavīra. One day while Dharmadatta was going to
<div n="lb"/>the temple with material for pūjā he came across a
<div n="lb"/>demoness named Kalahā on the way. The brahmin
<div n="lb"/>threw the pūjā materials in his hand on to the face of
<div n="lb"/>the demoness. When a tulasī leaf touched the demoness
<div n="lb"/>she got back the memory of her previous birth.
<div n="NI"/>Kalahā then abandoned her cruel nature and begged
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadatta to advise her as to how she should get a
<div n="lb"/>release from her demonaic life. Taking pity on her
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadatta gave her all the ‘puṇya’ he had obtained
<div n="lb"/>by observing Kārttikavrata. (Chapters 106, 107, Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa and Chapters 2, 4, 24, 25
<div n="lb"/>Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Dharmadatta and Kalahā were born as Daśaratha and
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī in their next births as a result of the accumulat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Puṇya obtained by observing Kārttikavrata. (Sāra
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa, Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa).
