<div n="NI"/>1). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti—Puru—Janamejaya—Prācinvān—Pravīra—
<div n="lb"/>Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvidha—Saṃyāti—
<div n="lb"/>Rahovādī—Raudrāśva—Matināra—Santurodha—
<div n="lb"/>Duṣyanta—Bharata—Suhotā—Gala—Garda—Suketu—

<div n="lb"/>Puruja—Arka—Bhavyāśva—Pāñcāla—Mudgala. A dau-
<div n="lb"/>ghter called Ahalyā was born to Mudgala. Maharṣi Gau-
<div n="lb"/>tama married her. To Gautama was born Śatānanda, to
<div n="lb"/>him Satyadhṛti, to him Śaradvān and to Śaradvān was
<div n="lb"/>born Kṛpācārya. The Purāṇas refer to the generation
<div n="lb"/>preceding Gautama only in the maternal line. It is said
<div n="lb"/>in verse 2, Chapter 130 of the Ādi Parva, that Śaradvān
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Gautama. According to Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata etc. Śaradvān, father of Kṛpa was the son
<div n="lb"/>of the great-grand son of Gautama and grandson of
<div n="lb"/>Śatānanda. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 278).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Kṛpa.%} Though born in a family of Sages
<div n="lb"/>Śaradvān evinced more interest in Dhanurveda. He
<div n="lb"/>performed penance in the forest, with bow and arrows
<div n="lb"/>deposited by his side. As his penance gathered intensity
<div n="lb"/>the Devas got alarmed. To break his penance Indra
<div n="lb"/>deputed the Devatā called Jānapadī to the earth and
<div n="lb"/>she appeared before Śaradvān and danced, dressed only
<div n="lb"/>in one piece of cloth. Emission occurred to him. But,
<div n="lb"/>wisdom dawned on him immediately and leaving behind
<div n="lb"/>him the bow, arrows and deer skin he quitted the
<div n="lb"/>place.
<div n="NI"/>The semen discharged by him fell on the arrow which
<div n="lb"/>broke into two giving birth to a male child and a
<div n="lb"/>female one.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kṛpa in the Palace.%} One of the attendants of King
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu, who had come to the forest to hunt, saw the
<div n="lb"/>children and took them to the King. The King felt Kṛpā
<div n="lb"/>(pity) for them and brought them up in the palace
<div n="lb"/>and as they were thus brought up due to his Kṛpā they
<div n="lb"/>came to be called Kṛpa and Kṛpī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>130).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kṛpa's mastery of Dhanurveda.%} While living in the
<div n="lb"/>forest engaged in penance Śaradvān, with his divine
<div n="lb"/>power understood that the two children forsaken by
<div n="lb"/>him were growing up in the palace. He went to the
<div n="lb"/>palace and told the king details about the children. He
<div n="lb"/>also lived there in secret and taught Kṛpa everything
<div n="lb"/>contained in the four branches of Dhanurveda and the
<div n="lb"/>various usages in archery. Gradually Kṛpa became an
<div n="lb"/>ācārya (master) in Dhanurveda. Not only the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas, the Yādavas and the Vṛṣṇis but also
<div n="lb"/>kings, who came from various regions of the country
<div n="lb"/>learned archery at the feet of Kṛpa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>130, Verse 23).

<div n="lb"/>{%the Pāṇḍavas.%} When the training of the Kauravas and
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas in archery was over a test was arranged
<div n="lb"/>for them. Spectators crowded to see it. Droṇa, Kṛpa,
<div n="lb"/>Somadatta, Bālhīka, Bhīṣma and Vidura and other
<div n="lb"/>great ones took their seats in the stadium. Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa entered the arena for contest when Kṛpa inter-
<div n="lb"/>vened and said that Arjuna was the youngest son of
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī but Karṇa should specify his parentage. At this
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa stood stunned, and it was then that Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>declared Karṇa to be the King of Aṅga. (Ādi Parva,
