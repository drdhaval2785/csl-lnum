DURJAYA I¦. An absolutely cruel King. Owing to the
<div n="lb"/>number of adharmas (evil actions he had committed)
<div n="lb"/>Kāla ordained him to be born and reborn twentyone
<div n="lb"/>times as various animals and as a Brahmarākṣasa he
<div n="lb"/>roamed about forests. One of those days he caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of a Śīvayogī called Mahādeva whose body was
<div n="lb"/>smeared with Vibhūti (the sacred ash), but as soon as
<div n="lb"/>the Vibhūti from the body of the Śivayogī got smeared
<div n="lb"/>on his body also, Durjaya got back his former form
<div n="lb"/>and he was lifted upto Svarga. (Śiva Purāṇa, Bhasma
<div n="lb"/>Māhātmya).
