JANAMEJAYA V¦. Another King born in the dynasty
<div n="lb"/>of Parīkṣit. He had a son called Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 3). He once committed
<div n="lb"/>brahmahatyā (sin of killing a brahmin) and so had
<div n="lb"/>been forsaken by his subjects. So he had to take to
<div n="lb"/>the forest. His search for means to get rid of the sin
<div n="lb"/>took him at last to sage Indrota, who made him per-
<div n="lb"/>form Aśvamedha yajña. Thus, he got redemption from
<div n="lb"/>the sin and he became Indrota's disciple also. (Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 150-153).
