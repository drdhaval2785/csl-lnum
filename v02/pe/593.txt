AŚVINĪSUTA¦. A son born to Sūrya of the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Sutapas. There is this story about it in Brahmavai-
<div n="lb"/>varta Purāṇa. Once when the wife of Sutapas was on
<div n="lb"/>a pilgrimage Sūrya happened to see her. The beautiful
<div n="lb"/>and venerable lady refused to accede to the desire of
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya and so the latter used force and took her. They
<div n="lb"/>had a son who was named Aśvinīsuta. On her return
<div n="lb"/>after the pilgrimage with her son she explained all that
<div n="lb"/>happened and the sage sent both of them out. Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>taught his son Aśvinīsuta astrology and made him a
<div n="lb"/>master in that science. Knowing that, Sutapas cursed
<div n="lb"/>him and said he would turn to be one very diseased.
<div n="lb"/>Later the sage amended his curse and added that he
<div n="lb"/>would be free from disease if he worshipped the sun.
