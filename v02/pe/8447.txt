VIROCANA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} An asura. He was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda and the father of Mahābali. Three sons Viro-
<div n="lb"/>cana, Kumbha and Nikumbha were born to Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Dhṛti. Virocana, though an asura, perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed rites and rituals carefully. He was kind towards
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins. His son Bali became famous and got the
<div n="lb"/>name Mahābali. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>19).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once there was a controversy between Virocana
<div n="lb"/>and Sudhanvā. (See under Sudhanvā II).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the time of emperor Pṛthu, when the
[Page862-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>asuras milked the earth Virocana stood as the calf.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69, Stanza 20).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Virocana is included among the ancient Kings of
<div n="lb"/>prominence. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 227, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>50).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) There is a story about the quest for knowledge
<div n="lb"/>about universal and individual souls, by Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Virocana, in Chāndogyopaniṣad, as given below.
<div n="NI"/>Once the Devas and the asuras approached Prajāpati
<div n="lb"/>to learn about Brahman, the impersonal God. Prajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati told them: “Ātman (soul) is the first tattva
<div n="lb"/>(Essential being) which is sinless, eternal, desireless
<div n="lb"/>and unimaginable in the earth.” Having heard this
<div n="lb"/>philosophy about the soul, the Devas selected Indra,
<div n="lb"/>and the asuras selected Virocana and to know the
<div n="lb"/>details, they sent them to Prajāpati as his disciples.
<div n="NI"/>Indra and Virocana stayed with Prajāpati for several
<div n="lb"/>years to know more about Ātman. But Prajāpati did
<div n="lb"/>not reveal to them the secret about Brahman. At last to
<div n="lb"/>test them Prajāpati said “Your reflection that you see in
<div n="lb"/>water or mirror is the Ātman (soul).”
<div n="NI"/>Virocana, who mistook what the Prajāpati said as truth
<div n="lb"/>immediately took his bath, put on costly dress and orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments and stood near water and saw his reflection in water.
<div n="lb"/>After that, taking the reflection for soul, he spread this
<div n="lb"/>doctrine among his people. With this the asuras accept-
<div n="lb"/>ed body as soul. But the Devas did not recognize this
<div n="lb"/>philosophy. They accepted the doctrine that Ātman is
<div n="lb"/>that essence of Nature which is alien to body and mind
<div n="lb"/>and which is pure.
<div n="NI"/>(v) There are two different statements about the death
<div n="lb"/>of Virocana in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) In the battle with Tārakāsura, Virocana was killed
<div n="lb"/>by Devendra. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 99.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāṇḍa 1. 20. 35; Matsya: 10: 11; Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa 16).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The Sun God was pleased with Virocana and had
<div n="lb"/>given him a crown. The sun told him that death would
<div n="lb"/>come only if that crown was removed from the head by
<div n="lb"/>some body. Because of this boon Virocana became
<div n="lb"/>arrogant. So Mahāviṣṇu took the form of a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>woman and enticed Virocana towards him and taking
<div n="lb"/>away the crown killed him. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa 2, 29).
<div n="NI"/>According to Nārada Purāṇa, Mahāviṣṇu took the form
<div n="lb"/>of a Brahmin and reached the palace of Virocana. There
<div n="lb"/>changing the righteous wife of Virocana into a mad
<div n="lb"/>woman he killed Virocana.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Virocana had two wives called Viśālākṣī and Devī.
<div n="lb"/>Two children, Bala and Ya odharā were born by them.
<div n="lb"/>The wife of the famous Tvaṣṭā was this Yaśodharā.
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmāṇḍa. 3: 1: 86; Nārada Purāṇa 2: 32: Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 9).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Virocana had five brothers named Kumbha, Nikum-
<div n="lb"/>bha, Āyuṣmān, Śibi and Bāṣkali and a sister named
<div n="lb"/>Virocanā. (Vāyu Purāṇa. 84, 19).
