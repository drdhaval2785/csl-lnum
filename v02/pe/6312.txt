ŚARĪRA¦. (BODY). Body is constituted of the five
<div n="lb"/>elements, earth, water, fire, air and sky (ether). What
<div n="lb"/>is solid or hard in the body is earth; liquid, is water;
<div n="lb"/>hot or burning, fire; what gives motion to the body is
<div n="lb"/>air and what are pores in the body is sky.
<div n="NI"/>Body is that which exists and functions with the five
<div n="lb"/>organs of knowledge eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin,
<div n="lb"/>and the five organs of action like Upastha (sex organ),
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇi (hand), Pāda (leg) and Vāṇī (speech). The body
<div n="lb"/>depends on the six tastes, sweet, sour, saltish, bitter,
<div n="lb"/>hot and astringent. (Kaṭu, amla, madhura, lavaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>tikta and kaṣāya). The body is composed of seven
<div n="lb"/>internal elements (dhātus) of seven colours, white, red,
<div n="lb"/>dark (black), black and white, yellow, brassy and
<div n="lb"/>faint-white (Pāṇḍura). Vātapittakaphas (wind, bile
<div n="lb"/>and phlegm) are intertwined in the body. Since the
<div n="lb"/>body is formed of vital fluids from the sex organs of
<div n="lb"/>the father and the mother it is dviyoni (males with male
<div n="lb"/>and females with female organs of reproduction). The
<div n="lb"/>body exists by four kinds of foods, bhojya, bhakṣya, khā-
<div n="lb"/>dya and lehya. After coitus, within one night, the male
<div n="lb"/>and female semen and blood combine into one body in
<div n="lb"/>the womb (Kalala). Within seven days it becomes foamy
<div n="lb"/>(budbuda). After a fortnight it becomes solid (piṇḍa)
<div n="lb"/>and after one month hard (kaṭhina). During the
<div n="lb"/>second month the head of the child is formed; in the
<div n="lb"/>third month its feet: in the fourth its ankles, stomach
<div n="lb"/>and waist are formed. In the fifth month is formed
<div n="lb"/>the back (Pṛṣṭha) and face, nose, eyes and ears are
<div n="lb"/>formed in the sixth month. During the seventh month
<div n="lb"/>life enters the child's body. By the eighth month all the
<div n="lb"/>signs of the human being are completed in the child.
<div n="lb"/>If the vitality and effulgence of the mother are more
<div n="lb"/>than those of the father the off-spring will be female
<div n="lb"/>and vice versa; if both are in exactly equal proportions
<div n="lb"/>the child will be a eunuch, neither male nor female. If
<div n="lb"/>the parents were sad and worried during the time of
<div n="lb"/>the mother's conception, the child born would be either
<div n="lb"/>blind, lame or a pigmy. If the semen is cleft into two
<div n="lb"/>by wind (in the womb) the mother would give birth to
<div n="lb"/>twins. In the ninth month the child will be gifted
<div n="lb"/>with knowledge and it will remember to what caste it
<div n="lb"/>belonged and what all good and evil actions it did in
<div n="lb"/>its previous life.
