MAGA¦ (S). The brahmins residing in the island of Śāka
<div n="lb"/>are generally called Magas. The Brahmaparva of Bhavi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣya Purāṇa and the Sāmba Purāṇa speak about the
<div n="lb"/>Magas thus:
<div n="NI"/>Sāmba, son of Kṛṣṇa, did severe penance to please Sūrya-
<div n="lb"/>deva and pleased with the unwavering devotion of
<div n="lb"/>Sāmba, Sūrya gave him a luminous replica of himself
<div n="lb"/>for worship. Sāmba constructed a beautiful temple by
<div n="lb"/>the side of the Candrabhāgā river and installed the idol
<div n="lb"/>there. He then brought from Śākadvīpa the brahmins
<div n="lb"/>called Magas for conducting the ceremonies of the tem-
<div n="lb"/>ple. All the eighteen families of Maga brahmins came
<div n="lb"/>and stayed near the temple at the request of Sāmba.
