BODHYA¦. A famous teacher-priest. Once there was a
<div n="lb"/>discussion between Nahuṣa and Bodhya on Philosophy.
<div n="lb"/>The summary of what Bodhya said is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Before I advise others, I do it myself first. I am the tea-
<div n="lb"/>cher of none. I take the world as my teacher. I learned
<div n="lb"/>the lessons of harmlessness from snakes, disappointment
<div n="lb"/>from Piṅgala the harlot, self-sacrifice from animals,
<div n="lb"/>concentration from the archer, and loneliness from a maid
<div n="lb"/>who is a spinster. (M.B., Śānti Parva, 171, 56, 61).
<div n="NI"/>This hermit came to the King Yayāti and taught him
<div n="lb"/>philosophy and ethics. The whole of the Chapter 171
<div n="lb"/>of Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, comprises the exhortations
<div n="lb"/>of this hermit, which are known by the famous name
<div n="lb"/>Bodhya-Gītā (Song of Bodhya).
