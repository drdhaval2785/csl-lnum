NIŚUMBHA I¦. An asura. Two of the sons of Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati by his wife. Diti became notorious fellows
<div n="lb"/>called Śumbha and Niśumbha. They were born and
<div n="lb"/>brought up in Pātāla. But as young men they came to
<div n="lb"/>the earth and began rigorous tapas taking neither food
<div n="lb"/>nor drink. After ten thousand years Brahmā appeared
<div n="lb"/>and asked them to choose their boons. They requested
<div n="lb"/>for eternity, deathlessness. But, Brahmā refused to
<div n="lb"/>grant that boon. Then they thought of another boon,
<div n="lb"/>which would in effect be as good as the first one; they
<div n="lb"/>wanted death to come, but to come in a manner im-
<div n="lb"/>possible to happen. So, they requested Brahmā as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “We shall not meet with death at the hands
<div n="lb"/>of males among Devas, human beings as also by birds,
<div n="lb"/>animals etc. In short we should be killed only by
<div n="lb"/>women; we fear them not.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā granted them such a boon and they returned
<div n="lb"/>to Pātāla. They lost their head over the boon and
<div n="lb"/>appointed Śukra as their preceptor. Śukra was so
<div n="lb"/>pleased at this that he made Śumbha sit on a golden
<div n="lb"/>throne and crowned him King of Daityas. Following
<div n="lb"/>this, lesser Kings began coming to salute the great
<div n="lb"/>King and pay tributes. Great daityas like the Caṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>muṇḍas, Dhūmralocana, Raktabīja etc., became attend-
<div n="lb"/>ants of Śumbha and Niśumbha.
<div n="NI"/>After having established the power of the daityas thus
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha—Niśum bhas gradually turned their atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion towards extending the boundaries of their kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>The whole earth they subjugated. Then Niśumbha
<div n="lb"/>with a large army marched to Devaloka to conquer
<div n="lb"/>Indra. A Devāsura war started. In the fight all the
<div n="lb"/>Dikpālakas were on one side and Niśumbha alone on
<div n="lb"/>the other side; the latter side was slightly defeated.
<div n="lb"/>Smitten by Indra's Vajrāyudha Niśumbha fainted; his
<div n="lb"/>army also was broken.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as news about the defeat of his brother was
<div n="lb"/>reported to him, Śumbha, with the remaining Dānavas
<div n="lb"/>hurried to Devaloka. In the battle that ensued the
<div n="lb"/>Devas were routed. Śumbha assumed Indra-hood by
<div n="lb"/>force and the standard (flag) of the daityas was hoisted
<div n="lb"/>on the flag-staff of Sudharmā, the palace of Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha captured Kāmadhenu, Airāvata, Uccaiśśravas
<div n="lb"/>etc. The Nandana garden and the shades of the
[Page542-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Kalpaka tree were turned into resting places of the
<div n="lb"/>daityas. Fragrant flowers of the Kalpa tree adorned the
<div n="lb"/>hairs of daitya women. Śumbha drove away Kubera
<div n="lb"/>and took over Alakāpurī also from him. As Yama ran
<div n="lb"/>away from the kingdom, Kālapurī also came under
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha. All the Dikpālakas took refuge in forests and
<div n="lb"/>caves. Thousand years rolled by thus. By then the
<div n="lb"/>Devas worshipped Mahādevī, who appeared before
<div n="lb"/>them. Kauśikī devī, born from the body of Mahādevī
<div n="lb"/>stood before the Devas. As Kauśikī was dark in colour
<div n="lb"/>she came to be known as Kālikā also. Mahādevī,
<div n="lb"/>along with Kālikā started for the capital of Śumbha-
<div n="lb"/>Niśumbhas. At the capital they ascended a mountain
<div n="lb"/>and sat on two rocks. Mahādevī sang such a melodious
<div n="lb"/>song that birds and animals lost themselves in its
<div n="lb"/>sweetness and stood motionless.
<div n="NI"/>The Caṇḍamuṇḍas, who were at the time passing that
<div n="lb"/>way were also attracted by the music. Having under-
<div n="lb"/>stood what it all meant they hurried upto Śumbhāsura
<div n="lb"/>and gave him a description of the supreme beauty of
<div n="lb"/>Mahādevī and Kālikā. The description kindled great
<div n="lb"/>interest in Śumbha and Niśumbha about the devīs and
<div n="lb"/>they deputed their minister Sugrīva to bring the devīs
<div n="lb"/>over to them. Having heard Sugrīva's mission Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>devī told him as follows:—“We do not have any
<div n="lb"/>objection to becoming the wives of your masters But,
<div n="lb"/>in the matter of my marriage there is a special problem.
<div n="lb"/>While playing with my friends as a child I had
<div n="lb"/>accidentally taken a vow. I was at that age a bit proud
<div n="lb"/>about my capabilities and strength, and the vow I took
<div n="lb"/>was that I would marry only someone who was stronger
<div n="lb"/>than I am. My friends called me a ‘fool’ and ridiculed
<div n="lb"/>me about the vow. That only hardened my stubborn-
<div n="lb"/>ness and I stand by my vow even now. Therefore,
<div n="lb"/>please tell Śumbha first to defeat me in fighting.”
<div n="NI"/>When Sugrīva carried this information to Śumbha, and
<div n="lb"/>Niśumbha, they felt amused that a woman challenged
<div n="lb"/>them to fight. But, they had no alternative but to
<div n="lb"/>fight. So they deputed the mighty daitya Dhūmrākṣa
<div n="lb"/>with an army to fight Devī, and there ensued a fierce
<div n="lb"/>fighting between Devī and Kālikā on one side and the
<div n="lb"/>big daitya army on the other side. The whole army and
<div n="lb"/>finally Dhūmrākṣa too was killed.
<div n="NI"/>Devī then retired from the battlefield to a place nearby
<div n="lb"/>and blew the conch. Śumbha-Niśumbhas heard the
<div n="lb"/>sound from it, and the next moment a messenger
<div n="lb"/>came and told them about the fate of the army and of
<div n="lb"/>Dhūmrākṣa. They then sent a much greater army
<div n="lb"/>under Caṇḍamuṇḍas against Devī. But Kālikā devour-
<div n="lb"/>ed them all. Raktabīja, who next encountered Devī
<div n="lb"/>with a great force, also became food for Kālikā. Then
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha-Niśumbhas entered the battlefield and they too
<div n="lb"/>were killed. Devas thus victorious regained Svarga.
