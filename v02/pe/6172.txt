ŚAṄKARĀCĀRYA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The spiritual and philosophical preceptor
<div n="lb"/>of India. Śrī Śaṅkara was born in the village of Kālaṭi
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of the holy river Periyār, also called
<div n="lb"/>Cūrṇā and Pūrṇā. According to certain scholars he was
<div n="lb"/>born in 509 B.C. while certain others contend that he
<div n="lb"/>saw the light of day in 84 A.D. Yet others place his
<div n="lb"/>date of birth in various periods between 509 B.C. and 84
<div n="lb"/>A.D. Whatever that may be, the great ācārya is be-
<div n="lb"/>lieved to have lived only for 32 years.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} The name of Śaṅkara's father was Śivaguru
<div n="lb"/>and that of his mother Āryāmbā. This nambūdiri couple
<div n="lb"/>had no issues for a long time. So they went to Tṛśśiva-
<div n="lb"/>perūr (Trichur) to worship Śiva in the famous Śiva
<div n="lb"/>temple there. The idol in that temple is known as
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣācaleśvara and Vaṭakkunnātha also. Ere long Lord
<div n="lb"/>Śiva blessed them with a son. The belief is still held
<div n="lb"/>that, pleased with the prayer of Śivaguru and Āryāmbā
<div n="lb"/>Śiva himself was born as their son. The child began
<div n="lb"/>exhibiting extraordinary intellectual powers. At the age
<div n="lb"/>of five the boy Śaṅkara was invested with the sacred
<div n="lb"/>thread. By the time he was eight years old he had
<div n="lb"/>earned deep erudition in the Vedas, Śāstras, Purāṇas,
<div n="lb"/>epics (itihāsas) etc. His father was no more by then
<div n="lb"/>and on the mother devolved the duty of bringing the
<div n="lb"/>child up.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Crocodile-attack.%} The boy showed no taste for or
<div n="lb"/>interest in childish plays, but evinced a tendency to-
<div n="lb"/>wards a life of renunciation. This attitude of the son
<div n="lb"/>pained the mother much and she wanted her son to get
<div n="lb"/>married. But, the boy did not like the idea. As fate
<div n="lb"/>would have it, an incident which proved to be a turning
<div n="lb"/>point in the boy's life occurred soon. One day the
<div n="lb"/>mother and her son were bathing in the Periyār,
<div n="lb"/>when a crocodile caught hold of the boy. He cried
<div n="lb"/>aloud, and the mother got greatly alarmed. There was a
<div n="lb"/>custom for one to take to sannyāsa, irrespective of circum-
<div n="lb"/>stances, when danger or death threatened one, and that
<div n="lb"/>is called āpatsannyāsa. Śaṅkara prayed to his mother
<div n="lb"/>for permission to take to sannyāsa at that moment when
<div n="lb"/>his end was near, and willy-nilly the mother granted per-
<div n="lb"/>mission. All at once the crocodile, which had so unex-
[Page685-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>pectedly attacked him, disappeared equally unexpectedly.
<div n="lb"/>The boy came out of the river absolutely unhurt. The
<div n="lb"/>decision to take to sannyāsa was taken once for all.
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara assured his mother, before he started on a tour
<div n="lb"/>of the country, that he would be present at her bedside
<div n="lb"/>during her last days and also that he would duly perform
<div n="lb"/>her obsequies.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%In the presence of the preceptor.%} Śaṅkara, who then
<div n="lb"/>was not even seven years old, started for the north in
<div n="lb"/>quest of a preceptor, and on the banks of the Narmadā
<div n="lb"/>he saw Govinda-bhagavatpāda, the disciple of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Gauḍapāda. The Bhagavatpāda was sitting in a cave
<div n="lb"/>surrounded by many wise people. Śaṅkara approached
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to admit him as a disciple and grant
<div n="lb"/>him sannyāsa. Śaṅkara's prayer was granted.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Controlled flood.%} A wonderful thing happened while
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara was living at the āśrama. The Narmadā was
<div n="lb"/>in spate and the huts on its banks were about to be
<div n="lb"/>submerged in water. People got alarmed. Then Śaṅkara
<div n="lb"/>put his kamaṇḍalu (vessel which sannyāsins keep with
<div n="lb"/>them for water) and chanted the Jalākarṣaṇa Mantra.
<div n="lb"/>(hymn to attract water). At once the water which had
<div n="lb"/>flooded the banks flowed back into the river. People
<div n="lb"/>and their huts were saved. Afterwards his Guru asked
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara to go to and live in Kāśī and write Bhāṣyas
<div n="lb"/>(commentaries) on the Prasthānatrayam, i.e. the Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>sūtras, the Upaniṣads and the Gītā.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Padmapāda.%} Accordingly Śaṅkara went to Kāśī. It
<div n="lb"/>was there that he took as his first disciple Viṣṇuśarman,
<div n="lb"/>a young man from the Cola region of the country.
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara called him Sanandana. Afterwards other disci-
<div n="lb"/>ples also came in. But, gradually jealousies cropped
<div n="lb"/>up in the ranks of the disciples. The other disciples of
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara thought that the latter was partial towards
<div n="lb"/>Sanandana and showed special affection and regards
<div n="lb"/>to him. Śaṅkara then decided to prove to the others
<div n="lb"/>that Sanandana was a disciple of exceptional talents and
<div n="lb"/>merits. One day Śaṅkara was bathing with his other
<div n="lb"/>disciples in the Gaṅgā, and he called Sanandana who
<div n="lb"/>was on the other side of the river to go to him. Sanan-
<div n="lb"/>dana walked on the surface of the water to his Guru,
<div n="lb"/>and as he took each step a lotus flower appeared beneath
<div n="lb"/>and held him up from sinking into the water. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards he came to be called Padmapāda,
<div n="lb"/>and his colleagues also realised his greatness.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Hastāmalaka.%} Hastāmalaka was one of the best disci-
<div n="lb"/>ples of Śaṅkara. There is a story about his becoming
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara's disciple. He was born dumb. His father,
<div n="lb"/>Divākara took Hastāmalaka to Śaṅkara believing that
<div n="lb"/>due to the blessing of the great Guru his son would gain
<div n="lb"/>powers of speech. Śaṅkara asked the dumb boy, ‘who
<div n="lb"/>are you?’ and the boy answered, ‘I am the soul, which
<div n="lb"/>has no relationship with the parts and attributes of body
<div n="lb"/>and mind and which is also entirely different from them’.
<div n="lb"/>There were certain verses, which the boy recited as
<div n="lb"/>answer to Śaṅkara's question and each verse ended with
<div n="lb"/>‘nityopalabdhisvarūpohamātmā’ (I am the ātman and
<div n="lb"/>eternal knowledge, consciousness, is its characteristic).
<div n="lb"/>The boy's answer pleased Śaṅkara, who took him as a
<div n="lb"/>disciple of his. The boy was given sannyāsa under
<div n="lb"/>the name Hastāmalaka the meaning of which word is
<div n="lb"/>he who is in possession of knowledge like the goose-
<div n="lb"/>berry in one's palm.
[Page686-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Toṭakācārya.%} Toṭakācārya was a disciple, who came
<div n="lb"/>soon after Hastāmalaka. The name Toṭakācārya has a
<div n="lb"/>story behind it. This disciple approached Śaṅkara with
<div n="lb"/>his request for discipleship in verse praising the latter.
<div n="lb"/>The verses were composed in the difficult toṭaka metre.
<div n="lb"/>The verses attracted Śaṅkara very much and he took the
<div n="lb"/>applicant as disciple. His real name was Kalānātha, but
<div n="lb"/>the Guru named him Toṭakācārya in view of his verses
<div n="lb"/>in that metre.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The Caṇḍālaguru.%} There is a story about Śiva going
<div n="lb"/>to Śaṅkara at Kāśī in the guise of a Caṇḍāla and
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara receiving him. One morning Śaṅkara, after
<div n="lb"/>bathing in the Gaṅgā, was returning to the Viśvanātha
<div n="lb"/>temple. A Caṇḍāla with his hunting dogs and a pot of
<div n="lb"/>liquor was advancing from the opposite direction of
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara, who asked the former to move away from his
<div n="lb"/>path. Immediately the Caṇḍāla asked, which, the
<div n="lb"/>body or soul, is to remove itself from the path? The
<div n="lb"/>body of everybody is composed of blood, flesh, bones
<div n="lb"/>etc; the constitution of it also is the same. But, the
<div n="lb"/>Ātman is universal and omnipresent. Whom-which of
<div n="lb"/>the two-are you asking to move away from your path?
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara realised from the above answer that the Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>was an extraordinary person. In fact, it was Siva, who
<div n="lb"/>had disguised himself as a Caṇḍāla. Śaṅkara prostrated
<div n="lb"/>before him. Śaṅkara thought about God saying that
<div n="lb"/>he who had attained Brahman and the consciousness
<div n="lb"/>of oneness with all, was his Guru, whether he be a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin or a Caṇḍāla.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Derisive of the grammarian.%} Śaṅkara has composed
<div n="lb"/>a hymn named Mohamudgara, in which he ridicules a
<div n="lb"/>grammarian. One day walking along a street in Kāśī
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara saw a grammarian learning by rote rules of
<div n="lb"/>grammar, and then he composed the very sweet and beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful poem—Bhaja Govindam—to reveal the foolishness
<div n="lb"/>of the grammarian repeating the useless rules of gram-
<div n="lb"/>mar. By the very first verse of the poem Śaṅkara revealed
<div n="lb"/>the following truth: “Oh! fool! worship Govinda
<div n="lb"/>(Bhaja Govindam) meditate upon Him. You meditate
<div n="lb"/>upon Govinda realising the truth that when death
<div n="lb"/>approaches, the grammatical sūtra “Ḍukṛñ Karaṇe” will
<div n="lb"/>not come to your aid.”
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Saw Vyāsa.%} Śiva, when he appeared in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a Caṇḍāla to Śaṅkara, had asked him to visit Badari-
<div n="lb"/>kāśrama, and accordingly he went there and visited
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa. It was there that Śaṅkara met his supreme
<div n="lb"/>preceptor, Govindapāda. He returned to Kāśī with the
<div n="lb"/>blessings of Vyāsa and Govindapāda and engaged him-
<div n="lb"/>self in the writing of books.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Śaṅkara's age.%} There is a legend about Śaṅkara's
<div n="lb"/>life. Brahmā had allotted to him only eight years' life.
<div n="lb"/>Before Śaṅkara left his house at Kālaṭi, a batch of
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsins including Agastya and Nārada came to the
<div n="lb"/>house. The sannyāsins, who were pleased with the
<div n="lb"/>reception accorded to them blessed Śaṅkara to live for
<div n="lb"/>sixteen years instead of the eight Brahmā had permitted
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="NI"/>While Śaṅkara was writing books at Muktimaṇḍapa at
<div n="lb"/>Maṇikarṇikā Ghat in Kāśī Vyāsa came there one day
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of an old man, and there ensued a lengthy
<div n="lb"/>discussion between the two. Padmapāda recognised
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa in the old man and told him and Śaṅkara thus:
<div n="lb"/>“How would there be peace and happiness in the world,
<div n="lb"/>if Śaṅkara, the incarnation of Śiva and Vedavyāsa, the
[Page686-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Viṣṇu quarrelled with each other?” As
<div n="lb"/>soon as his identity was revealed thus, Vyāsa admitted
<div n="lb"/>that Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya on the Brahmasūtras was cor-
<div n="lb"/>rect and blessed him to live for thirtytwo, instead of
<div n="lb"/>sixteen years.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Controversy between Śaṅkara and Maṇḍanamiśra.%}
<div n="lb"/>Pandits (scholars) view the controversy or discussion
<div n="lb"/>between Śaṅkara and Maṇḍanamiśra as the most impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant event in Śaṅkara's life. Three incidents, Śaṅkara's
<div n="lb"/>meeting Kumārilabhaṭṭa, his defeating Maṇḍanamiśra
<div n="lb"/>and his entering the dead body of another person—may
<div n="lb"/>be found in connection with the above controversy.
<div n="NI"/>{%A: Meeting with Kumārilabhaṭṭa.%} Śaṅkara's object was
<div n="lb"/>to expose the defects and draw-backs in Pūrvamīmāṃsā
<div n="lb"/>(the ritual part of the Vedas). Kumārilabhaṭṭa was the
<div n="lb"/>most competent person for a discussion on the subject.
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara, for this purpose, went to Prayāga from Kāśī.
<div n="lb"/>But, Kumārilabhaṭṭa was not in a condition fit for dis-
<div n="lb"/>cussion. He was slowly burning himself to death in a
<div n="lb"/>heap of paddy husk set on fire. He courted this punish-
<div n="lb"/>ment voluntarily to atone for a wrong he had commit-
<div n="lb"/>ted. Years back he had put on Buddhistic attire and
<div n="lb"/>studied the secrets of Buddhistic religion from its precep-
<div n="lb"/>tors with the object of refuting that religion. Kumā-
<div n="lb"/>rilabhaṭṭa had great faith in Karmakāṇḍa, and he
<div n="lb"/>therefore, decided that it was his duty to make a tone-
<div n="lb"/>ment for the wrong he had purposely done according
<div n="lb"/>to injunctions laid down in Karmakāṇḍa. Śaṅkara was
<div n="lb"/>very sorry to find Kumārilabhaṭṭa in this condition in
<div n="lb"/>which discussion could not be held with him on the
<div n="lb"/>defects of Pūrvamīmāṃsā. Kumārilabhaṭṭa directed
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara to the great scholar, Maṇḍanamiśra at Māhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>matī for a discussion on Pūrvamīmāṃsā.
<div n="NI"/>{%B. Maṇḍanamiśra defeated.%} When Śaṅkara reached
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍanamiśra's house a ceremony connected with
<div n="lb"/>obsequies was being conducted there. The door for
<div n="lb"/>entry to the house was closed. Śaṅkara, by his yogic
<div n="lb"/>power entered the home and revealed the object of his
<div n="lb"/>visit to Maṇḍanamiśra, who agreed to the proposal of
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara. Accordingly a debate began between the two.
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratīdevī, wife of Maṇḍanamiśra and an erudite
<div n="lb"/>scholar in her own title acted as the arbiter in the discus-
<div n="lb"/>sion. Before the debate started she put a garland of
<div n="lb"/>flowers on the neck of both the contenders and announc-
<div n="lb"/>ed that he would be considered as defeated in the
<div n="lb"/>debate the garland on whose neck began fading first.
<div n="lb"/>The debate continued for a number of days and the
<div n="lb"/>garland on Maṇḍanamiśra's neck began showing signs
<div n="lb"/>of fading. According to the terms and conditions of
<div n="lb"/>the debate Maṇḍanamiśra acknowledged defeat. He
<div n="lb"/>accepted Śaṅkara's discipleship.
<div n="NI"/>{%C. Parakāyapraveśa (Entering the dead body of another%}
<div n="lb"/>{%person).%} But, Bhāratīdevī argued that it was not enough
<div n="lb"/>that Śaṅkara had defeated her husband in debate. She
<div n="lb"/>challenged him to defeat her as well, and Śaṅkara
<div n="lb"/>accepted the challenge. Many topics dealt with in
<div n="lb"/>the various Śāstras were debated upon and Śaṅkara
<div n="lb"/>won all those debates. Ultimately Bhāratīdevī raised
<div n="lb"/>certain points connected with the science of sexual
<div n="lb"/>love in the course of her arguments. Śaṅkara admitted
<div n="lb"/>that he did not possess sufficient mastery over the
<div n="lb"/>subject as he had taken himself to sannyāsa even from
<div n="lb"/>infancy. But, he told her that if he was allowed neces-
<div n="lb"/>sary time for it he would debate on that topic also.
[Page687-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratīdevī granted him time for it and the debate
<div n="lb"/>was adjourned.
<div n="NI"/>Śaṅkara prepared himself for the study of the science
<div n="lb"/>of sexual love. Just at that time a King called Amaruka
<div n="lb"/>died. After asking his disciples to take especial care
<div n="lb"/>of his body Śaṅkara entered by yogic power the dead
<div n="lb"/>body of Amaruka. The dead King came back to
<div n="lb"/>life and his people felt very happy about the mysteri-
<div n="lb"/>ous happening. Śaṅkara, who had thus entered the
<div n="lb"/>body of King Amaruka, lived in the palace enjoying
<div n="lb"/>all royal pleasures. He gained practical experience
<div n="lb"/>in the matter of sexual love from the queens in the
<div n="lb"/>palace. People found the resurrected King Amaruka
<div n="lb"/>to be better and more intelligent. The ministers suspect-
<div n="lb"/>ed that the soul which dwelt in the body of the king
<div n="lb"/>was of some one else. Under the impression
<div n="lb"/>that it might be that of some yogin the ministers
<div n="lb"/>deputed agents to various parts of the country to find
<div n="lb"/>out if there was anywhere the dead body of a yogī, and
<div n="lb"/>they found out Śaṅkara's body. It was about to be
<div n="lb"/>burnt on the pyre when the disciples of Śaṅkara met
<div n="lb"/>King Amaruka at the palace and informed him about
<div n="lb"/>these developments. Immediately Śaṅkara quitted
<div n="lb"/>his royal body and entered his own body now lying on
<div n="lb"/>the funeral pyre. He prayed to Śrīlakṣmīnarasiṃha and
<div n="lb"/>came out from the burning pyre.
<div n="NI"/>Śaṅkara returned immediately to Maṇḍanamiśra's
<div n="lb"/>house and the debate was started again. Bhāratīdevī
<div n="lb"/>realised that Śaṅkara could not be defeated in topics
<div n="lb"/>related to the science of sex. Thus Śaṅkara gained
<div n="lb"/>absolute victory in his debate with Maṇḍanamiśra, who
<div n="lb"/>then requested the former to grant him sannyāsa and
<div n="lb"/>accept him as a disciple. Śaṅkara did so. Bhāratīdevī
<div n="lb"/>too followed her husband in accepting sannyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Mother's death.%} Śaṅkara now knew that it was time
<div n="lb"/>for his mother's death. According to his promise to
<div n="lb"/>her that he would be by her side at the time of her
<div n="lb"/>death Śaṅkara returned to Kālaṭi. His mother expired,
<div n="lb"/>and he made arrangements for cremation. But his rela-
<div n="lb"/>tions did not cooperate with him and argued that it was
<div n="lb"/>against the injunctions in the Śāstras for a son, who had
<div n="lb"/>taken to sannyāsa, to perform the cremation etc. of his
<div n="lb"/>mother. At last, Śaṅkara had to cremate his mother by
<div n="lb"/>himself without others' help. He made a pyre with plan-
<div n="lb"/>tain stems in the compound of his house, and cut his
<div n="lb"/>mother's corpse into pieces, carried the pieces to the
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre and thus cremated the body.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Triumphal tour.%} After the cremation of his mother
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara set out on his triumphal tour of the country.
<div n="lb"/>He is believed to have travelled throughout India three
<div n="lb"/>times. Wherever he went he gained friends and also
<div n="lb"/>made enemies. It was during these tours that he esta-
<div n="lb"/>blished the four maṭhas (centres) in the four regions
<div n="lb"/>of the country. Śṛṅgeri in the south, Jaganātha in the
<div n="lb"/>east, Dvārakā in the west and Badarīnātha in the north
<div n="lb"/>were the four chief maṭhas established by Śaṅkara and
<div n="lb"/>they continue to function even to this day.
<div n="NI"/>The Śiva, Viṣṇu and Devī temples and other Hindu
<div n="lb"/>religious institutions to be found in India today very
<div n="lb"/>eloquently proclaim the achievements and unique
<div n="lb"/>reputation of Śaṅkara. It is traditionally believed that
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara brought five liṅgas from Kailāsa and installed
<div n="lb"/>them in the five great temples. Muktiliṅga in Kedāra,
<div n="lb"/>Paraliṅga in the Nīlakaṇṭha temple in Nepal, Mokṣa
<div n="lb"/>liṅga at Cidambaram, Bhogaliṅga in Śṛṅgeri and
[Page687-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Yogaliṅga in Kāñcī are the five liṅgas installed by
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara. The ‘five-in-one’ method of worship was
<div n="lb"/>also propounded by him. According to this system
<div n="lb"/>Āditya, Ambikā, Viṣṇu, Gaṇanātha and Maheśvara
<div n="lb"/>are conjointly worshipped, special importance being
<div n="lb"/>given by the worshipper to his special deity. Śaṅkara
<div n="lb"/>appointed one disciple of his each in each of the maṭhas
<div n="lb"/>as its head and these maṭhas play the most important role
<div n="lb"/>in the maintenance and propagation of the Advaita philo-
<div n="lb"/>sophy. The heads of these maṭhas during various periods
<div n="lb"/>have been reputed Vedāntists and noble souls. Jyotir-
<div n="lb"/>maṭha in Badarikāśrama, Govardhana pīṭha in Jagan-
<div n="lb"/>nāthapurī, Śāradā pīṭha in Śṛṅgeri and Kāmakoṭipīṭha
<div n="lb"/>in Kāñcī are the most important of the Śrī Śaṅkara pīṭhas.
<div n="lb"/>Having thus completed his philosophic mission or object
<div n="lb"/>in life Śaṅkara entered mahāsamādhi at the age of thirty-
<div n="lb"/>two. Some scholars believe that he disappeared in a
<div n="lb"/>cave at Kedāra while certain others hold the view that
<div n="lb"/>he ascended the Sarvajñapīṭha (the omniscient state) at
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcī and spent his closing days there.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%His works.%} The literary compositions of Śaṅkara may
<div n="lb"/>be classified into four divisions, viz, Bhāṣyas (comment-
<div n="lb"/>aries), original works, hymns to various deities, and
<div n="lb"/>mantras.
