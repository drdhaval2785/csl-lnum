<div n="lb"/>during the churning of the Ocean of Milk. Śiva swallow-
<div n="lb"/>ed and retained it in his throat, and so he came to

<div n="NI"/>“And Kālakūṭa arose like fire burning all the worlds.
<div n="lb"/>The smell of it sent the three worlds into a swoon.
<div n="lb"/>At the request of Brahmā Śiva swallowed the poison to
<div n="lb"/>save the world from absolute destruction. And, he
<div n="lb"/>(Śiva) retained it in his throat”. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
