MĀTARIŚVAN¦. A devatā (demigod). There are
<div n="lb"/>several stories in the Vedas regarding the birth of Agni
<div n="lb"/>(fire). Though Agni originating from the clouds rea-
<div n="lb"/>ches the earth as lightning it hides itself making it invisi-
<div n="lb"/>ble to man. It was Mātariśvan who took its form from
<div n="lb"/>the earth and gave it to the Bhṛgu family and made it
<div n="lb"/>possible for them to make it as and when it was requir-
<div n="lb"/>ed. (Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>This Mātariśvan was one of the prominent sons of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa. (Śloka 14, Chapter 10, Udyoga Parva).
