PAKAL¦. Malayālam word meaning Day. A story about
<div n="lb"/>the origin of day, night, dawn and dusk is contained in
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa. At the time of the great Deluge every-
<div n="lb"/>thing from gods down to the rocks lay submerged in
<div n="lb"/>Parabrahman (Supreme Being). Brahmā sat in medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation to initiate what he termed as Jagatsṛṣṭi, the
<div n="lb"/>four species of living beings like the devas, asuras, pitṛs
<div n="lb"/>and men. When the meditation proceeded, the Tamoguṇa
<div n="lb"/>in Brahmā became prominent and so first and foremost
<div n="lb"/>of all, the asuras were born from his waist. Then
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā discarded his Tamoguṇa and the manifestation
<div n="lb"/>of the discarded Tamoguṇa became Night. Brahmā sat
<div n="lb"/>again in meditation and from his face sprang out the
<div n="lb"/>devas, who were embodiments of sattvaguṇa. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>discarded the sattvaguṇa and it then became Day. That is
<div n="lb"/>why asuras are powerful at night and devas by day.
<div n="lb"/>Then another manifestation with sattvaguṇa predominat-
<div n="lb"/>ing sprang out from Brahmā and it was called Pitṛs.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā discarded that also and it became Dusk.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā sat again in meditation and then were born
<div n="lb"/>men who were a manifestation of Rajoguṇa. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>discarded that also and it then became Dawn. That is
<div n="lb"/>why men are strong at dawn and the pitṛs strong at
<div n="lb"/>dusk. It is because of these that it is said that day,
<div n="lb"/>night, dawn and dusk are bodies of Brahmā. All the
<div n="lb"/>above four are an asylum of the three guṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Night is called Uṣā and day, Vyuṣṭi. Sandhyā (dusk)
<div n="lb"/>is the time between Uṣā and Vyuṣṭi. When the fierce
<div n="lb"/>and terrible Sandhyā commences, a set of ferocious
<div n="lb"/>demons called Mandehas desire to eat the Sun. A fight
<div n="lb"/>ensues then between the Sun and the demons and by a
<div n="lb"/>curse of Prajāpati the demons die daily though their
<div n="lb"/>bodies never perish. At that time the best of Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>with the sound of ‘OM’ vibrating recite the gāyatrī and
<div n="lb"/>throw water upwards. That water transforms itself into
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāyudha and burns to death the wicked demons.
<div n="lb"/>The first oblation to the sacrificial fire is performed
<div n="lb"/>reciting the mantra which begins with “Sūryojyotiḥ”.
<div n="lb"/>‘OM’ is but Bhagavān Viṣṇu, lord of the Vedas with
<div n="lb"/>the lustre of Ṛk, Yajus and Sāma. The very utterance of
<div n="lb"/>the word ‘OM’ therefore, destroys the demons
<div n="lb"/>Mandehas. (Chapter 8, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 5, Aṃśa 1,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
