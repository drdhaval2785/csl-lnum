VĪRABHADRA¦. One of the guards of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} There are two different opinions in the Purā-
<div n="lb"/>ṇas, regarding the origin of Vīrabhadra. There is no
<div n="lb"/>doubt that his birth was due to the anger of Śiva. When
<div n="lb"/>Śiva knew that his wife Pārvatī jumped into the fire and
<div n="lb"/>died at the sacrifice of Dakṣa, he struck his matted hair
<div n="lb"/>on the ground and from that, Vīrabhadra and Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>kālī came into being. This is the version given in Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7. According to Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 284, Vīrabhadra was born from
<div n="lb"/>the mouth of Śiva. From each of the hairpores of Vīra-
<div n="lb"/>bhadra, who was born from the mouth of Śiva to destroy
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice of Dakṣa a fearful monster was born, all
<div n="lb"/>of whom, formed a group of ghosts called the Raumyas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The Destruction of the sacrifice of Dakṣa.%} See under
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Attainment of boon.%} After the destruction of the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice of Dakṣa, the fearful monster Vīrabhadra, began to
<div n="lb"/>exterminate the entire creation. Then Śiva appeared
<div n="lb"/>and pacified him and said “You shall become a planet
<div n="lb"/>in the sky called Aṅgarakṣaka (Bodyguard) or Maṅgala
<div n="lb"/>(well being). Everybody will worship you. Those who
<div n="lb"/>thus exalt you, will get health, wealth and long life.”
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 7; Vāyu Purāṇa, 101, 209; Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, 24).
<div n="NI"/>After the destruction of the sacrifice of Dakṣa, Vīra-
<div n="lb"/>bhadra severed a portion of his radiance, and from that
<div n="lb"/>radiance, later Ādiśaṅkara (Śaṅkarācārya) was born.
<div n="lb"/>This story occurs in Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Pratisarga Parva.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Prowess.%} Vīrabhadra was not only a follower of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. He was a prominent general of the army. In the
<div n="lb"/>battle of the burning of Tripura and the Jalandhara
<div n="lb"/>fight, Vīrabhadra stood with Śiva and fought fiercely.
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa and Uttara Khaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Protector of the Devas.%} Vīrabhadra was the destroyer
<div n="lb"/>of the Asuras and the protector of the Devas. Once
[Page859-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa and all the other hermits and sages with him
<div n="lb"/>were burnt to ashes in the wild fire that occurred in the
<div n="lb"/>Śaukaṭa mountain. Instantly Vīrabhadra swallowed
<div n="lb"/>that wild fire and by the power of incantation, he bro-
<div n="lb"/>ught to life from the ashes all the Ṛṣis (hermits) who
<div n="lb"/>were burnt to death.
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion a serpent swallowed all the gods.
<div n="lb"/>Vīrabhadra killed the snake and rescued all the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>Once an asura called Pañcameḍhra put into his mouth
<div n="lb"/>all the gods, all the hermits and Bāli and Sugrīva.
<div n="lb"/>Those who escaped from the danger stood agape being
<div n="lb"/>powerless to confront the Asura. At last Vīrabhadra
<div n="lb"/>attacked the asura. That great and fierce battle lasted
<div n="lb"/>for years. At the end Vīrabhadra killed the Asura and
<div n="lb"/>rescued all.
<div n="NI"/>Because Vīrabhadra had thus protected the Devas and
<div n="lb"/>the others on three occasions, Śiva became immensely
<div n="lb"/>pleased with him and gave him several boons. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, 107).
