VARGĀ¦. A celestial maid. There is a story in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 220, describing how Vargā
<div n="lb"/>and her friends were changed into crocodiles and had
<div n="lb"/>to live in water for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived an ‘apsaras’ (celestial maid) named
<div n="lb"/>Vargā in Devāraṇya. She had four friends called
<div n="lb"/>Saurabheyī, Samīcī, Budbudā and Latā. Once they were
<div n="lb"/>going to the house of Kubera their patron. On the way
<div n="lb"/>they saw a hermit. They saw the whole forest
<div n="lb"/>shining with the radiance of the power of penance
<div n="lb"/>of the hermit. They decided to entice the hermit
[Page831-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>somehow. With this intention they entered
<div n="lb"/>his hermitage. Seeing their dalliance and co-
<div n="lb"/>quetry, the hermit got angry and cursed them to
<div n="lb"/>become crocodiles for a hundred years. They implored
<div n="lb"/>him with tears, for liberation from the curse. The
<div n="lb"/>hermit told them that in due course a noble man would
<div n="lb"/>come and get them out of water and that then they
<div n="lb"/>would obtain their original form. They walked towards
<div n="lb"/>a lake.
<div n="NI"/>On the way they saw Nārada. They told him every-
<div n="lb"/>thing. He told them. “On the coast of the southern
<div n="lb"/>ocean there are five tīrthas (holy baths) known as
<div n="lb"/>Agastya, Saubhadra, Pauloma, Kārandhama and
<div n="lb"/>Suprasanna. You may go to these lakes and live there
<div n="lb"/>as crocodiles one in each. In due course Arjuna, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṇḍu will come and redeem you.”
<div n="NI"/>According to the words of Nārada the five celestial
<div n="lb"/>maids walked to the south and reached the Pañcatīrtha
<div n="lb"/>(the five holy baths) and each of them entered a lake
<div n="lb"/>as a crocodile. After this nobody dared to live near
<div n="lb"/>those holy baths. After some time Arjuna started on his
<div n="lb"/>pilgrimage. He passed through many places and reach-
<div n="lb"/>ed the Pañcatīrtha. He enquired why the place was
<div n="lb"/>forsaken by people. The hermits told him that there
<div n="lb"/>was a crocodile in each of the five baths and that they
<div n="lb"/>would eat anybody who got into the bath. Arjuna got
<div n="lb"/>into a lake. Immediately a crocodile came and caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of him. With great difficulty he dragged it out of
<div n="lb"/>the lake. Instantly the crocodile changed into a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful damsel. The celestial maid Vargā told the amazed
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna her story and she added that her four friends
<div n="lb"/>were lying in the neighbouring four lakes. Arjuna redeem-
<div n="lb"/>ed every one of them. After this, Vargā and her
<div n="lb"/>friends went to Devāraṇya and Arjuna to Maṇalūra.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards the five tīrthas came to be known
<div n="lb"/>as Nārītīrthas.
