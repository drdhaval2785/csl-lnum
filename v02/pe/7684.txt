<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ugrasena became king.%} Ugrasena became king of Mathu-
<div n="lb"/>rāpurī. His Kingship was not a hereditary acquisition.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story behind it. In olden days, in the plateau
<div n="lb"/>of Kālindī there was a famous place called Madhuvana.
<div n="lb"/>The place was called so because it was the abode of an
<div n="lb"/>Asura named Madhu. Madhu had a son, Lavaṇa. Śatru-
<div n="lb"/>ghna killed him as he was a very troublesome fellow
<div n="lb"/>and a thorn on the side of the Devas. Śatrughna then
<div n="lb"/>established a beautiful kingdom there and ruled it. He
<div n="lb"/>named it Mathurā. After the death of Śatrughna his
<div n="lb"/>two sons ruled Mathurā. Then, when the Solar dynasty
<div n="lb"/>came to its end, Mathurā came under the Yādavas.
<div n="lb"/>A Yādava king called Śūrasena ruled over the kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Śūrasena.
<div n="lb"/>After the death of his father Vasudeva took up the pro-
<div n="lb"/>fession of herding cows, and therefore Ugrasena,
<div n="lb"/>another king of the Yādava dynasty had to become king
<div n="lb"/>of Mathurā. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ugrasena and Kaṃsa.%} There is a common belief that
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa was the son of Ugrasena. But, the Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>relates the following to the effect that Kaṃsa was born
<div n="lb"/>to a Gandharva called Dramila of Ugrasena's wife.
<div n="NI"/>When once Ugrasena's wife was in her monthly periods,
<div n="lb"/>she walked in the forest with her companions. A Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva called Dramila saw her then, felt attracted by her
<div n="lb"/>and made her pregnant. Angered at this, she cursed
<div n="lb"/>Dramila thus: “Since you have procreated a son in me,
<div n="lb"/>while I am in my periods this son will be killed by a
<div n="lb"/>boy born in my husband's family.” Kaṃsa was the son
<div n="lb"/>born to her in the above manner. Kaṃsa ascended the
<div n="lb"/>throne after putting Ugrasena in prison. According to the
<div n="lb"/>curse of Ugrasena's wife, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was born in Ugra-
<div n="lb"/>sena's family and he killed Kaṃsa. Nārada had informed
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa of the Dramila interlude. Kaṃsa told this story
<div n="lb"/>secretly to Akrūra when the latter was deputed by him
<div n="lb"/>to invite Kṛṣṇa to the dhanur yajña. (Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>{%The name Āhuka.%} Genealogy states that Ugrasena was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Āhuka. But, in certain contexts Ugrasena
<div n="lb"/>is called Āhuka also. “Afterwards we made Āhuka-
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena King...” (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>128, Verse 39).
[Page805-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ugrasena imprisoned.%} Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was Ugrasena's minister. Kaṃsa, when he attained
<div n="lb"/>majority imprisoned Ugrasena and became himself king.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 22).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Ugrasena regained kingdom.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa with
<div n="lb"/>the permission of Ugrasena and made him king again.
<div n="lb"/>During the reign of Ugrasena, Jarāsandha and Śālva
<div n="lb"/>attacked Mathurāpurī. (See under Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Ugrasena and the iron rod.%} While Ugrasena was ruling
<div n="lb"/>the Kingdom, the sages Viśvāmitra, Nārada and Kañja
<div n="lb"/>once came to Dvārakā. To insult the sages, the Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>brought before them, Sāmba dressed as a pregnant
<div n="lb"/>woman. The Yādavas told the sages that she was Babhru's
<div n="lb"/>wife, and wanted to be told whether the child she deli-
<div n="lb"/>vered would be male or female. The sages understood
<div n="lb"/>their evil mentality, and prophesied that Sāmba would
<div n="lb"/>deliver an iron rod fierce enough to annihilate the
<div n="lb"/>whole Yādava race. According to the prophecy the
<div n="lb"/>next day Sāmba delivered an iron rod. The Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>imparted the news to Ugrasena, who got the iron rod
<div n="lb"/>reduced to powder and deposited the powder in the sea.
<div n="lb"/>He also enforced prohibition of liquor in the country.
<div n="lb"/>(To know how the powder of the rod ruined the Yādava
<div n="lb"/>dynasty see under Kṛṣṇa). (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%After death.%} After his death, Ugrasena joined the
<div n="lb"/>Viśvadevatās. Bhūriśravas, Śala, Bhūri, Kaṃsa-
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena, Vasudeva, Uttara with his brother Śaṅkha-
<div n="lb"/>these kings (after death) joined the company of Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>devatās. (M.B. Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5, Verses
<div n="lb"/>16, 17).
