KUŚA II¦. One of the two sons of Śrī Rāma, the other,
<div n="lb"/>being Lava.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} To Sītā forsaken by Rāma a son called Lava
<div n="lb"/>was born while she was living at the āśrama of Vālmīki.
<div n="lb"/>One day Sītā took Lava to the stream to bathe him,
<div n="lb"/>and Vālmīki, who did not know about it was upset not
<div n="lb"/>to see the child in the āśrama. He feared that it might
<div n="lb"/>have been eaten up by some animal, and fearing that
<div n="lb"/>Sītā might die when she missed the child he created a
<div n="lb"/>child with Kuśa grass and laid it where Lava was lying
<div n="lb"/>before. When Sītā returned to the āśrama with Lava
<div n="lb"/>after their bath Vālmīki explained the whole situation
<div n="lb"/>to Sītā. Since the second child was created with Kuśa
<div n="lb"/>grass he was called Kuśa, and he was made the second
<div n="lb"/>son of Sītā (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa and Kathāsaritsāgara,
<div n="lb"/>Alaṅkāravatīlambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kuśa went to Ayodhyā.%} Śrī Rāma decided to conduct
<div n="lb"/>an Aśvamedha yajña. It was ordained that the emperor,
<div n="lb"/>who conducted a yajña should have his wife. As Sītā
<div n="lb"/>had been abandoned, Rāma had no wife for the pur-
<div n="lb"/>poses of the yajña. It was laid down that in the absence
<div n="lb"/>of the wife a statue of hers may be made with palāśa
<div n="lb"/>wood. But, Vasiṣṭha decreed that a statue of Sītā
<div n="lb"/>might be made with gold. The yajña was to be held
<div n="lb"/>in the Naimiṣa forest. During the triumphal tour of
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna with the yājñika horse he reached the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the river Tamasā near the āśrama of Vālmīki where
[Page446-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Lava and Kuśa captured the horse. Śatrughna could
<div n="lb"/>not defeat Lava and Kuśa, and they routed the addi-
<div n="lb"/>tional force also which arrived under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa to help Śatrughna. Then Vālmīki intervened
<div n="lb"/>and the horse was returned to Śatrughna. Afterwards,
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki, Sītā and Lavakuśas also attended Śrī Rāma's
<div n="lb"/>yajña where Lava and Kuśa recited the poem Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa composed by Vālmīki. Rāma recognised the boys
<div n="lb"/>and they were made to live in Ayodhyā. Thus did
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa visit Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>The Kathāsaritsāgara tells the following story about
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa's visit to Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Vālmīki duly performed the thread-wearing ceremony
<div n="lb"/>of Lava and Kuśa and taught them, even in their very
<div n="lb"/>childhood, all arts and sciences including the secrets
<div n="lb"/>about divine arrows. The boys one day killed a deer in
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama and worshipped with its flesh the liṅga, which
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki used to worship daily, and as a result of that
<div n="lb"/>the sage became ill. Sītādevī requested for penance for
<div n="lb"/>the action of her children, and Vālmīki said that Lava
<div n="lb"/>should bring golden lotus flowers from Vaiśravaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>pond and flowers of Kalpakavṛkṣa from his garden, and
<div n="lb"/>that Lava and Kuśa together should worship the
<div n="lb"/>Śivaliṅga with those flowers. Lava then went to mount
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa and after killing many yakṣas collected the
<div n="lb"/>flowers. On his way back he rested for some time at the
<div n="lb"/>foot of a tree. Just then Lakṣmaṇa, who was on the
<div n="lb"/>look-out for a human being for the naramedha (human
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice) of Śrī Rāma, also reached the spot. He
<div n="lb"/>decided to take Lava captive with him, and they fought
<div n="lb"/>with each other for some time. At last Lakṃaṇa
<div n="lb"/>took Lava captive by using mohanāstra (arrow which
<div n="lb"/>makes the opponent unconscious) and took him to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. Sītā was pained that Lava had not returned
<div n="lb"/>yet, and Vālmīki with his divine vision understood the
<div n="lb"/>reason for his absence. He deputed Kuśa to Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>to bring back with him Lava somehow or other. When
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa reached Ayodhyā, Śrī Rāma was conducting the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha yajña, and Kuśa, successfully confronting a
<div n="lb"/>number of people, got into the yajña ground. In the
<div n="lb"/>combat that ensued between Kuśa and Lakṣmaṇa the
<div n="lb"/>latter was defeated, as he could not defeat Kuśa due to
<div n="lb"/>the greatness of Vālmīki. When Śrī Rāma asked
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa who he was he replied that he was the brother
<div n="lb"/>of Lava and that he had heard from his mother Sītā
<div n="lb"/>that both of them were the sons of Śrī Rāma. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>was overjoyed to hear that and he covered the boys
<div n="lb"/>with kisses. Sītā also was brought down from the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>of Vālmīki, and all of them lived very happily. (Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara, Alaṃkāravatīlambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kuśa's reign.%} Following the demise of Lakṣmaṇa Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma divided the country between Kuśa and Lava. A
<div n="lb"/>city called Kuśāvatī was built in the Kosala Kingdom
<div n="lb"/>and Kuśa was crowned King thereof. Thirtytwo out
<div n="lb"/>of the sixtyfour akṣauhiṇīs of the kings of the solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty, four out of the eight ministers and half of the
<div n="lb"/>movable property were allotted to Kuśa. Lava was
<div n="lb"/>crowned king of north Kosala where a city called
<div n="lb"/>Śarāvatī was built for him, and the other half of the
<div n="lb"/>army, ministers etc. became his share. While Kuśa and
<div n="lb"/>Lava were ruling the country thus, Śrī Rāma immolated
<div n="lb"/>himself in the depths of the river Sarayū (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%Kuśa's successors.%} Descended from Śrī Rāma thus:
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa—Aditi—Niṣadha—Nabhas—Puṇḍarīka—Kṣema-
[Page446-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>dhanvā—Devānīka—Ṛkṣa—Pāriyātra—Vindorala—
<div n="lb"/>Vajranābha—Khagaṇa—Vīdhṛti—Hiraṇyanābha—
<div n="lb"/>Puṣya—Dhruva—Sudarśana—Agnipūrṇa—Śīghra—
<div n="lb"/>Maru. The solar dynasty was annihilated at the advent
<div n="lb"/>of Kaliyuga (Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha).
