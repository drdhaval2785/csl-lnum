DEVAŚARMĀ II¦. A Brahmin, an erudite scholar in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. His story was once told to Pārvatī by Śiva as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Devaśarman, the very erudite brahmin scholar in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas came to be much respected by the people of the
<div n="lb"/>four varṇas (Castes) because of his constant and unfail-
<div n="lb"/>ing performance of the various religious duties and
<div n="lb"/>rites like the Agnihotra etc. He had sons, relations and
<div n="lb"/>cows in abundance. But, he did not observe the śukla-
<div n="lb"/>pañcamī in Proṣṭhapada (Bhādrapada) which is one of
[Page212-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the dvādaśacāndra māsas (the 12 solar months).
<div n="lb"/>That day was his father's death anniversary (Śrāddha
<div n="lb"/>day) for which he would invite Brahmins on the pre-
<div n="lb"/>vious evening. And, in the morning he would get cook-
<div n="lb"/>ed rice by his wife in 18 different ways for the gratifica-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the departed soul. Then will he feed the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmins. On one such day he duly treated a Brāhmin
<div n="lb"/>versed in the Vedas. In the evening when he
<div n="lb"/>was washing his feet with water brought by his wife
<div n="lb"/>he heard the following conversation between a dog
<div n="lb"/>and an ox.
<div n="NI"/>{%Dog :%}—Please attend to my words about what my
<div n="lb"/>daughter-in-law did. One day, as fate would have it,
<div n="lb"/>I went to my son's house, where a snake was drinking
<div n="lb"/>milk, and I drank the whole of the milk which was left
<div n="lb"/>over by it. My daughter-in-law saw me drinking it and
<div n="lb"/>I was absolutely crest-fallen. I don't feel any yearning
<div n="lb"/>even for food.
<div n="NI"/>{%Ox :%}—Now dog, please attend to my sorrow and grief.
<div n="lb"/>Today my son feasted the Brahmins, but he did not even
<div n="lb"/>think of me. Nobody gave me even a blade of grass or
<div n="lb"/>a drop of water. I have not tasted anything today.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover I am a captive also. All this must be the result
<div n="lb"/>of some sin committed by me in my past life; no doubt
<div n="lb"/>about it.”
<div n="NI"/>The very learned and intelligent brahmin inferred from
<div n="lb"/>the above talk that the dog and ox were his mother and
<div n="lb"/>his father respectively. He thought to himself: they have
<div n="lb"/>been born as animals in my house. What remedy shall
<div n="lb"/>I find out therefor?
<div n="NI"/>On account of such painful thoughts the Brahmin could
<div n="lb"/>not sleep in the night. Early in the morning he went
<div n="lb"/>to sage Vasiṣṭha and unburdened his heart to him and
<div n="lb"/>requested him to find a solution to the low and mean
<div n="lb"/>birth which had become his parents’ fate. After medita-
<div n="lb"/>ting for some time the great sage told the brahmin as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Look here, the ox was, in its previous birth, a great
<div n="lb"/>brahmin in Kuṇḍinanagara. He did not observe the
<div n="lb"/>Śukla-pañcamī in the month of Proṣṭhapada, the day
<div n="lb"/>being the death anniversary of his father. His wife had
<div n="lb"/>menstruation on the same day, but she herself feasted
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins. A woman is impure during the four days
<div n="lb"/>of menstruation. Because of having feasted the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mins on the first day of her monthly period the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min's wife was born as a dog. As for the husband, he
<div n="lb"/>was born an ox as he not only did not observe the
<div n="lb"/>Śukla-pañcamī day, but also shared the sin of his wife.
<div n="lb"/>Further questioned by the brahmin as to what he should
<div n="lb"/>do for the salvation of his parents, Vasiṣṭha advised him
<div n="lb"/>to observe the Ṛṣi pañcamī in the month of Proṣṭhapada
<div n="lb"/>(Bhādrapada). He did so and his parents blessed him
<div n="lb"/>and attained salvation. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 78).
