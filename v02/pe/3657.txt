KṚŚĀŚVA I¦. The Prajāpati called Kṛśāśva married
<div n="lb"/>Jayā and Suprabhā the daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati
<div n="lb"/>and to both were born fifty sons each. All the sons were
<div n="lb"/>really arrows called Saṃhāra. Viśvāmitra, by the power
<div n="lb"/>of penance made these hundred sons (arrows) of Kṛśā-
<div n="lb"/>śva his own. It was these arrows, which Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>gave to Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, Cantos 21 and 26).
