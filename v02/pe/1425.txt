CAṆḌAMUṆḌAS¦. Two brothers born in the Asura
<div n="lb"/>dynasty, the elder brother being called Caṇḍa and
<div n="lb"/>the younger Muṇḍa. These brothers collected, like
<div n="lb"/>the other asura leaders Dhūmrākṣa, and Raktabīja,
<div n="lb"/>thousands of soldiers and lived in all pomp and
<div n="lb"/>glory.
<div n="NI"/>During this period two asura brothers called Śumbha
<div n="lb"/>and Niśumbha had returned from the Himālayas after
<div n="lb"/>securing from Brahman a boon that they would meet
<div n="lb"/>with their death only at the hands of a woman. Caṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Muṇḍa became their friends and attendants.
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha and Niśumbha set out on a triumphal tour
<div n="lb"/>and conquered heaven, earth and pātāla. The Devas
[Page170-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>took refuge in a forest. After wandering in the forest
<div n="lb"/>for a long time, at the instance of Bṛhaspati they sought
<div n="lb"/>asylum with Pārvatī. Pārvatī stood for sometime in deep
<div n="lb"/>concentration, and there emerged from her divine body
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣikī or Kālī. Pārvatī assured the Devas that she
<div n="lb"/>would kill Śumbha and Niśumbha. And, then Kālī sat
<div n="lb"/>alone on a rock in the thick Forest. Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>who happened to pass that way were attracted by the
<div n="lb"/>great beauty of Pārvatī and imparted the news to
<div n="lb"/>Śumbha and Niśumbha, and they deputed Dhūmrākṣa
<div n="lb"/>and 60,000 soldiers to bring Pārvatī over to them; but
<div n="lb"/>by one huṃkāra (sound ‘hum’) she reduced them to
<div n="lb"/>ashes. Ultimately she killed Śumbha and Niśumbha
<div n="lb"/>also. (Devī Bhāgavata, Pañcama Skandha).
