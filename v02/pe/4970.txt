PĀÑCĀLĪ¦. Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>i). {%Previous births.%} Pāñcālī had many previous births.
<div n="lb"/>During all these births many gods blessed her saying
<div n="lb"/>that she would have five husbands when she was born
<div n="lb"/>as the daughter of Drupada. Stories about her previous
<div n="lb"/>births lying scattered in the Purāṇas are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Māyāsītā.%} When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were in
<div n="lb"/>exile in the forest with Sītā, Agni came to Rāma once
<div n="lb"/>and told him in private thus: “Oh Rāma, you have
<div n="lb"/>incarnated on earth to kill Rāvaṇa. The time for that
<div n="lb"/>is drawing nigh and ere long Rāvaṇa would carry away
<div n="lb"/>Sītā. It is not proper that Sītā, the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī, should be touched by Rāvaṇa. Therefore I
<div n="lb"/>shall keep Sītā safe with me and I am giving you a
<div n="lb"/>phantom Sītā to be with you in her stead.” Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>took the Māyāsītā from Agni without even Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>knowing it and handed over the original Sītā to the
<div n="lb"/>custody of Agni.
<div n="NI"/>While thus Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Māyāsītā were
<div n="lb"/>living together in their hermitage a golden deer was
<div n="lb"/>seen one day in the precincts of their āśrama. Sītā
<div n="lb"/>was enamoured of the beautiful deer and wanted it. So
<div n="lb"/>Rāma keeping Lakṣmaṇa to watch over Sītā went in
<div n="lb"/>search of the deer. Śrī Rāma tried his best to capture
<div n="lb"/>the deer alive. But all his efforts failed and by that
<div n="lb"/>time he had come far from the āśrama following the
<div n="lb"/>deer. So he discharged an arrow and killed it. While
<div n="lb"/>falling dead the deer raised a cry imitating that of
<div n="lb"/>Rāma's and called Lakṣmaṇa for help. The deer was
<div n="lb"/>none other than Mārīca, the uncle of Rāvaṇa. On
<div n="lb"/>hearing the call for help Lakṣmaṇa rushed to the spot
<div n="lb"/>from where the sound came and Sītā was left alone
[Page549-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>for some time. Rāvaṇa came to the āśrama at that
<div n="lb"/>time and took the Māyāsītā away to Laṅkā.
<div n="NI"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went to Laṅkā with an army of
<div n="lb"/>monkeys and after killing Rāvaṇa took back Sītā to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. Then Rāma in deference to public opinion
<div n="lb"/>put Sītā into the fire to test her purity. At that time
<div n="lb"/>god Agni taking back Māyāsītā gave the real Sītā to
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, unscathed by the fire. Then, when Māyāsītā
<div n="lb"/>was thus abandoned by Rāma she bowed down before
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma and Agni and asked them thus “What am I
<div n="lb"/>to do now? Where should I go?” They advised her
<div n="lb"/>to go to Puṣkara and do penance there and blessed
<div n="lb"/>her saying that at the successful end of her penance
<div n="lb"/>she would become Svargalakṣmī. Paramaśiva was
<div n="lb"/>pleased by her penance and appearing before her
<div n="lb"/>asked her what boon she wanted. Māyāsītā who had
<div n="lb"/>become Svargalakṣmī by then requested Śiva to give
<div n="lb"/>her a husband. She repeated the request ‘Patiṃ dehi’
<div n="lb"/>(Give me a husband) five times and Śiva said that she
<div n="lb"/>would have five husbands in her next life as the daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter of the King of Pāñcāla with the name Kṛṣṇā.
<div n="lb"/>(9th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Nālāyaṇī (Indrasenā).%} Once there was an aged sage
<div n="lb"/>named Maudgalya. Nālāyaṇī alias Indrasenā was the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Maudgalya. Even though the wife was young
<div n="lb"/>and the husband old, Nālāyaṇī was very chaste. The
<div n="lb"/>sage became very old, grey-haired and rugous, skeleton-
<div n="lb"/>like with a foul smell emanating from his body. He
<div n="lb"/>was always in an angry mood. Still Nālāyaṇī stuck to
<div n="lb"/>him as a chaste, loving and dutiful wife. As time
<div n="lb"/>passed on Maudgalya became a leper. One day while
<div n="lb"/>the sage was eating, a finger of his broke and fell into
<div n="lb"/>the rice. With great calmness and devotion Nālāyaṇī
<div n="lb"/>removed the finger from the rice and ate the rice.
<div n="lb"/>Greatly pleased at this act of hers the sage asked her
<div n="lb"/>what boon she wanted an she replied she desired to
<div n="lb"/>have an amorous life with him as Pañcaśarīra. Maud-
<div n="lb"/>galya granted her the boon and they both travelled
<div n="lb"/>the whole world enjoying an amorous life. When the
<div n="lb"/>sage took the form of a mountain Nālāyaṇī became a
<div n="lb"/>river and when the sage took the shape of a flowering
<div n="lb"/>tree she became a creeper on it. They spent
<div n="lb"/>thousands of years like that and then Maudgalya
<div n="lb"/>became tired of a sexual life and returned to the
<div n="lb"/>ascetic life. Even after such a long period of erotic
<div n="lb"/>life Nālāyaṇī was still lustful and she resented the
<div n="lb"/>decision of her husband to go back to the life of a
<div n="lb"/>hermit. She begged her husband to continue the
<div n="lb"/>same life for some more time. Maudgalya got cross
<div n="lb"/>when she thus caused hindrance to his penance and
<div n="lb"/>cursed her saying that she would in her next life be
<div n="lb"/>born as the daughter of the King of Pāñcāla when she
<div n="lb"/>would have five husbands to satisfy her lust. Greatly
<div n="lb"/>grieved at this curse she practised severe austerities
<div n="lb"/>standing in the midst of Pañcāgni. Pleased with her
<div n="lb"/>penance Śiva appeared before her and blessed her say-
<div n="lb"/>ing that she would be born in her next birth in a very
<div n="lb"/>noble family and she would then have five husbands,
<div n="lb"/>good-natured, doing godly work and equal in valour
<div n="lb"/>to Indra. She then pleaded that she should be
<div n="lb"/>granted the boon to remain a virgin during the coitus
<div n="lb"/>with each of her husbands. Śiva granted that wish.
<div n="lb"/>Then Śiva sent her to the river Gaṅgā, and asked her
<div n="lb"/>to fetch a beautiful young man whom she would be
[Page549-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>seeing there. Accordingly she went to the river to do
<div n="lb"/>as she was directed.
<div n="NI"/>At that time all the devas joined together and perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed a Yāga at Naimiṣāraṇya. Kāla, the god of
<div n="lb"/>Death, was one of the chief priests for the function.
<div n="lb"/>The Yāga lasted for a long time and since Kāla was
<div n="lb"/>consecrated for the Yāga he did not attend to his
<div n="lb"/>duties as the god of Death. Death came to a dead
<div n="lb"/>stop and men increased in alarming numbers and the
<div n="lb"/>devas were perplexed. They went to Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>acquainted him with the frightening situation. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>sent them to Naimiṣāraṇya. They went there and were
<div n="lb"/>talking to Kāla when they saw a few golden flowers
<div n="lb"/>coming down the river. Getting curious Indra walked
<div n="lb"/>up the river to locate the origin of these flowers. When
<div n="lb"/>he reached the place of origin of Gaṅgā he saw
<div n="lb"/>Nālāyaṇī there. Nālāyaṇī took the beautiful young
<div n="lb"/>man to Śiva. Śiva was at that time engaged in a
<div n="lb"/>game of dice with Pārvatī and Indra did not then re-
<div n="lb"/>cognise Śiva. Indra in his arrogance argued that the
<div n="lb"/>whole universe belonged to him. Śiva jumped up
<div n="lb"/>enraged and ran after Indra who ran to the mouth of
<div n="lb"/>a cave. Śiva caught him and said that he would show
<div n="lb"/>him four Indras inside that cave. Both of them entered
<div n="lb"/>the cave and to the amazement of Indra he saw four
<div n="lb"/>other Indras sitting inside the cave. They were all the
<div n="lb"/>creation of Śiva and with the original Indra the
<div n="lb"/>number of Indras came to five. Then addressing
<div n="lb"/>Nālāyaṇī who had followed them Śiva said, “Oh
<div n="lb"/>beautiful girl, do not be worried. All these five are
<div n="lb"/>your husbands. You will be born as the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>the King of Pāñcāla. Then all these five will
<div n="lb"/>be born in the lunar race and will marry you.”
<div n="NI"/>The Indras agreed to be born on earth and do the
<div n="lb"/>work of God. After that they all went to Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to give them mighty accomplices to
<div n="lb"/>fulfil their mission. Then Mahāviṣṇu plucked two hairs
<div n="lb"/>from his body, one white and the other black, and
<div n="lb"/>dropped them on the ground. The black hair was
<div n="lb"/>born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the white hair was born as
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma, to help the Pāṇḍavas later.
<div n="NI"/>Pāñcālī's two previous births can be explained thus:
<div n="lb"/>Agnideva created Māyāsītā who in turn became Svarga-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī to be born as Pāñcālī. Māyāsītā was a part of
<div n="lb"/>Mahālakṣmī and so also Nālāyaṇī who became Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>was a part of Lakṣmī. Pāṇḍavas are known to be the
<div n="lb"/>sons of five gods and they used for the procreation of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas Indrāṃśa (part of Indra) thus making
<div n="lb"/>them all Indras. (Chapters 197 and 198, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Pāñcālī.%} Pāñcālī was born in the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Drupada, King of Pāñcāla. She had a brother named
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛṣṭadyumna. There is a story about their birth in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas:
<div n="NI"/>Drupada insulted Droṇa his classmate in the Gurukula
<div n="lb"/>and Droṇa kept in mind the insult to wreak vengeance
<div n="lb"/>on Drupada. Drupada, therefore, wanted a son to be
<div n="lb"/>born who would defeat Droṇa in a battle. Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>advised him to conduct a Yāga for that purpose. He
<div n="lb"/>decided to conduct one on a large scale and went about
<div n="lb"/>in search of a Yajvā (one who performs sacrifices
<div n="lb"/>according to Vedic rites) and reached Kalmāṣapurī on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the river Gaṅgā. There he saw a brahmin's
<div n="lb"/>house where lived two sages named Yāja and Upayāja.
<div n="lb"/>They were in figure and nature alike. At first Drupada
<div n="lb"/>went to the younger of the two, Upayāja. He went near
[Page550-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>him and after massaging his feet and legs requested him
<div n="lb"/>to officiate in a Yāga aimed at getting for him a son
<div n="lb"/>to conquer Droṇa in a battle. He promised to give
<div n="lb"/>him ten crores of cattle for that and also anything else
<div n="lb"/>the sage wanted. These promises did not make the sage
<div n="lb"/>consent to conduct the Yāga and so the King stayed
<div n="lb"/>at the āśrama serving the sage. A year went by and
<div n="lb"/>one day the sage appeared cheerful and told Drupada
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Oh King, my brother who was walking one day
<div n="lb"/>in a storm saw a fruit lying on his way and ate it with-
<div n="lb"/>out first ascertaining whether the fruit was pure or not.
<div n="lb"/>Again, I have seen him taking food from others freely
<div n="lb"/>and eating it. I think he is wishful about wealth and,
<div n="lb"/>perhaps, if you approach him he may help you.”
<div n="NI"/>Drupada went to Yāja and after serving him to please
<div n="lb"/>him made his request promising him much wealth. Yāja
<div n="lb"/>was ready to perform the Yajña. Upayāja came to them
<div n="lb"/>at that time and Yāja consulted his brother before going
<div n="lb"/>to perform the Yajña. The Yāga was successfully
<div n="lb"/>conducted and at the end the priest Yāja called the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Drupada and gave her havya (clarified butter).
<div n="lb"/>Because the havya was prepared by Yāja and was offered
<div n="lb"/>by Upayāja the sages said that the queen would get two
<div n="lb"/>children. While Yāja was offering oblations to the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fire a boy with a crown on his head and
<div n="lb"/>bearing a sword and a bow in his hands rose from the
<div n="lb"/>fire. The ṛṣis present there then said that, that boy would
<div n="lb"/>kill Droṇa. He was named Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Then from
<div n="lb"/>the dais of the Yāga-fire emerged a beautiful lady of
<div n="lb"/>dazzling brilliance. Immediately a voice from heaven
<div n="lb"/>was heard to say thus: “This Sumadhyamā (a girl in
<div n="lb"/>her blossoming youth) would work on the side of God
<div n="lb"/>and will cause terror to the Kauravas.”
<div n="NI"/>Yāja blessed the wife of Drupada saying that the
<div n="lb"/>two children would thenceforth call her mother.
<div n="lb"/>Yāja himself named the boy Dhṛṣṭadyumna and the
<div n="lb"/>girl according to the ethereal voice, Kṛṣṇā. Kṛṣṇā was
<div n="lb"/>dark in complexion. Kṛṣṇā was called Pārṣaṭī because she
<div n="lb"/>was the grand-daughter of Pṛṣata and Draupadī because
<div n="lb"/>she was the daughter of Drupada and Pāñcālī because
<div n="lb"/>she was the daughter of the King of Pāñcāla. Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>grew up in the palace of Drupada. (Chapter 167, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} After escaping from the lac palace the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas reached a village named Ekacakrā after
<div n="lb"/>walking a long time through the forests. There they
<div n="lb"/>stayed in a brahmin's house. Every morning they
<div n="lb"/>would go in disguise for begging and return with the
<div n="lb"/>alms in the evening. This was their daily routine and
<div n="lb"/>one day while they were in their daily round they saw
<div n="lb"/>a group of brahmins and they said they were going to
<div n="lb"/>the Svayaṃvara of the daughter of the King of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla. The brahmins invited them also to come
<div n="lb"/>along with them describing in detail the beauty of the
<div n="lb"/>girl and the elaborate and festive arrangements made
<div n="lb"/>for the marriage. The Pāṇḍavas went to Pāñcāla along
<div n="lb"/>with the brahmins. On the way they met Vedavyāsa
<div n="lb"/>and receiving blessings from him they went to the
<div n="lb"/>capital city of Pāñcāla and took their abode in the
<div n="lb"/>house of a potter. Nobody knew who they were.
<div n="NI"/>Drupada had placed a mighty steel bow in the
<div n="lb"/>marriage hall. When all the distinguished guests were
<div n="lb"/>seated in the marriage hall, the King announced that
<div n="lb"/>his daughter would be given in marriage to him who
<div n="lb"/>bent the steel bow and with it shot a steel arrow,
[Page550-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>through the central aperture of a revolving disc, at a
<div n="lb"/>target placed above. Many valiant princes from all
<div n="lb"/>parts of Bhārata including the Kauravas had gathered
<div n="lb"/>there. When it was time for the ceremonies to begin
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī clad in beautiful robes with a bewitching
<div n="lb"/>charm which excited the royal assemblage entered the
<div n="lb"/>hall with a garland in her hands. Then Dhṛṣṭadyumna
<div n="lb"/>brother of Pāñcālī said “Hear ye, oh princes, seated in
<div n="lb"/>state in this assembly, here is the bow and arrow. He
<div n="lb"/>who sends five arrows in succession through the hole
<div n="lb"/>in the wheel and unerringly hits the target shall win
<div n="lb"/>my sister.”
<div n="NI"/>Many noted princes rose one after another and tried
<div n="lb"/>in vain to string the bow. It was too heavy and
<div n="lb"/>stiff for them. Then Arjuna rose and meditating on
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme God, strung the bow with
<div n="lb"/>ease and hit at the target. Pāñcālī then put the gar-
<div n="lb"/>land on Arjuna's neck and accepting him as her
<div n="lb"/>husband went with him and stayed that night at the
<div n="lb"/>house of the potter. Drupada that night went to the
<div n="lb"/>house of the potter to make enquiries about his daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter and son-in-law. His joy knew no bounds when he
<div n="lb"/>knew that his son-in-law was none other than the
<div n="lb"/>celebrated Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas then took Pañcālī
<div n="lb"/>to their home in Ekacakrā and as soon as Kuntīdevī
<div n="lb"/>heard the footsteps of her sons outside she said from
<div n="lb"/>inside asking them to share that day's alms among
<div n="lb"/>themselves little knowing that it was a bride that
<div n="lb"/>had been brought by them. Thus Pāñcālī became the
<div n="lb"/>common consort of the five Pāṇḍavas. Then the
<div n="lb"/>marriage of Pāñcālī was ceremoniously conducted
<div n="lb"/>after inviting friends and relatives. The Pāṇḍavas then
<div n="lb"/>built a new palace at Indraprastha and lived there.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 190 to 220, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa was present there along with the leading
<div n="lb"/>members of the clan of Vṛṣṇi. He could recognise
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas in spite of their disguise. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to the potter's house and visited them. He gave
<div n="lb"/>them valuable presents on the occasion of their
<div n="lb"/>marriage.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Making Draupadī naked.%} Once Duryodhana challeng-
<div n="lb"/>ed Dharmaputra to a game of dice. Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>lost all and in the end in despair pledged Draupadī
<div n="lb"/>and lost her. Immediately Duryodhana asked Vidura
<div n="lb"/>to bring Draupadī to his palace and make her serve as
<div n="lb"/>a servant-maid. Vidura did not consent to that. Then
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana asked Prātikāmi to bring her. While
<div n="lb"/>entering the palace of Draupadī, Prātikāmi was as
<div n="lb"/>timid as a dog about to enter the cage of a lion. He
<div n="lb"/>informed Draupadī of his mission. Draupadī sent him
<div n="lb"/>back and then Duryodhana sent another messenger.
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī went with him to the court of the Kauravas.
<div n="lb"/>As soon as Duśśāsana saw Draupadī he jumped at her
<div n="lb"/>and caught hold of her hair and dragged her to the
<div n="lb"/>centre of the assembly. When Duśśāsana dragged her
<div n="lb"/>thus she said in piteous tones “I am in my monthly
<div n="lb"/>period and I have only the upper garment on me.
<div n="lb"/>Please do not take me to the assembly.” Duśśāsana
<div n="lb"/>was not moved by these pleadings and he dragged her
<div n="lb"/>still.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīma could not hold himself calm against this atrocity
<div n="lb"/>any longer and in a roar of wrath he abused Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra for pledging Pāñcālī thus and losing her.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna however remonstrated gently with Bhīma.
<div n="lb"/>Then to the consternation of all, Duśśāsana started his
[Page551-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>shameful work of pulling at Pāñcālī's robes to strip
<div n="lb"/>her of all the clothes. All earthly aid having failed
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī in utter helplessness implored divine mercy
<div n="lb"/>and succour. Then a miracle occurred. In vain did
<div n="lb"/>Duśśāsana toil to pull the garments completely and
<div n="lb"/>make her naked. As he pulled off each, fresh garments
<div n="lb"/>were seen to come from somewhere and cover her
<div n="lb"/>nudity. Duśśāsana retired from his work exhausted and
<div n="lb"/>disappointed. Then Karṇa ordered that Draupadī
<div n="lb"/>should be sent to the palace of Duryodhana as a
<div n="lb"/>servant-maid. Hearing this Duśśāsana once again
<div n="lb"/>started dragging her. Draupadī wept. Bhīma roared
<div n="lb"/>in fury and said that if his brother, Dharmaputra,
<div n="lb"/>gave him permission he would at that instant smash to
<div n="lb"/>death the Kauravas just like a lion killing the animals.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma and Droṇa interfered and pacified him.
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana stood up and striking his right thigh with
<div n="lb"/>his right hand challenged Bhīma to a fight. Bhīma-
<div n="lb"/>sena did not like Duryodhana exhibiting his naked
<div n="lb"/>thigh in front of Draupadī and an angered Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>declared that he would in a battle break Duryodhana's
<div n="lb"/>thigh with his mace. Dhṛtarāṣṭra came to the
<div n="lb"/>scene and pacified both of them and turning to
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī asked her to name any boon she wanted from
<div n="lb"/>him. Pāñcālī said: “In order that my son, Prativin-
<div n="lb"/>dhya, should not be called a ‘dāsaputra’ (son of a
<div n="lb"/>servant) his father Dharmaputra should be released
<div n="lb"/>from his servitude.” The boon was granted. Then she
<div n="lb"/>requested that all the other Pāṇḍavas should be set
<div n="lb"/>free. That was also allowed. Dhṛtarāṣṭra then asked
<div n="lb"/>her to name a third boon. Pāñcālī then said that all
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya women were entitled only to two boons and
<div n="lb"/>so there was no need for a third one. Then Draupadī
<div n="lb"/>took a vow that her hair which was let lose by the
<div n="lb"/>wicked Duśśāsana would be tied properly only by a
<div n="lb"/>hand tainted by the blood of Duśśāsana. After that in
<div n="lb"/>strict obedience to the conditions of the wager the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas started for the forests with Draupadī to
<div n="lb"/>spend twelve years in the forests and one year
<div n="lb"/>incognito. (Ten Chapters from Chapter 68, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vanavāsa of Pāñcālī.%} (Life in the forests). During
<div n="lb"/>the exile of the Pāṇḍavas in the forests Pāñcālī was
<div n="lb"/>involved in many events of which a few important
<div n="lb"/>ones are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Kirmīra's attack.%} When the Pāṇḍavas were in the
<div n="lb"/>Kāmyakavana, Kirmīra, the brother of Baka, came to
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama where Pāñcālī was taking rest. The demon
<div n="lb"/>was such a fierce-looking giant that Pāñcālī was forced
<div n="lb"/>to shut her eyes by fright and she became wearied like
<div n="lb"/>a river in the midst of five hillocks. Bhīmasena imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately ran to her rescue and killed Kirmīra. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>11, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Pāñcālī consoled Dharmaputra by her soothing
<div n="lb"/>words. (Chapter 27, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once when her woes became unbearable she
<div n="lb"/>condemned the devas. (Chapter 3, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) While the Pāṇḍavas were on the mountain
<div n="lb"/>Gandhamādana, Pāñcālī persuaded Bhīma to bring for
<div n="lb"/>her the Saugandhika flower. (See under Bhīma).
<div n="NI"/>(v) While the Pāṇḍavas were living in the Badarik-
<div n="lb"/>āśrama waiting for the return of Arjuna who had gone
<div n="lb"/>on a year's pilgrimage, Pāñcālī was carried away by
<div n="lb"/>Jaṭāsura. (See under Jaṭāsura).
[Page551-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(vi) After she was rescued from Jaṭāsura, Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>along with her husbands dwelt in the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa. (See under Ārṣṭiṣeṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Once Draupadī gave instructions on the duties
<div n="lb"/>of a wife to Satyabhāmā who came to the forests
<div n="lb"/>along with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (Chapters 233 and 234, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Once Durvāsas with his disciples came to the
<div n="lb"/>forest as the guests of the Pāṇḍavas. They came late
<div n="lb"/>and Pāñcālī had taken her food already. The
<div n="lb"/>Akṣayapātra (the never-empty pot) could not be
<div n="lb"/>invoked to produce anything that day and Pāñcālī was
<div n="lb"/>greatly agitated and worried. She prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>for succour and Śrī Kṛṣṇa also coming hungry searched
<div n="lb"/>in the pot for something to eat and finding a bit of
<div n="lb"/>spinach sticking to the sides of the pot grabbed it
<div n="lb"/>with avidity and ate it. The guests felt as if they had
<div n="lb"/>enjoyed a sumptuous feast and left the place well
<div n="lb"/>pleased. (See para XII under Duryodhana).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Jayadratha carried away Pāñcālī from the
<div n="lb"/>forests once. The Pāṇḍavas rescued her. (Para 4 under
<div n="lb"/>Jayadratha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Life incognito.%} After their twelve years of exile in
<div n="lb"/>the forests the time for living in disguise for a year
<div n="lb"/>came and Dharmaputra and his brothers with Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>spent that period in the palace of the King Virāṭa.
<div n="lb"/>Each assumed a new name and accepted different
<div n="lb"/>types of service under the King. Pāñcālī took the
<div n="lb"/>name of Sairandhrī and served as a companion and
<div n="lb"/>attendant to the princess. One day Kīcaka, the
<div n="lb"/>mighty brother-in-law of the King, tried to molest
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī and Bhīmasena killed him. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Kīcaka). It was at the time when the incognito life
<div n="lb"/>was coming to an end that the Kaurava army headed
<div n="lb"/>by Duryodhana carried away the cattle of the King
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa. The King was absent from the palace at that
<div n="lb"/>time and the prince, Uttara, had not the guts to go
<div n="lb"/>and attack the Kaurava army. It was Pāñcālī who
<div n="lb"/>then suggested sending of Bṛhannala of the palace
<div n="lb"/>(Arjuna) to serve as charioteer of Uttara. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, Para 24).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Subsequent events.%} The thirteen years of life in
<div n="lb"/>exile and incognito came to an end. But the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>were not prepared to give half of the kingdom to the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. The differences between them increased and
<div n="lb"/>it led to a great war. Śrī Kṛṣṇa agreed to go as a
<div n="lb"/>messenger to the court of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and ask for the
<div n="lb"/>share of the Pāṇḍavas. Before leaving he asked each of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas what he should say at the court of
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Pāñcālī then approached Kṛṣṇa in
<div n="lb"/>private and said she desired for a war to defeat the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas. She then reminded Kṛṣṇa of a vow taken
<div n="lb"/>by Bhīmasena that he would tie her hair with his
<div n="lb"/>hands smeared with the blood from the thigh of
<div n="lb"/>Duśśāsana.
<div n="NI"/>The peace-mission of Kṛṣṇa failed and the famous
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra battle started. Many valiant warriors on
<div n="lb"/>both the sides were killed. When Abhimanyu was
<div n="lb"/>killed Subhadrā wept bitterly and Pāñcālī who went
<div n="lb"/>to console her fainted. Śrī Kṛṣṇa revived her. Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>asked Bhīmasena to bring to her the inborn jewel on
<div n="lb"/>the head of Aśvatthāmā, son of Droṇa. She wanted to
<div n="lb"/>take revenge on him for killing her brother Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna.
[Page552-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>After a fierce battle for eighteen days the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>were defeated and their tribe annihilated. Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>took hold of Hastināpura and Pāñcālī was one among
<div n="lb"/>those who persuaded Dharmaputra to take charge of
<div n="lb"/>the administration of the state as its ruler. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra performed an Aśvamedhayajña and Pāñcālī gave
<div n="lb"/>presents to Citrāṅgadā and Ulūpī who were present
<div n="lb"/>for the function then. After the Aśvamedha Draupadī
<div n="lb"/>lived in Hastināpura serving Kuntī and Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>alike for a long time. It was at that time that
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī went to the forests
<div n="lb"/>and Draupadī expressed her desire to go along with
<div n="lb"/>them to be of help to them. But they did not allow
<div n="lb"/>her to do so. While the Pāṇḍavas were living in
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura as the rulers of the country eminent ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>from different parts of the country visited them and
<div n="lb"/>some of the Siddhas (realised souls) among them saw
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī as the goddess Mahālakṣmī herself. (Śloka 9,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 25, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Death of Pāñcālī.%} At the fag end of their life the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas crowned Parīkṣit as the King of Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>and started on their Mahāprasthāna. They travelled
<div n="lb"/>for long through the Himālayas and reached Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru. At that time Pāñcālī fell down dead. Then
<div n="lb"/>Bhīmasena asked Yudhiṣṭhira why without any parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular ailment Pāñcālī died. Yudhiṣṭhira replied that it
<div n="lb"/>was because she showed special interest in Arjuna The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas walked on and all of them excepting
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra died on the way one by one. Even
<div n="lb"/>before Dharmaputra entered svarga Pāñcālī and the
<div n="lb"/>four brothers had reached there. (Chapters 1 to 4,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāprasthānika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9). {%Sons of Pāñcālī.%} Pāñcālī had five sons one each
<div n="lb"/>from each of the five husbands. She got Prativindhya
<div n="lb"/>of Yudhiṣṭhira, Śrutasoma of Bhīmasena, Śrutakīrti of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, Śatānīka of Nakula and Śrutakarmā of
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva. (Śloka 73, Chapter 95, Ādi Parva).
