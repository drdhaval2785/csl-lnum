MĀLĪ¦. A demon of great valour.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} There were two very brave
<div n="lb"/>brothers in the demon tribe named Heti and Praheti.
<div n="lb"/>They were inseparable companions of Mahābali. Pra-
<div n="lb"/>heti was unmarried and spent his time in religious
<div n="lb"/>pursuits. Heti married Bhayā sister of Kāla and got a
<div n="lb"/>son named Vidyutkeśa. Vidyutkeśa married Sāla-
<div n="lb"/>kaṭaṅkā daughter of Sandhyā and got a son named
<div n="lb"/>Sukeśa Sukeśa married Devavatī, daughter of Grāmaṇī,
<div n="lb"/>alias Maṇimāyā. Devavatī delivered three sons, Mālī
<div n="lb"/>Sumālī and Mālyavān.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Boon to Mālī.%} The three brothers, even while young
<div n="lb"/>decided to acquire great strength and started performing
<div n="lb"/>penance. When their penance became very fierce
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appeared before them in person and asked them
<div n="lb"/>what boon they wanted. They said, ‘We must be invin-
<div n="lb"/>cible, we must be destroyers of our enemies, we must
<div n="lb"/>have long life, we must become rich and powerful
<div n="lb"/>ever remaining friendly with each other”. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>granted the boon asked for.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Family life.%} After obtaining the boon they went
<div n="lb"/>to Viśvakarmā and asked him to construct a place of
<div n="lb"/>abode for them. Viśvakarmā was frightened and he
<div n="lb"/>hastened to suggest a beautiful place for them to live.
<div n="lb"/>He said, “There is a mountain named Trikūṭa on the
<div n="lb"/>shores of the southern sea. There is a mountain on it
<div n="lb"/>called Subala. Its main top grazes the sky. Its four
<div n="lb"/>sides have been beautifully chiselled. No birds fly to its
<div n="lb"/>top. I have constructed there at the request of Indra
<div n="lb"/>a beautiful city surrounded by walls of gold and adorned
<div n="lb"/>on all sides with festoons of gold. That city is called
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā and you, demon-lords, can stay there. You will
<div n="lb"/>get glory and prestige which even Indra could not
<div n="lb"/>acquire in his Amarāvatī. If you live in Laṅkā with
<div n="lb"/>your followers you will be unconquerable”.
<div n="NI"/>The happy demons with their people went to Laṅkā.
<div n="lb"/>They married the daughters of a Gandharva woman
<div n="lb"/>named Narmadā. Mālī married Vasudhā; Sumālī,

<div n="lb"/>Ketumatī; and Mālyavān, Sundarī. Mālī begot of
<div n="lb"/>his wife Vasudhā four sons named Anila, Anala, Hara
<div n="lb"/>and Sampāti. Sumālī got of his wife Ketumatī ten sons
<div n="lb"/>named Prahasta, Akampana, Vikaṭa, Kālakāmukha,
<div n="lb"/>Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃhrāda, Prakvātā and
<div n="lb"/>Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters named Vekā, Puṣpot-
<div n="lb"/>kaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} The three brothers attacked Devaloka under
<div n="lb"/>the leadership of Mālī and a great fight ensued and
<div n="lb"/>Mālī died by the discus of Mahāviṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa).
