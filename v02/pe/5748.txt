ṚJRAŚVA¦. A muni (sage) celebrated in the Ṛgveda.
<div n="lb"/>Some details. (1) Ṛjrāśva was made blind by his father
<div n="lb"/>(Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka, 112th Sūkta)
<div n="lb"/>(2) Ṛjrāśva was the son of the royal sage, Vṛṣāgīr.
<div n="lb"/>Once the donkey which is the vehicle of the Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>assumed the shape of a she-wolf and went to Ṛjrāśva.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛjrāsva gave it 100 sheep belonging to the people of
<div n="lb"/>the country and cut them to pieces and offered the same
<div n="lb"/>as food to the she-wolf. This plunder of the people's
<div n="lb"/>wealth enraged Vṛṣāgīr. He cursed Ṛjrāśva and made
<div n="lb"/>him lose his eye-sight.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛjrāśva who thus became blind offered prayers to
<div n="lb"/>Agni, who restored his eyesight. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala,
<div n="lb"/>17th Anuvāka, 116th Sūkta).
