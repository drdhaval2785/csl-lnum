DADHYAṄ¦.
<F>1) The stories regarding the two hermits Dadhici and Dadhyaṅ in the Purāṇas are not very clear. In Mahā bhārata Dadhīca is men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned as the son of Bhṛgu, and in Ṛgveda it occurs that Dadhīca was the son of Hermit Atharva who was the son of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover the story of Dadhyaṅ teaching the Aśvinīdevas the ‘Madhuvidyā’ is connected with Dadhici in some other purānas
<div n="lb"/>Some statements in the Ṛgveda make it difficult to assume that both Dadhyaṅ and Dadhīci are one and the same person. So relying
<div n="lb"/>on the majority of statements in the various purāṇas this book has accepted the fact that these hermits are separate persons and that
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīci was the son of Bhṛgu whereas the hermit who taught Madhuvidyā to the Aśvinīdevas was Dadhyaṅ.</F> A hermit. Once Indra taught this
<div n="lb"/>hermit Madhuvidyā (the art of mead) Indra told the
<div n="lb"/>hermit that his head would be cut off if he taught any-
<div n="lb"/>body this art. The Aśvinīdevas approached Dadhyaṅ
<div n="lb"/>to learn this art. Fearing Indra the hermit refused to
<div n="lb"/>teach them the art. Aśvinīdevas cut off his head and
<div n="lb"/>buried it in a place. Then they cut off the head of a
<div n="lb"/>horse and fixed it on the neck of Dadhyaṅ. Having
<div n="lb"/>the head of the horse he taught the art to the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas. When Dadhyaṅ had finished teaching, they
<div n="lb"/>took away the head of the horse and fixed his own
<div n="lb"/>head in place. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka, 17,
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta 166).
