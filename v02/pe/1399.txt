CALĀ¦. Lakṣmīdevī. The following story is told in the
<div n="lb"/>Devī-bhāgavata as to how this name came to be
<div n="lb"/>applied to the devī. Once Revanta the very handsome
<div n="lb"/>son of Sūryadeva came to Vaikuṇṭha riding Uccaiḥ-
<div n="lb"/>śravas, Indra's horse. Devī, who was at that time with
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu gazed for a few minutes in wonder at the horse.
<div n="lb"/>She did not, therefore, attend to Viṣṇu's talk. Angered
<div n="lb"/>at this Viṣṇu told the devī: “Since your eyes find
<div n="lb"/>enjoyment on unnecessary things and move about
<div n="lb"/>among such objects, you shall be called from today
<div n="lb"/>onwards Ramā and Calā. Also you will be born as a
<div n="lb"/>mare on earth. Accordingly Mahālakṣmī was born as
<div n="lb"/>a mare on the banks of river Sarasvatī, and regained
<div n="lb"/>her old form only after delivering a son by Viṣṇu. That
<div n="lb"/>son was Ekavīra, founder of the Hehaya kingdom. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 6).
