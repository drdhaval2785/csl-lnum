ŚIŚUNĀGA¦. The first King of the Śiśunāga dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>He founded the dynasty after defeating Nandivardhana
<div n="lb"/>of Pradyota family, King of Magadha. Though he
<div n="lb"/>first belonged to Kāśī region, later on he settled down
<div n="lb"/>in Magadha. Kākavarṇa was Śiśunāga's son.
<div n="NI"/>The following ten Kings of Śiśunāga dynasty ruled the
<div n="lb"/>country for 360 years. (1) Kākavarṇa (2) Kṣema-
<div n="lb"/>dharmā (3) Kṣemajit (4) Vindhyasena (5) Bhūmi-
<div n="lb"/>mitra (6) Ajātaśatru (7) Vaṃśaka (8) Udāsī (9)
<div n="lb"/>Nandivardhana (10) Mahānandi. (Matsya Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>272, 6-17; Vāyu Purāṇa 99. 314-315).
<div n="NI"/>ŚIŚUPĀLA. King of Cedi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Previous birth.%} Jaya and Vijaya, gate-keepers at
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha were born thrice in asura womb as a result
<div n="lb"/>of the curse by munis like Sanaka. They were first
<div n="lb"/>born as Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, next as
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa and the third time as
<div n="lb"/>Śiśupāla and Dantavaktra. (See under Jayavijayas).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śiśupāla was the son of King Damaghoṣa
<div n="lb"/>of Cedi by his wife, Śrutaśravas (Bhāgavata, 9th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha). He was born with three eyes and four
<div n="lb"/>hands, and at the time of birth he brayed like an ass,
<div n="lb"/>so the parents decided to abandon the ugly and awkward
<div n="lb"/>child. Immediately a Jin (ghost) appeared and told
<div n="lb"/>the father that the child would grow up to become very
<div n="lb"/>strong and powerful, and that only one person would
<div n="lb"/>be able to kill him and that person had already been
<div n="lb"/>born on earth. Further questioned by Śiśupāla's
<div n="lb"/>mother, the Jin said that as soon as the son saw the
<div n="lb"/>person born to kill him, he would lose his third eye,
<div n="lb"/>and that if he was seated on the lap of the person, two
[Page720-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>out of his four hands would be lost. After having said
<div n="lb"/>this the Jin disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>News about this peculiar child spread far and wide
<div n="lb"/>and many kings visited him. Damaghoṣa placed the
<div n="lb"/>child on the lap of each of them. But, no physical
<div n="lb"/>change occurred to him. Then one day Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadra came to see the child, whose mother
<div n="lb"/>Śrutaśravas (she was also the sister of Kṛṣṇa's father)
<div n="lb"/>placed him on Kṛṣṇa's lap. immediately two hands and
<div n="lb"/>the third eye of the child vanished, and with tears in
<div n="lb"/>her eyes the mother prayed Kṛṣṇa never to kill
<div n="lb"/>Śiśupāla, and Kṛṣṇa promised that he would forgive
<div n="lb"/>the crimes of Śiśupāla a hundred times. (Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 43).
