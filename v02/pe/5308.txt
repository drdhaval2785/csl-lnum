PRAMĪLĀ¦. Chief of the Strīrājya (country of women)
<div n="lb"/>in the Himālayas. The Pāṇḍavas conducted an aśvame-
<div n="lb"/>dhayāga after the great battle. It was Arjuna who follow-
<div n="lb"/>ed the sacrificial horse. Roaming about without any-
<div n="lb"/>body daring to tie it the horse reached Strīrājya and
<div n="lb"/>Pramīlā tied the horse. Arjuna challenged her and in
<div n="lb"/>the fight that ensued Pramīlā defeated Arjuna. At that
<div n="lb"/>time there was a voice from heaven which said “Arjuna,
<div n="lb"/>you will never be able to take back the horse after de-
<div n="lb"/>feating Pramīlā. So if you want to save the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>horse, enter into a truce with her and make her your
<div n="lb"/>wife.” Arjuna took the advice and saved the horse
<div n="lb"/>after marrying Pramīlā. (Jaiminīya, Aśvamedha Parva,
<div n="lb"/>21—22).
