PRĀYAŚCITTA¦. In ancient Bhārata sacred injunctions
<div n="lb"/>existed about religious rites to be performed for the
<div n="lb"/>atonement of sins committed. The following are a few
<div n="lb"/>of them.
<div n="NI"/>Murder is that act which ends in loss of life. One who
<div n="lb"/>kills a brahmin is a Brahmaghātaka. Even if murder is
<div n="lb"/>actually committed by one man, all those involved in
<div n="lb"/>a conspiracy for murder are murderers. If death occurs
<div n="lb"/>while treating a patient it is no murder. If death
<div n="lb"/>occurs when you punish your son, disciple or wife it is
<div n="lb"/>no sin. If he who has killed a brahmin or a cow
<div n="lb"/>commits suicide he will be absolved from his sin. Or he
<div n="lb"/>should go about begging with a skull and the organ of
<div n="lb"/>generation of any animal. If he spends twelve years
<div n="lb"/>begging eating little and with repentance in his heart
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmaghātaka will be absolved of his sin and
<div n="lb"/>he will become pure. If the murder is done to serve a
<div n="lb"/>purpose of his he should live as a beggar for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years but if it is not done to gain any end of his, he
<div n="lb"/>need live only for six years as a beggar. If a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>attempts to murder another brahmin he should observe
<div n="lb"/>the above vow for three years. If the attempt is made
<div n="lb"/>by a Kṣatriya he should double the period; if by a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya or Śūdra, triple the period If a brahmin kills
<div n="lb"/>a Kṣatriya he need observe only three fourths of the
<div n="lb"/>prāyaścitta. If a brahmin kills a Vaiśya or Śūdra he
<div n="lb"/>need observe only an eighth part of the prāyaścitta. If he
<div n="lb"/>kills a woman he should observe the punishment fixed
<div n="lb"/>for killing a Śūdra.
<div n="NI"/>If a brahmin does ‘gohatyā’ (killing a cow) he should
<div n="lb"/>practise penance drinking Pañcagavya (five products of
<div n="lb"/>the cow taken collectively). He should sleep in a cow-
<div n="lb"/>shed and go about feeding the cow and should also give
<div n="lb"/>away cows as gift. If a gohatyā is committed by a per-
<div n="lb"/>son of any other caste, he need observe only three
<div n="lb"/>fourths of the prāyaścitta. Hitting the cows by fists,
<div n="lb"/>piercing their body with nails and cutting their horns
<div n="lb"/>are to be classified under gohatyā. If one kills a cat
[Page607-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>mongoose, frog dog, or a bird, one should drink milk
<div n="lb"/>for three days.
<div n="NI"/>Though wine, date-palm-juice sugar-cane-juice,
<div n="lb"/>black-palm-juice, tamarind-juice and toddy are intoxi-
<div n="lb"/>cants they are not classified under alcoholic liquors.
<div n="lb"/>Real liquor or surā is that made from rice flour.
<div n="lb"/>Drinking liquor is prohibited to Brahmins, Kṣatriyas
<div n="lb"/>and Vaiśyas. If any one of these castes drinks he should
<div n="lb"/>drink water after performing penance or live eating
<div n="lb"/>pippalī (long pepper) for a year or eat oil cake at night
<div n="lb"/>for a year. If one drinks water in a pot used for taking
<div n="lb"/>liquor one should observe the prāyaścitta for seven days.
<div n="lb"/>If he drinks water from a cāṇḍāla he should observe the
<div n="lb"/>prāyaścitta for six days. If one eats rice from a cāṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>one should observe Cāndrāyaṇa. (an expiatory penance
<div n="lb"/>of decreasing and then increasing food according to the
<div n="lb"/>waxing and waning of the moon). If one eats food in
<div n="lb"/>the house of a Śūdra during times of distress, one
<div n="lb"/>would be absolved of the sin by repentance alone.
<div n="lb"/>Taking another man's property and appropriating it to
<div n="lb"/>himself is called theft. He who steals gold should be
<div n="lb"/>struck on the head by a wooden pestle by the king and
<div n="lb"/>killed. Alternatively he should live for twelve years
<div n="lb"/>with matted hair, eating one time a day only such
<div n="lb"/>things as leaves, fruits and roots and lying on earth. He
<div n="lb"/>who steals diamonds, pearls, corals, copper, silver, iron,
<div n="lb"/>bronze and granite stones should fast for twelve years.
<div n="lb"/>He who enjoys sexual intercourse with his father's wife,
<div n="lb"/>own sister, daughter of his preceptor or wife of the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor should burn himself in a hot iron pot. Alter-
<div n="lb"/>natively he should embrace a red hot iron idol of a
<div n="lb"/>woman and die. (Chapters 183 and 184, Agni Purāṇa).
