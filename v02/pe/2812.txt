JĀGRAT¦. According to the vision of Ṛṣis or sages, every
<div n="lb"/>living being has four states. They are Jāgrat (waking
<div n="lb"/>state), Svapna (dream), Suṣupti (profound sleep) and
<div n="lb"/>Turīya (the fourth state of the soul, i.e. oneness with
<div n="lb"/>Brahman in different degrees). The hermits and sages
<div n="lb"/>have said about the four states of soul as given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Jāgrat.%} In this state the individual soul is awake.
<div n="lb"/>The five organs of senses, the five organs of activity and
<div n="lb"/>the four inner organs of the living being will be active,
<div n="lb"/>when the soul is awake. In this state he enjoys the outer
<div n="lb"/>world through the five senses. That is, he sees with the
<div n="lb"/>eyes, hears with the ears, tastes with tongue, smells with
<div n="lb"/>the nose and feels with the skin. Every man thinks that
<div n="lb"/>his understanding through the senses is real. It is the
<div n="lb"/>individual soul which is responsible for this understand-
<div n="lb"/>ing. But it is difficult to say whether these perceptions
<div n="lb"/>through the senses are real or unreal. A hermit says as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—“An individual soul travels from Jāgrat to
<div n="lb"/>Svapna and from Svapna to Jāgrat as a fish which goes
<div n="lb"/>from one shore to the other without touching anything.
<div n="lb"/>For an individual soul the state of jāgrat is only one of
<div n="lb"/>the four states. So we cannot give the verdict that
<div n="lb"/>the state of Jāgrat alone is real and all the rest are
<div n="lb"/>unreal.” The individual soul which is in the state of
<div n="lb"/>Jāgrat enjoys the outer world and so it is ‘bahiḥ-
<div n="lb"/>prajña’ (external—knowing). In this state the indi-
<div n="lb"/>vidual soul enjoys the external world with the seven
<div n="lb"/>organs and the nineteen faces. The seven organs are,
<div n="lb"/>the two eyes, head, soul, body, urinal bladder and the
<div n="lb"/>legs. The nineteen faces are the five senses, the five
<div n="lb"/>organs of activity, the five life-breaths and the four
<div n="lb"/>inner organs of mind, intellect, egoism and will. The
<div n="lb"/>individual soul in the state of Jāgrat enjoys the external
<div n="lb"/>world with these organs and faces. The soul in this state
<div n="lb"/>is called ‘Vaiśvānara’. This state is experienced by all
<div n="lb"/>the human beings of the world and so it is called Vaiś-
<div n="lb"/>vānaras

<div n="lb"/>Pūrvaṃ cāparaṃ caivaṃ evāyaṃ puruṣaḥ etāvubhāvantau
<div n="lb"/>anusaṃcarati svapnāntaṃ buddhāntaṃ ca. (Bṛhadāraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>ka).

<div n="lb"/>mukhaḥ sthūlabhukvaiśvānaraḥ. (Māṇḍūkyopaniṣad)</F> (Bṛhadāraṇyaka, Māṇḍūkyopaniṣad).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Svapna (dream).%} The second state of the individual
<div n="lb"/>soul, is svapna (dream). He who indulges in dream,
<div n="lb"/>forgets everything he had experienced in the state of
<div n="lb"/>Jāgrat and creating new worlds he enjoys them. While
<div n="lb"/>the five organs of senses and the five organs of activity
<div n="lb"/>of the dreamer take rest, the four inner organs of
<div n="lb"/>citta (will) Ahaṅkāra (egoism) Buddhi (reason) and
<div n="lb"/>manas (Mind) will be working. See what the author of
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad says. “The dreamer separates his self from the
<div n="lb"/>wide universe and creates his own radiance by his own
<div n="lb"/>radiance. The light of the self is the light for the
<div n="lb"/>dreamer. That man creates a chariot or an assemblage
<div n="lb"/>of chariots or roads where there is no chariot or an
<div n="lb"/>assemblage of chariots or a road; joy, delight or ex-
<div n="lb"/>treme delight where there is no joy or delight or ex-
[Page336-b+ 75]
<div n="lb"/>treme delight; ponds, wells and rivers where there are
<div n="lb"/>no ponds, wells and rivers. A dreamer is a Lord; the
<div n="lb"/>state of the dream is the state of activity.” Another
<div n="lb"/>hermit says as follows about the state of dream:—
<div n="lb"/>“The dreaming individual soul which sees again things
<div n="lb"/>which were seen here and there, hears again things
<div n="lb"/>which were heard here and there, enjoys again things
<div n="lb"/>which were enjoyed in places far and near, is really
<div n="lb"/>enjoying greatness. He sees things seen and not seen,
<div n="lb"/>heard and not heard enjoyed and not enjoyed. The
<div n="lb"/>dreamer, like a King who travels with his train through-
<div n="lb"/>out his country, as he pleases, plays by getting in and
<div n="lb"/>out of his own body, and enjoys lofty experiences, and
<div n="lb"/>so he is happier than he who eats alone and enjoys his
<div n="lb"/>food. The individual soul in its state of dream is called
<div n="lb"/>the Taijasa (the radiant) because he illuminates
<div n="lb"/>himself by his own radiance. In this state the individual
<div n="lb"/>soul does not touch anything and so it is sinless.

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Suṣupti.%} The third state of the individual soul is
<div n="lb"/>suṣupti (profound sleep). The soul alone is active in
<div n="lb"/>this state. In suṣupti the individual soul desires for
<div n="lb"/>nothing and does not indulge in dream. In this state
<div n="lb"/>the individual soul does not think that the soul and the
<div n="lb"/>body are two. So it is unitary. The sleeper is called
<div n="lb"/>‘Prājña’ also. The individual soul which is in the state
<div n="lb"/>of sleep, completely severs its connection with the
<div n="lb"/>organs of senses, the organs of action, mind, the
<div n="lb"/>Prāṇamayakośa (the chest of the life-breaths), the
<div n="lb"/>manomaya kośa (the cask of mind) and Vijñānamaya
<div n="lb"/>Kośa, the chest of knowledge or understanding. The mind,
<div n="lb"/>the sense organs, Sūkṣmaśarīra (the subtle body) and
<div n="lb"/>the actions are the items which could abandon the
<div n="lb"/>connection with jīvātmā (individual soul). In sleep
<div n="lb"/>the jīvātmā separating all its connections, for the time
<div n="lb"/>being, with these items absorbs itself in the Brahman.
<div n="lb"/>See what the author of the Upaniṣad says about the
<div n="lb"/>state of Suṣupti (Sleep).
<F>3 (a) Yatra svapno na kaṃcana kāmaṃ kāmayate na kañcana
<div n="lb"/>svapnaṃ paśyati tat suṣuptaṃ suṣuptasthāne ekībhūtaḥ
<div n="lb"/>prajñānaghanam eva ānaṇdamayaṃ hi ānandabhukceto-
<div n="lb"/>mukhaḥ prājñaḥ. (Māṇḍūkya, Tritīya pāda).
<div n="lb"/>(b) Saptasthānontah prajñaḥ saptāṅgaḥ ekonaviṃśatimukhaḥ
<div n="lb"/>praviviktabhuk taijaso. (Dvitīyapāda Māṇḍūkya)</F>As an eagle folds its wings
<div n="lb"/>and falls down weary and tired, after flying round in
<div n="lb"/>the air for a long time, the individual soul, avoiding
<div n="lb"/>all desires and having no dreams, takes rest. The soul
<div n="lb"/>sleeps in the nāḍī, with seventy-two thousand branches
<div n="lb"/>called ‘hita’, like a child or a King or Brahman.
<div n="lb"/>During sleep the mind, senses etc. are not destroyed.
<div n="lb"/>They only keep away. They reappear when the man
<div n="lb"/>wakes up from sleep.
<F>4) Tadyathāsminnākāśe śyeno vā suparṇo vā viparipatya śrāntaḥ
<div n="lb"/>saṃhatya pakṣau saṃlayāyaiva dhriyata evam ayaṃ puruṣaḥ
<div n="lb"/>etasmā antāya dhāvati, yatra supto na kaṃcana kāmaṃ kāmayate no
<div n="lb"/>kaṃcana svapnaṃ pasyati.
<div n="lb"/>(Brhadāraṇkyaa)</F>
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Turīyam.%} In the state of Turīya the Jīvātmā alone
<div n="lb"/>is active. The individual souls which abide in creatures
<div n="lb"/>are another aspect of Brahman. Everything said about
<div n="lb"/>Brahman can be said about the jīvātmā in the state of
<div n="lb"/>profound sleep. But the bliss that we enjoy in sleep is
<div n="lb"/>not remembered in the state of activity. The same
<div n="lb"/>bliss that we enjoy in profound sleep could be enjoyed
[Page337-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in the state of samādhi (contemplation) of yoga or
<div n="lb"/>union with the universal soul. When it came to be
<div n="lb"/>known that this supernal bliss could be enjoyed even
<div n="lb"/>after one had awakened from contemplation, a fourth
<div n="lb"/>state of the jīvātmā (individual soul) was recognized.
<div n="lb"/>But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka only three states of the
<div n="lb"/>jīvātmā are mentioned.
<div n="NI"/>Immersion of the individual soul by the yogin in the
<div n="lb"/>universal soul Brahman in the state of jāgrat or
<div n="lb"/>activity is called Turīya. The individual soul which
<div n="lb"/>is in the state of Turīya, is described as follows in the
<div n="lb"/>Chāndogyopaniṣad.
<div n="NI"/>“The jīvātmā which is in the state of Turīya is not
<div n="lb"/>conscious internally. He whose inner consciousness is
<div n="lb"/>active is Taijasa. He is not bahiḥprajña (conscious of
<div n="lb"/>the outer world). Bahiḥprajña is Vaiśvānara. He is
<div n="lb"/>not a combination of Taijasa and Turīya. He is not
<div n="lb"/>compact with consciousness as a conscious man not a
<div n="lb"/>conscious man; nor is he an unconscious man. He, who
<div n="lb"/>could be explained only by negations, cannot be seen.
<div n="lb"/>He is unmanifestable, indiscernible, unthinkable,
<div n="lb"/>indescribable and without any characteristic mark.
<div n="lb"/>Only by unswerving faith could he be known. It
<div n="lb"/>creates the universes and at the same time negates īt.
<div n="lb"/>It is the supreme reality, the one without a second
<div n="lb"/>(dvaita). This is the state of Turīya.
<F>1) Nāntah prajñaṃ na bahiḥprajñaṃ nobhayataḥ prajñaṃ na prajñānaghanaṃ na prajñaṃ nāprajñam adṛṣṭam avyāhāryam

<div n="lb"/>sa vijñeyaḥ.</F>
<div n="NI"/>Vaiśvānara is called the soul with annamayakośa (the
<div n="lb"/>material body), Taijasa, the soul with Prāṇamayakośa
<div n="lb"/>(the sheath of the life breaths), Prājña, the soul with
<div n="lb"/>Vijñānamayakośa (the sheath of understanding) and
<div n="lb"/>Turīya, the soul with ānandamayakośa (the chest of
<div n="lb"/>bliss).
