AGNIPRAVEŚA¦(M). Entering fire. In the Yuddha-
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍā of the Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki has described Sītā's
<div n="lb"/>entering and standing in fire (Agnipraveśam) as a
<div n="lb"/>test of her purity. Though Rāma recovered Sītā from
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, he wanted to accept her as his wife only after
<div n="lb"/>her purity had been tested and proved. So he decided to
<div n="lb"/>test her by fire (Agniparīkṣaṇa). Sītā shed tears at the
<div n="lb"/>thought that her husband doubted her chastity.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa, at Rāma's bidding, made a pyre. Sītā
<div n="lb"/>jumped into it after praying to the gods. She remained
<div n="lb"/>unscorched by the fire and Rāma gladly received her
<div n="lb"/>once more as his wife.
