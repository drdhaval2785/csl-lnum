LOKA¦.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Origin of Loka.%} There are several views in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas regarding the origin of Loka or the world
<div n="lb"/>(Universe).
<div n="NI"/>(i) In the beginning of the universe Mahāviṣṇu alone
[Page455-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>stood as the Eternal, unseen, unheard, unknown entity.
<div n="lb"/>Then there was neither sky nor day nor night. When
<div n="lb"/>the time of creation came Prakṛti entered Viṣṇu as
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣa creating emotion. From emotion arose Mahat
<div n="lb"/>or the Great Principle and from Mahat arose cosmic
<div n="lb"/>egoism (Ahaṅkāra). Ahaṅkāra divided itself into
<div n="lb"/>Vaikārika, Taijasa and Tāmasa. From Ahaṅkāra arose
<div n="lb"/>Ākāśa with the quality of sound and from Ākāśa came
<div n="lb"/>the air having the quality of touch and from air came
<div n="lb"/>fire having the quality of colour and from fire came
<div n="lb"/>water having the quality of taste and from water came
<div n="lb"/>earth with the quality of smell. All these were born of
<div n="lb"/>tāmasic egoism. From taijasic egoism came into being the
<div n="lb"/>organs of sense. From the Vaikārika egoism came the
<div n="lb"/>ten Vaikārika devas and the eleventh organ of sense,
<div n="lb"/>the mind. After that Mahāviṣṇu discharged his virility
<div n="lb"/>into water and that virility is life. (Chapter 17, Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahaviṣṇu with a view to creating many different
<div n="lb"/>kinds of living things created water first and threw his
<div n="lb"/>whole energy into it. That energy grew into a golden
<div n="lb"/>mass of an egg and Brahmā was born from that egg.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu broke that egg into two, making one half
<div n="lb"/>heaven and the other earth. Between the two halves he
<div n="lb"/>created the sky. The earth was floating on the waters
<div n="lb"/>and he fixed it by anchoring it at ten sides. Then he
<div n="lb"/>created Prajāpati, Kāla, Manas, Vāk, Kāma, Krodha
<div n="lb"/>and Rati. Then he created thunder, lightning, clouds,
<div n="lb"/>rainbows and birds. Then for yajñasiddhi he created
<div n="lb"/>from his face Ṛgveda, Yajurveda and Sāmaveda. He
<div n="lb"/>did sacrifices with them. From his hands he created
<div n="lb"/>the different Bhūtagrāmas and Sanatkumāras. He
<div n="lb"/>created Rudra out of Krodha. From his mind were
<div n="lb"/>born Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu
<div n="lb"/>and Vasiṣṭha. He made these seven Brahmarṣis. These
<div n="lb"/>seven Brahmarṣis and Rudra began to create the prajās.
<div n="lb"/>Then Prajāpati divided his body into two. One half of
<div n="lb"/>it became man and the other woman. Brahmā started
<div n="lb"/>creation through that woman. (Chapter 18; Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In the beginning Mahāviṣṇu in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>child lay on a leaf of the Banyan tree. Lying there the
<div n="lb"/>Lord began to think like this, “Who am I? Who created
<div n="lb"/>me? Why was I created? What should I do here?”
<div n="lb"/>At once from the sky came a voice which said:—
<Poem>Sarvaṃ khalvidamevāhaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Nāṅyadasti sanātanam /</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(All these am I. There is nothing eternal except me).
<div n="lb"/>The Lord was surprised by the voice and there appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed before him Mahādevī with four hands bearing the
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkha, Cakra, Gadā and Padma one in each hand.
<div n="lb"/>She wore divine garments and ornaments and was accom-
<div n="lb"/>panied by Prosperity as her maid. She was surrounded
<div n="lb"/>by such forces as Rati Bhūti, Buddhi, Mati, Kīrti, Smṛti,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛti, Śraddhā, Medhā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Kṣudhā, Nidrā,
<div n="lb"/>Dayā, Gati, Tuṣṭi, Puṣṭi, Kṣamā, Lajjā, Jṛmbhā and
<div n="lb"/>Tandrī. Devī then addressed Mahāviṣṇu thus: “Why
<div n="lb"/>wonder? You have always come into being whenever
<div n="lb"/>creation was started by the greatness of great powers. The
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Being is without quality of any kind. We are all
<div n="lb"/>with quality. You have predominance of Sattvaguṇa.
<div n="lb"/>From your navel will arise Brahmā who will be dominat-
<div n="lb"/>ed by Rajoguṇa and from the centre of the forehead
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā will be born Rudra with Tamoguṇa
<div n="lb"/>predominant in him. Brahmā by the power of his pen-
[Page456-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ance will acquire the energy to create and he will then
<div n="lb"/>create the world. You will be the protector of this
<div n="lb"/>world which will in the end be destroyed by Rudra. I
<div n="lb"/>am the sāttvic power to help you in your work and I
<div n="lb"/>am always at your service.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Brahmā and Rudra were born and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>started his creation. (1st Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) In times of old during the great deluge everything
<div n="lb"/>in this universe became extinct. It went on like that
<div n="lb"/>for some time and then the five elements and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>were born. Brahmā was born in a lotus. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>decided there should be mud beneath the lotus. He
<div n="lb"/>went down through the stem of the lotus and travelled
<div n="lb"/>for a thousand years and yet did not find the earth. He
<div n="lb"/>came back and sitting inside the lotus started doing
<div n="lb"/>penance. After a thousand years Madhu-Kaiṭabhas
<div n="lb"/>rushed to attack Brahmā (See under Kaiṭabha).
<div n="NI"/>Fearing them Brahmā went under water again. As he
<div n="lb"/>went deep down he saw a great man sleeping there. It
<div n="lb"/>was Mahāviṣṇu and then only he knew he was sitting
<div n="lb"/>on the lotus originating from the navel of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu killed Madhu Kaiṭabhas and gave per-
<div n="lb"/>mission to start creation and Brahmā started his work
<div n="lb"/>of creation.
<div n="NI"/>(v) Before the origin of the Universe the shapeless
<div n="lb"/>qualityless Parāśakti permeated everything. From it
<div n="lb"/>there were born three powers: Jñānaśakti, Kriyāśakti
<div n="lb"/>and Arthaśakti. The power of Sattvaguṇa was Jñāna-
<div n="lb"/>śakti, the power of Rajoguṇa was Kriyāśakti and the
<div n="lb"/>power of Tamoguṇa was Arthaśakti. From the divine
<div n="lb"/>power of Tāmasa came the five basic things, sound,
<div n="lb"/>colour, touch, taste and smell. The quality of the sky
<div n="lb"/>was sound, the quality of air was touch, the quality of
<div n="lb"/>fire was colour, the quality of water was taste and the
<div n="lb"/>quality of earth was smell.
<div n="NI"/>Rajoguṇa was born of Kriyāśakti. The five organs of
<div n="lb"/>senses, ear, eye, nose, tongue and skin and the five
<div n="lb"/>organs of work, hand, leg, speech, organ of excretion
<div n="lb"/>and the organ of sex and the five breaths, Prāṇa, Apāna,
<div n="lb"/>Vyāna, Samāna and Udāna are the offsprings of Rājasa.
<div n="lb"/>These are the forms of Kriyāśakti. These are controlled
<div n="lb"/>by the favourable activity of Cicchakti. The five gods
<div n="lb"/>controlling the sense-organs like Vāyu, Sūrya, Pāśī
<div n="lb"/>and Aśvinīdevas and the four gods controlling intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gence, conscience etc. like Candra, Brahmā, Rudra,
<div n="lb"/>and Kṣetrajña and the mind are ten Tattvas (Princi-
<div n="lb"/>ples) born of sāttvika empowered with Jñānaśakti.
<div n="NI"/>All the Tattvas were made into five basic elements
<div n="lb"/>through the process of Pañcīkaraṇa and the Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>originated from it.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The constitution of Brahmāṇḍa.%} The Brahmāṇḍa is made
<div n="lb"/>up of seven Kośas (coverings). The one in the extreme
<div n="lb"/>interior is very small. The second Kośa originates from
<div n="lb"/>the centre of the first Kośa. The third Kośa also has
<div n="lb"/>its origin from the first one. Each of them envelops
<div n="lb"/>the one before it. The seventh Kośa thus originating
<div n="lb"/>from the first Kośa and bursting forth through the
<div n="lb"/>other six Kośas spreads out for millions of miles around.
<div n="lb"/>If you cut the Brahmāṇḍa longitudinally the one in
<div n="lb"/>the extreme interior is the earth. Then come Bhuvar-
<div n="lb"/>loka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, and
<div n="lb"/>Satyaloka in succession. The worlds in the lower half
<div n="lb"/>are called Pātāla, Rasātala, Mahātala, Talātala Sutala,
<div n="lb"/>Vitala and Atala. From Satyaloka to Atala there are
<div n="lb"/>fourteen lokas. The Brahmāṇḍa consists of the Sūrya,
[Page456-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Candra, Stars, Śukra, Budha, Aṅgāraka, Bṛhaspati,
<div n="lb"/>Śani, Saptarṣis, Dhruva, Śiṃśumāra and Rāhu, called
<div n="lb"/>the Jyotiścakra. Besides these there are twentyeight
<div n="lb"/>hells also. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃsa 1).
<div n="NI"/>Rāhu is ten thousand yojanas below Sūrya. Ten thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand yojanas below Rāhu is the loka of Siddhavidyā-
<div n="lb"/>dharas. Below that up to the path of the clouds is the
<div n="lb"/>loka of the demons, genū and manes. Hundred yojanas
<div n="lb"/>below this is the Bhūloka (earth). Ten thousand yojanas
<div n="lb"/>below the earth and as many yojanas below the world
<div n="lb"/>above each are Atala, Vitala Sutala, Talātala, Mahātala
<div n="lb"/>Rasātala and Pātāla. (5th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Origin of life.%} Brahmā originated from the navel
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu. Brahmā started creation after obtaining
<div n="lb"/>permission from Viṣṇu. In the beginning Brahmā created
<div n="lb"/>from the mind Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha,
<div n="lb"/>Kratu, and Pulastya. They are therefore called the
<div n="lb"/>Mānasaputras of Brahmā. (Manas = mind, Putra, =
<div n="lb"/>son). From his wrath came Rudra, from his lap came
<div n="lb"/>Nārada, from his right thumb Dakṣa, from his mind
<div n="lb"/>Sanaka and others and from his left thumb, Vīraṇī.
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa married Vīraṇī.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa got five thousand sons of Vīraṇī. They also got
<div n="lb"/>sons. When the population began to increase thus
<div n="lb"/>Nārada intervened and questioned the advisability of
<div n="lb"/>increasing the population before knowing the capacity of
<div n="lb"/>the earth. The sons of Dakṣa realised the sense in it
<div n="lb"/>and started to have a survey of the earth. Dakṣa was
<div n="lb"/>disappointed that the children left him without showing
<div n="lb"/>any interest in the work of creation. So he produced
<div n="lb"/>another five thousand sons and asked them to start the
<div n="lb"/>work of creation. But they were also sent away as
<div n="lb"/>before by Nārada. Dakṣa became angry and he created
<div n="lb"/>sixty daughters.
<div n="NI"/>He gave thirteen daughters to Kaśyapa, ten to Dharma,
<div n="lb"/>twentyseven to Candra, two to Bhṛgu, four to Ariṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>nemi, two to Kṛtāśva, and two to Aṅgiras. Of these
<div n="lb"/>most of the living things in the world were born to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa. (7th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa was the last of the Prajāpatis. Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>married the daughters of Dakṣa named Aditi, Diti,
<div n="lb"/>Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu, and Analā.
<div n="lb"/>Aditi got thirtythree sons and their family consists of the
<div n="lb"/>thirtythree crores of Devas. From Diti were born the
<div n="lb"/>daityas or asuras. From Danu was born the dānava
<div n="lb"/>Hayagrīva. Kālikā got two sons, Naraka and Kālaka.
<div n="lb"/>Tāmrā got five daughters, Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭrī and Śukī. Krauñcī gave birth to owls, Bhāsī
<div n="lb"/>to Bhāsas and Śyeni to Śyenas (Vultures, Kites etc.).
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭrī gave birth to Haṃsas, Kalahaṃsas and
<div n="lb"/>Kokas. Śukī gave birth to Natā and Nāta in turn to
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā. Krodhavaśā gave birth to ten daughters;
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgī, Mṛgamandā, Harī, Bhadramadā, Mātaṅgī,
<div n="lb"/>Śārdūlī, Śvetā, Surabhi, Surasā and Kadrū. Of these
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgī gave birth to beasts, Mrgamandā to trees and
<div n="lb"/>plants. Lions and monkeys are the children of Hari,
<div n="lb"/>Bhadramadā got a daughter named Irāvatī. Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Irāvatī. From Mātaṅgī were born the
<div n="lb"/>elephants and from Śārdūlī the tigers. The Aṣṭadigga-
<div n="lb"/>jas are the sons of Śvetā. Surabhi got two daughters
<div n="lb"/>named Rohiṇī and Gandharvī. Cows are the children
<div n="lb"/>of Rohiṇī and horses are the children of Gandharvī.
<div n="lb"/>Serpents are the sons of Surasā and Kadrū gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to snakes. From Manu were born men. Trees are the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Analā. Vinatā got two sons named Aruṇa and
[Page457-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa. To Aruṇa were born two sons, Jaṭāyu and
<div n="lb"/>Sampāti.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The end of the World%}—There are different views in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas regarding the end of the world. The differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent Purāṇas give different views. For knowing the
<div n="lb"/>views of Agni Purāṇa on the subject see under the
<div n="lb"/>heading ‘Pralaya’. The eleventh Skandha of Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>gives the following theory regarding the end of the
<div n="lb"/>world.
<div n="NI"/>All the material objects of the world will become
<div n="lb"/>illusory. Fire will increase. There will be no rains for
<div n="lb"/>hundred years together. The World will be burnt by
<div n="lb"/>the heat. The heat will go down to the head of Ananta
<div n="lb"/>who holds this world on his head. The Saptameghas
<div n="lb"/>(Seven Clouds) will rise up in the sunshine infested
<div n="lb"/>with the poisonous breath of Ananta. Then rains will
<div n="lb"/>start pouring down in streams as thick as the trunk of
<div n="lb"/>an elephant. Everything will be drowned in that water.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu alone will be left above the vast expanse of
<div n="lb"/>water. (See under Manvantara).
