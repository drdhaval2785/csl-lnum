VIKUṆḌALA¦. A Vaiśya who obtained heaven by
<div n="lb"/>bathing during the month Māgha in the waters of
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī. This Vaiśya was a deplorable sinner. Still the
<div n="lb"/>men of Kāla (Yama) sent Vikuṇḍala to heaven without
<div n="lb"/>minding his sins. This story occurs in Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 30, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>In days of old there lived a Vaiśya named Hema-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇḍala in the great kingdom of Niṣadha. He was a
<div n="lb"/>devotee and worshipper of devas and Brāhmaṇas. He
<div n="lb"/>carried on trade and agriculture and by plundering
<div n="lb"/>he amassed much wealth.
<div n="NI"/>Hemakuṇḍala grew old. He thought about the frailty
<div n="lb"/>of life and spent a sixth part of his wealth for charitable
<div n="lb"/>purposes. For remission of the sins committed through-
<div n="lb"/>out the whole of his life, he gave alms as stipulated
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas. After entrusting the family affairs to
<div n="lb"/>his sons Śrīkuṇḍala and Vikuṇḍala, he went to the
<div n="lb"/>forests for penance.
<div n="NI"/>His sons were young. They turned away from
<div n="lb"/>righteous ways and followed a path of pleasures and
<div n="lb"/>wickedness. They refused to pay any heed to the
<div n="lb"/>advice of their elders. Drinking and going to other
<div n="lb"/>women became their routine.
<div n="NI"/>Within a short time they lost their wealth. They had
<div n="lb"/>nothing to eat. Their friends and favourites all discard-
<div n="lb"/>ed them. Being forsaken by every body, they engaged
<div n="lb"/>themselves in theft or robbery. They were afraid of
<div n="lb"/>the king and the people, and so they shifted to the
<div n="lb"/>forest. They lived by hunting. At this time the elder
<div n="lb"/>brother was caught by a tiger. The younger brother
<div n="lb"/>was bitten by a snake. Thus, on the same day, both
<div n="lb"/>sinners met with death. The messengers of Yama took
<div n="lb"/>both of them to the world of Yama. According to the
<div n="lb"/>order of King Dharma, Vikuṇḍala got heaven and
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kuṇḍala got hell.
<div n="NI"/>Vikuṇḍala who was glad at obtaining heaven asked the
<div n="lb"/>men of Yama on the way, why he was given heaven.
<div n="lb"/>They replied, “There was a Brahmin who was well-
<div n="lb"/>versed in all branches of knowledge. He was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Harimitra. His hermitage was on the southern
<div n="lb"/>bank of Yamunā. Yourself and the Brahmin became
<div n="lb"/>friends in the forest. Because of that friendship you
<div n="lb"/>were enabled to take bath in two Māgha months in
<div n="lb"/>the holy waters of Kālindī which is capable of washing
<div n="lb"/>all the sins away. By the first Māgha bath you got
<div n="lb"/>remission of your sins. By the second Māgha-bath
<div n="lb"/>you became eligible for the attainment of heaven.”
