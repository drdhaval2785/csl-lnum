JĪRṆODDHĀRA¦. Erection and consecration of images
<div n="lb"/>fixed in temples which have fallen into dilapidation, is
<div n="lb"/>called Jīrṇoddhāra. Mention is made in Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 67, about the principles of Jīrṇoddhāra, as
<div n="lb"/>follows:
<div n="NI"/>The priest should adorn the image with ornaments and
<div n="lb"/>perform ‘Stavana’. If the idol is very badly ruined by
<div n="lb"/>age it must be abandoned. Broken image and that
<div n="lb"/>with any part of the body severed or disfigured should
<div n="lb"/>also be abandoned, even if it is made of stone or any
<div n="lb"/>other material. When the image is renovated the
<div n="lb"/>priest should make burnt offerings thousand times with
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃhamantra (spell or incantation). If the ruined
<div n="lb"/>image is made of wood it should be burned. If it is
<div n="lb"/>made of stone it should be placed at the bottom of
<div n="lb"/>deep water, either in the sea or anywhere else. If it is
<div n="lb"/>made of metals or jewels, it must be put into water.
<div n="lb"/>The ruined image should be placed in a carriage and
<div n="lb"/>covered with a cloth. With instrumental music and
<div n="lb"/>so forth the image should be taken to water in a pro-
<div n="lb"/>cession and then submerged in water. After this the
<div n="lb"/>priest must be given a gift. Only after this should the
<div n="lb"/>new image be erected and consecrated. On a good day
<div n="lb"/>in an auspicious moment a new image of the same
<div n="lb"/>material and measurement as of the old image should
<div n="lb"/>be erected and consecrated by the priest.
