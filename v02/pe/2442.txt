GIRIVRAJA¦. A city which has gained great importance
<div n="lb"/>in all the Purāṇas of India.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} There was once a King named Kuśa in the
<div n="lb"/>Pūru dynasty. (For genealogy see under ‘Gādhi’).
<div n="lb"/>This Kuśa begot of his wife, Vaidarbhī, four sons
<div n="lb"/>named Kuśāmba, Kuśanābha, Asūrtarajasa and Vasu.
<div n="lb"/>Each of them built a city of his own and started his
<div n="lb"/>rule there. Girivraja is the magnificent city built by
<div n="lb"/>Vasu. (Sarga 32, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jarāsandha's rule.%} Vasu had a son named Bṛhaḍratha
<div n="lb"/>and Jarāsandha was the son of Bṛhadratha. During the
<div n="lb"/>rule of Jarāsandha Girivraja became glorious like
<div n="lb"/>Nandanodyāna. This city lying in the midst of five
<div n="lb"/>mountains was the seat of prosperity then. (Chapter 21,
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva). Jarāsandha kept many mighty kings of
<div n="lb"/>his time, as prisoners in this city. Unable to control
<div n="lb"/>his wrath against Kṛṣṇa once he hurled his mace a
<div n="lb"/>hundred times and threw it from Girivraja to Mathurā.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Bhīmasena and Arjuna entered Girivraja in
[Page292-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>disguise and engaging Jarāsandha in a duel killed him
<div n="lb"/>and crowned his son as King. (Chapter 24, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva). Once King Duṃdhumāra abandoning the gifts
<div n="lb"/>offered by the devas came and slept in Girivraja.
