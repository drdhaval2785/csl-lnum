KUMBHAKARṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya—Viśravas—Kumbhakarṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Pulastya, one of the Prajāpatis married
<div n="lb"/>Havirbhū (Māninī) and a son called Viśravas was
<div n="lb"/>born to them.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa were born to Viśravas of
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpotkaṭā, and Vibhīṣaṇa was born to him of Rākā,
<div n="lb"/>and Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā were born to him of
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī. The above version is based on verses—1 to 8 in
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 275 of the Vana Parva. But, according to
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa and Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa were born to Viśravas of his wife called Kaikasī.
<div n="lb"/>According to the Agni Purāṇa, Puṣpotkaṭā and Kaikaśi
<div n="lb"/>were one and the same.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Former births of Kumbhakarṇa.%} Rāvaṇa and Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa were originally the two Devas called Jaya and
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya. Viṣṇu appointed them as gate-keepers at Vai-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇṭha. Once they stopped sages like Sanaka and others
<div n="lb"/>at the gates, and the latter cursed Jaya and Vijaya into
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas. When they complained about the curse to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu he promised to welcome them back to Vaikuṇṭha
<div n="lb"/>after they had lived three births as Rākṣasas. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Jaya was born as Hiraṇyākṣa and Vijaya as
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu, both of them Asuras. Mahāviṣṇu incar-
<div n="lb"/>nated himself as a Boar and killed Hiraṇyākṣa and
<div n="lb"/>as Narasiṃha he killed Hiraṇyakaśipu. Hiraṇyākṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu were reborn as Rāvaṇa and Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa respectively. Mahāviṣṇu, during his incarnation
<div n="lb"/>as Śrī Rāma killed both Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa was reborn as Śiśupāla and Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa as Dantavaktra. Both of them were killed by
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu during his incarnation as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus
<div n="lb"/>the Deva called Vijaya, on account of the curse of
<div n="lb"/>Sanaka and other sages, passed through three lives as
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu, Kumbhakarṇa and Dantavaktra and
<div n="lb"/>finally reached Vaikuṇṭha. (Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kumbhakarṇa secured boons.%} Kumbhakarṇa spent his
<div n="lb"/>childhood with his brothers at the āśrama of his father
<div n="lb"/>on mount Gandhamādana. Kubera was at the zenith of
<div n="lb"/>his glory at that time, having been crowned king of the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas, and also having got the Puṣpaka Vimāna. The
<div n="lb"/>reputation of Kubera kindled jealousy in Kumbhakarṇa
<div n="lb"/>and his brothers. They too performed penance in the
<div n="lb"/>forest on one foot for a thousand years. But, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>did not appear. They continued the penance without
<div n="lb"/>eating any food. Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā stayed there
<div n="lb"/>serving their brothers. Even after the second thousand
<div n="lb"/>years Brahmā did not appear. Then Rāvaṇa cut off his
<div n="lb"/>ten heads and made offerings of them to Brahmā. Then
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appeared. Brahmā restored his heads to Rāvaṇa
[Page440-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and he was granted the boon that he would not be
<div n="lb"/>killed by anybody but a man. The Devas shuddered
<div n="lb"/>at the gift to Rāvaṇa, and feared about the future in
<div n="lb"/>case Kumbhakarṇa too got such a boon. At their request
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī danced on his tongue at the time of
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa's request for a boon. Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa wanted NIRDEVATVAM (Absence of all
<div n="lb"/>Devas). But by a slip of the tongue (caused by Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatī) what he asked for was nidrāvatvam (sleep).
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā granted him nidrāvatvam; he said that Kum-
<div n="lb"/>bhakarṇa would sleep for six months of the year
<div n="lb"/>continuously. Vibhīṣaṇa got the boon that he should re-
<div n="lb"/>member righteousness in danger and use the Brahmāstra
<div n="lb"/>without any training in its use. The brothers returned
<div n="lb"/>home after securing the boons, and, after driving off
<div n="lb"/>Kubera, the lord of Laṅkā, Rāvaṇa and his brothers
<div n="lb"/>took their abode there. (Vana Parva, Chapter 275 and
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death of Kumbhakarṇa.%} Kumbhakarṇa played a very
<div n="lb"/>important part in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. Prominent
<div n="lb"/>warriors on the side of Rāma, like Sugrīva, his minis-
<div n="lb"/>ters and Lakṣmaṇa fought with him. But, none of them
<div n="lb"/>could kill him. At last, Śrī Rāma's arrows killed him.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>Kumbhakarṇa is not to be viewed merely and purely
<div n="lb"/>as an evil character. His advice to Rāvaṇa on various
<div n="lb"/>occasions shows noble traits of his character. When Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma with his army of monkeys appeared on the other
<div n="lb"/>side of the ocean Rāvaṇa held a conference of his
<div n="lb"/>brothers, ministers and others at which Kumbhakarṇa
<div n="lb"/>spoke as follows:—“You abducted Sītā without consult-
<div n="lb"/>ing us, and we would not therefore be responsible for
<div n="lb"/>the consequences of that action of yours. But, it is not
<div n="lb"/>proper that the younger brother should keep away
<div n="lb"/>when danger faces the elder one, and on that principle
<div n="lb"/>here I am ready to fight Rāma.”
<div n="NI"/>These weighty words of Kumbhakarṇa throw consi-
<div n="lb"/>derable light on the character of Kumbhakarṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddhakāṇḍa, Chapter 12).
