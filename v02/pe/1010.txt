BHAIRAVA II¦. A Pārṣada of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Immediately after his birth, this terrible
<div n="lb"/>monster subdued all the Devas without getting the
<div n="lb"/>permission of Śiva. Enraged at it, Śiva turned him into
<div n="lb"/>a tree by a curse. But Śiva was soon pacified and lifted
<div n="lb"/>the curse by declaring that those who offered pūjā to
<div n="lb"/>the gods would get the full reward for their worship
<div n="lb"/>only if they offered pūjā to Bhairava also.
<div n="NI"/>Bhairava became a tree as soon as he was cursed. He
<div n="lb"/>became a tree because he subdued the gods. Therefore
<div n="lb"/>that tree came to be called “DAMANAKA” tree
<div n="lb"/>(Damana = Subdue). It has another name. “TĀTIRI”
<div n="lb"/>tree. Even now, pious people offer pūjā to this tree.
<div n="lb"/>(Agni Purāṇa, Chapters 52-80).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Once Brahmā and Viṣṇu became swollen
<div n="lb"/>with pride. In his haughty way, Brahmā insulted Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Under the insult, Śiva was infuriated and out of the
<div n="lb"/>fire of his fury was born Bhairava with his black form.
<div n="lb"/>(Liṅga Purāṇa 1.90).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brahmahatyā.%} As soon as he was born, Bhairava
<div n="lb"/>rushed towards Brahmā and pinched off his fifth head
<div n="lb"/>which had insulted Śiva. By this, he incurred the sin
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmahatyā. For the expiation of this sin, as
<div n="lb"/>ordered by Śiva, Bhairava started on a journey to go
<div n="lb"/>abegging, with Brahmā's severed head in his hand.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva then created a woman named “Brahmahatyā”
<div n="lb"/>and asked her to follow Bhairava.
<div n="NI"/>Although Bhairava visited many holy places, he was
<div n="lb"/>not able to liberate himself from the sin of Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>hatyā. At last, at the suggestion of Śiva, he went to
<div n="lb"/>Vārāṇasī and washed off his sin. Brahmā's head which
<div n="lb"/>he carried, was also deposited there and the place be-
<div n="lb"/>came famous under the name of “Kapālamocana
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha”. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudra Saṃhitā).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family.%} In Kālikā Purāṇa there is an elaborate
<div n="lb"/>account of the family of Bhairava. According to this
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Vijaya, the reputed King of Vārāṇasī was born
<div n="lb"/>in the family of Bhairava. Kālikā Purāṇa also says
<div n="lb"/>that Vijaya destroyed the Khāṇḍavī city and set up
<div n="lb"/>the Khāṇḍava forest in its place.
<div n="NI"/>According to Kālikā Purāṇa, Bhairava and Vetāla
<div n="lb"/>were, in their previous births, two Śivapārṣadas named
<div n="lb"/>Mahākāla and Bhṛṅgi. It was by the curse of Pārvatī.
[Page115-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>that they were born as mortals in their next birth.
<div n="lb"/>(Kālikā Purāṇa 53).
<div n="NI"/>The Purāṇas mention eight Bhairavas called Asitāṃga,
<div n="lb"/>Ruru, Caṇḍa, Krodha, Unmatta, Kapāli, Bhīṣaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhāra.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Shape.%} Bhairava has a terrible shape. He wears the
<div n="lb"/>crescent moon and plaited hair on his head. His wea-
<div n="lb"/>pons are, sword, arrow, dagger, bow, trident, rope
<div n="lb"/>etc. At times he is dressed in elephant-skin. He has
<div n="lb"/>five faces. Serpents are his ornaments. (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 52-80).
