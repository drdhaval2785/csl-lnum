MUDRĀS¦. When he recites the mantras a Māntrika
<div n="lb"/>should use different kinds of gestures with his hands
<div n="lb"/>to suit the recital. They are called Mudrās. The
<div n="lb"/>Mudrās in general are given below:
<div n="NI"/>The first mudrā is called Añjalimudrā. Añjalī means a
<div n="lb"/>cavity formed by folding the hands and joining the
<div n="lb"/>open hands together. If the hands thus folded are placed
<div n="lb"/>on the breast it becomes a Vandinī mudrā. The hands
<div n="lb"/>should be placed on the breast with a slight slant to
<div n="lb"/>the left for Vandinī mudrā. The third mudrā is called
<div n="lb"/>Ūrddhva mudrā. Hold the left hand first in such a
<div n="lb"/>way that the thumb comes on the top and then with
<div n="lb"/>the fingers of the right hand bind the thumb of the
<div n="lb"/>left hand. The thumb of the right hand should also
<div n="lb"/>come to the top. This is called Ūrddhva mudrā. The
<div n="lb"/>lowering of the left palm opened up is called Varāha-
<div n="lb"/>mudrā. (Chapter 26, Agni Purāṇa).
