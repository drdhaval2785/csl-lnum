GUHA¦. King of the country of Niṣādas alias Śṛṅgi-
<div n="lb"/>verapura, on the banks of the river Gaṅgā. Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>when he went on exile to the forests went to the resi-
<div n="lb"/>dence of Guha accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā.
<div n="lb"/>Guha, a devotee of Rāma, received them with respect
<div n="lb"/>offering them many kinds of fruits and roots to eat.
<div n="lb"/>But Śrī Rāma said that it was not proper to accept
<div n="lb"/>fruits and roots and so he drank only pure water from
<div n="lb"/>him. But Guha was asked to feed his horse. At night
<div n="lb"/>when Lakṣmaṇa stood watch over Rāma and Sītā, Guha
<div n="lb"/>volunteered to stand guard but Lakṣmaṇa refused to
<div n="lb"/>accept the offer. So Guha kept company with Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and both of them spent the night talking to each other.
<div n="lb"/>In the morning as per Rāma's request Guha brought
<div n="lb"/>a canoe and Guha himself took Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and
[Page301-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Sītā to the other side of the river. (Sarga 50, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāṃāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Guha is seen next when Bharata comes to the forest in
<div n="lb"/>search of Rāma. When Bharata returned from Kekaya
<div n="lb"/>he went in search of Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa and came
<div n="lb"/>to Guha in Śṛṅgiverapura. Guha then gave Bharata all
<div n="lb"/>available information regarding Śrī Rāma. Guha then
<div n="lb"/>sent the Dāśa army along with Bharata. (Sarga 84,
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Guha, chief of Śṛṅgiverapura, spent the night with
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa under an Oka tree. (Chapter 6,
<div n="lb"/>Agni Purāṇa).
