BAKA I¦. A demon. The Pāṇḍavas escaping from the
<div n="lb"/>trap of Arakkilla (lac-house) through a secret tunnel
<div n="lb"/>went to the village Ekacakrā on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā and stayed there in the house of a brahmin.
<div n="lb"/>Baka was a demon who was terrorising the villagers
<div n="lb"/>there. He used to come to the village freely and carry
<div n="lb"/>away people for his food. Because of this nobody lived
<div n="lb"/>in peace and so they all joined together and decided
<div n="lb"/>to send one man daily with plenty of other eatables to
<div n="lb"/>the demon in this cave. Days went by like that and
<div n="lb"/>one day the turn came to the brahmin who was shelter-
<div n="lb"/>ing the Pāṇḍavas. That brahmin had besides his wife
<div n="lb"/>one son and a daughter. The problem arose as to who
<div n="lb"/>should go to the demon. The father was willing but
<div n="lb"/>the wife did not want him to go and vice versa. The
<div n="lb"/>children began to cry and hearing the noise Kuntī,
<div n="lb"/>mother of the Pāṇḍavas, went there to enquire and
<div n="lb"/>learned the tragic story of the family. She immediately
<div n="lb"/>went to Bhīma and acquainted him with the problem
<div n="lb"/>before the brahmin. Bhīma at once volunteered to go
<div n="lb"/>to the demon deciding to kill the man-eater and thus
<div n="lb"/>putting an end to his depredations.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīma started on his journey to the demon carrying a
<div n="lb"/>cartload of rice and curry. Deliberately Bhīma arrived
<div n="lb"/>at the place of the demon very late. Baka rolled his
<div n="lb"/>eyes in anger at the sight of the late-comer. But
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma without heeding him sat in front of the demon
<div n="lb"/>and started eating the rice and curry. Baka charged
<div n="lb"/>at Bhīma with fury but Bhīma defended and a battle
<div n="lb"/>ensued in which Baka was killed and he fell dead
<div n="lb"/>like a mountain-head dropping down.
<F>*) Kirmīra, a demon, was the brother of Baka. (Śloka 23, Chapter 11, Araṇya Parva, M.B.).
<div n="lb"/>{%f%} It is in the 10th Skandha of Bhāgavata that the story of this Baka occurs. But in the vernacular translation of the same the story is
<div n="lb"/>not so clear. Hence the original in Sanskrit is quoted below:
<Poem>Sa vai Bako nāma mahānasuro bakarūpadhṛk
<div n="lb"/>Āgatya sahasā Kṛṣṇam tīkṣṇatuṇḍo 'grasadbalī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇam mahābakagrastaṃ dṛṣṭvā Rāmādayo 'rbhakāḥ
<div n="lb"/>Babhūvurindriyāṇīva vinā prāṇaṃ vicetasaḥ.</Poem></F> (Chapters 157-
<div n="lb"/>164, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
