SṚÑJAYA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Somadatta.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%General information.%} A king of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>His father was Śviti. This king Śviti was also called
<div n="lb"/>Śvitya King. On the death of his father Sṛñjaya became
<div n="lb"/>king.
<div n="NI"/>The hermits Nārada and Parvata were friends of Sṛñ-
<div n="lb"/>jaya. Once both of them came and lived in the palace
<div n="lb"/>of the King as his guests. Sṛñjaya had a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Śucismitā. Both Nārada and Par-
<div n="lb"/>vata loved her. One day Nārada directly asked Sṛñ-
[Page738-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>jaya, for the hand of his daughter. Parvata got angry
<div n="lb"/>at this and cursed Nārada that he would not attain
<div n="lb"/>heaven. Nārada retorted with the same curse. Sṛñjaya
<div n="lb"/>pacified both.
<div n="NI"/>Sṛñjaya had no sons. He informed the hermits of this
<div n="lb"/>sad state. Nārada blessed the king and said that a son
<div n="lb"/>named Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī would be born to him and that
<div n="lb"/>with his birth everything in the palace would become
<div n="lb"/>gold. Accordingly the son Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī was born to
<div n="lb"/>Sṛñjaya and everything in the palace became golden.
<div n="lb"/>When the son became four years old, by the sorcery of
<div n="lb"/>Indra the child died. Nārada brought him to life again.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī).
<div n="NI"/>The fact that gold was accumulating in the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Sṛñjaya due to the boon given to Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī, reached
<div n="lb"/>the ears of robbers. One night they carried the child
<div n="lb"/>away, and killed him. Then only did they come to
<div n="lb"/>understand that there was no gold inside him. Sṛñjaya
<div n="lb"/>cried aloud at the loss of his son. To pacify the King,
<div n="lb"/>Nārada and Parvata told him stories of sixteen kings.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 55).

<div n="lb"/>Kings, his sorrow subsided. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chap-
