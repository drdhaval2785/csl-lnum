GADĀDHARA¦. A synonym of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>There is a place called Gayā to the north of Mount
<div n="lb"/>Kālañjara to the south of Himālayas, to the east of
<div n="lb"/>Kuśasthalī and to the west of Vasupura. Once a king
<div n="lb"/>called Gaya conducted at Gayā an Aśvamedha, a Nara-
<div n="lb"/>medha (yajña at which man is offered as sacrifice) and
<div n="lb"/>a Mahāmedha and Mahāviṣṇu acted as gate-keeper of
<div n="lb"/>Gaya. As Viṣṇu stood guard there holding the gadā
<div n="lb"/>(club) in his hands he came to be known as Gadādhara
<div n="lb"/>also thenceforth. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 76).
