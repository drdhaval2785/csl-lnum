PĀṆḌU I¦. Father of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Refer to the genealogy of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śantanu, a King of Candravaṃśa, had two
<div n="lb"/>wives, Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Even while Satyavatī was
<div n="lb"/>a maiden she got of the sage Parāśara a son named
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa. But because of the blessing of the sage Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī did not lose her maidenhood. She got of Śantanu
<div n="lb"/>two sons, Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya. Citrāṅgada
<div n="lb"/>died young. Vicitravīrya married the two daughters,
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā and Ambālikā, of the King of Kāśī. Vicitra-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya died before any progeny was born to him. To
<div n="lb"/>save the dynasty from extinction Satyavatī asked her
<div n="lb"/>first son Vyāsa to beget children of Ambikā and
<div n="lb"/>Ambālikā. Accordingly Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born to
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā of Vyāsa and Pāṇḍu to Ambālikā. (Chapters
<div n="lb"/>63 and 105, Ādi Parva)
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Pāṇḍu got his name.%} Vyāsa came to Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura by the command of his mother to beget sons of
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā and Ambālikā. Vyāsa was an ugly sage with
<div n="lb"/>matted hair and he was dressed in garments of
<div n="lb"/>deerskin. Satyavatī that night called Ambikā to her
<div n="lb"/>side and in secret commanded her to go and lie with
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa. She was reluctant to have a sexual union with
<div n="lb"/>that old and ugly sage. Yet obeying the orders of her
<div n="lb"/>mother-in-law she did so shutting her eyes during the
<div n="lb"/>whole period. The result was she got a child born
<div n="lb"/>blind who became known later as Dhṛtarāṣṭra. The
<div n="lb"/>next day Satyavatī ordered Ambālikā to go and lie
<div n="lb"/>with Vyāsa. Ambālikā on entering the bed chamber
<div n="lb"/>went pale on seeing the ugly Vyāsa and the result was
<div n="lb"/>she got a child that was pale white in colour. That
<div n="lb"/>child became known as Pāṇḍu. The third day Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī asked her servant-maid to go and lie with Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>She did it with pleasure and she remained happy and
<div n="lb"/>cheerful during the whole period. The result was she got
<div n="lb"/>a beautiful child who became an intelligent scholar of
<div n="lb"/>great wisdom. He was known later as Vidura. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ters 1, 63, and 105, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boyhood and kingship.%} Bhīṣma took care of Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura as his own sons. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>taught them all the Vedas including Dhanurveda, and
[Page564-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>all warfare like mace-fight. They were trained in the
<div n="lb"/>use of elephants also. Bhīṣma taught them law and
<div n="lb"/>acquainted them with all the Itihāsas and Purāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu became second to none in archery. The people
<div n="lb"/>were all happy. When the boyhood was over Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>was crowned as Yuvarāja. Pāṇḍu was the most eligible
<div n="lb"/>of the three to become King, for Dhṛtarāṣṭra was a
<div n="lb"/>born blind man and Vidura was the son of a servant-
<div n="lb"/>maid. (Chapter 109, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Married life.%} Obeying the behest of Bhīṣma, Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>married Pṛthā, daughter of the Yādava King Śūrasena.
<div n="lb"/>She was the sister of Vasudeva, father of Kṛṣṇa. She
<div n="lb"/>got the name Kuntī because she grew up in the palace
<div n="lb"/>of King Kuntibhoja. While Kuntī was staying in the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Kuntibhoja Durvāsas came and stayed in the
<div n="lb"/>the palace as a guest of the King. Kuntī then served
<div n="lb"/>the sage with such devotion and patience that Durvā-
<div n="lb"/>sas at the time of his departure gave Kuntī a divine
<div n="lb"/>mantra for begetting children. The mantra was to be
<div n="lb"/>used only five times. If she called upon any god
<div n="lb"/>repeating that mantra, that god would manifest himself
<div n="lb"/>before her and bless her with a son equal to him in
<div n="lb"/>glory. Out of impatient curiosity of youth Kuntī tried
<div n="lb"/>it before getting married. One morning, seeing the
<div n="lb"/>beautiful and brilliant sun in the sky she invoked him
<div n="lb"/>by the mantra and instantly the Sun stood in all
<div n="lb"/>bewitching brilliance before her and she got of him a
<div n="lb"/>son who was known as Karṇa later. Unmarried as she
<div n="lb"/>was, Kuntī sent the child afloat in the river nearby.
<div n="NI"/>Even after a child-birth Kuntī remained a virgin by
<div n="lb"/>the blessing of the Sun and so got married as a virgin.
<div n="lb"/>Many Kings were present for the Svayaṃvara of
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī and she put the wedding garland round the neck
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṇḍu.
<div n="NI"/>Once Bhīṣma went to the country of Madra. The King
<div n="lb"/>of Madra received Bhīṣma with respect and Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>took Mādrī daughter of Madra as a bride for Pāṇḍu.
<div n="lb"/>He brought her to Hastināpura and married her to
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu. Pāṇḍu lived with his two wives happily and
<div n="lb"/>ruled the country well. Once Pāṇḍu attacked Daśārṇa
<div n="lb"/>with a huge army and defeated him. Later he defeated
<div n="lb"/>Dīrgha, King of Magadha. Then he conducted a
<div n="lb"/>victory march capturing many kingdoms like Kāśī,
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā, Suhma and Puṇḍra. Thus many of the Kings
<div n="lb"/>of Uttara Bhārata became feudatory princes of Pāṇḍu.
<div n="lb"/>In consultation with his brother Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>gave all the wealth he got by his might to Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>and Bhīṣma. He gave enough riches to Vidura also.
<div n="lb"/>Then Pāṇḍu went and stayed with his wives in a
<div n="lb"/>forest to the south of the Himālayas. (Chapters 110 to
<div n="lb"/>114, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Curse of a sage.%} While Pāṇḍu was once walking
<div n="lb"/>with his wives in the forest he saw a couple of deer
<div n="lb"/>playfully running about and the hunting nature in
<div n="lb"/>him made him send an arrow against one of them. The
<div n="lb"/>deer was none other than the sage Kindama who in
<div n="lb"/>the guise of a deer was having sport with his mate.
<div n="lb"/>While falling dead Kindama cursed Pāṇḍu thus “Oh
<div n="lb"/>wretched King, you will fall dead the moment you
<div n="lb"/>touch your wife in amorous sport.” From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards Pāṇḍu could not touch his wives. (For details
<div n="lb"/>see under Kindama).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Sannyāsa and death.%} With the death of the innocent
<div n="lb"/>sage Kindama there occurred a great change in the
<div n="lb"/>life of Pāṇḍu. At first he thought of committing suicide.
[Page565-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>But he changed that decision and started for the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas to perform penance there. Kuntī and
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī accompanied him. They gave away all their
<div n="lb"/>jewels and ornaments as gifts to brahmins. People
<div n="lb"/>followed them to the border of the forests and returned
<div n="lb"/>to the country weeping. Pāṇḍu and his wives visited
<div n="lb"/>such holy places as Nāgaśatādri, Caitraratha, Kālakūṭa,
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas, Gandhamādana and the lake Indradyumna.
<div n="lb"/>Then they went to Śataśṛṅga and started performing
<div n="lb"/>penance. Once Pāṇḍu and wives along with a few
<div n="lb"/>sages went to Brahmaloka to attend a Yāga there. The
<div n="lb"/>long travel toiled them much and on the way Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>wept thinking of his pitiable state of having no issue.
<div n="lb"/>Then Pāṇḍu told them of his helplessness in the matter
<div n="lb"/>because of the curse of the sage Kindama hanging over
<div n="lb"/>him. Then Kuntī confided in him the secret of the
<div n="lb"/>divine mantras in her possession. Pāṇḍu was extremely
<div n="lb"/>pleased and with his permission Kuntī got three sons,
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena and Arjuna. She gave one
<div n="lb"/>chance to Mādrī and she got two sons out of it named
<div n="lb"/>Nakula and Sahadeva.
<div n="NI"/>Pāṇḍu was living happily with his children in Śataśṛṅga
<div n="lb"/>when spring time arrived in the forest with all its
<div n="lb"/>blossoming brilliance and fragrance conducive to
<div n="lb"/>amorous thoughts in all living beings. Pāṇḍu one day
<div n="lb"/>walked alone with Mādrī enjoying the sight of the
<div n="lb"/>flowering plants and trees. Bees and Beetles hummed
<div n="lb"/>around the flowers and on the branches sat the Cuckoos
<div n="lb"/>singing. There was a seductive fragrance all around and
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu was excited beyond controllable limits. Pāṇḍu's
<div n="lb"/>resolution broke down under the exhilarating influence
<div n="lb"/>of the season and despite repeated protests from Mādrī,
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu caught hold of her and embraced her. The
<div n="lb"/>curse of the sage took effect instantaneously and
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu fell down dead.
<div n="NI"/>The inhabitants of Śataśṛṇga assembled there weeping.
<div n="lb"/>In the presence of a huge crowd including the relatives
<div n="lb"/>who had come down from Hastināpura the dead body
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṇḍu was cremated according to religious rites.
<div n="lb"/>Both the wives came forward to end their lives in the
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre of Pāṇḍu. But Kuntī was asked to remain
<div n="lb"/>to take care of the children and Mādrī leaving her
<div n="lb"/>children to the care of Kuntī jumped into the funeral
<div n="lb"/>pyre and ended her life. It was the sage Kaśyapa who
<div n="lb"/>performed the funeral rites of Pānḍḍu. (Chapters 115 to
<div n="lb"/>126, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%After the demise.%} Pāṇḍu's soul is shining in the
<div n="lb"/>court of Yama. (Śloka 25, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu sent a message to Yudhiṣṭhira from Devaloka
<div n="lb"/>that Yudhiṣṭhira should conduct a Rājasūya Yajña.
<div n="lb"/>The message was carried by Nārada. (Śloka 24,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 12, Sabhā Parva). He lives in Indraloka with
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī and Kuntī. (Śloka 15, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Synonyms of Pāṇḍu.%} Pāṇḍu is known under the
<div n="lb"/>following names. Bhārata, Bharatarṣabha, Bhāratasat-
<div n="lb"/>tama, Kaurava, Kauravanandana, Kauravarṣabha,
