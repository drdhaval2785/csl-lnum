JALANDHARA¦. A mightly and valiant Asura. Khaḍga-
<div n="lb"/>romā was his charioteer and Vṛndā was his wife.
<div n="lb"/>Jalandhara was the grandson of the sea of Milk. Once
<div n="lb"/>he met with the headless Rāhu, who said to Jalandha-
<div n="lb"/>ra, the whole story beginning from the churning of the
<div n="lb"/>sea of Milk. Jalandhara, became furious at the gods who
<div n="lb"/>had churned his grandfather. So he collected a big
<div n="lb"/>army of asuras and went to war with the devas. Though
<div n="lb"/>a large number of Asuras were killed in the battle,
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Viṣṇu were defeated and Viṣṇu was taken
<div n="lb"/>captive and hidden under the sea. Finally Paramaśiva
<div n="lb"/>went to fight with the Asura. In the fight Jalandhara
<div n="lb"/>was killed and Viṣṇu was rescued. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 3 to 5). For further details see under Māyā-
<div n="lb"/>śiva.
