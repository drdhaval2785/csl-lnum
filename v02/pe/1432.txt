CANDRA IV¦. (CANDRA DEVA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The child born to Atri by Anasuyā. (See
<div n="lb"/>Purūravas). In Skandha 4 of the Devībhāgavata it is
<div n="lb"/>stated that it was Brahman who was born as Candra.
<div n="lb"/>(See Atri).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Candra led married life with the wife of his guru.%} Tārā,
<div n="lb"/>the very beautiful wife of Bṛhaspati, preceptor of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas happened to reach Candra's home during her
<div n="lb"/>perambulation one day. Candra and Tārā fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with each other at first sight and lived in conjugal
<div n="lb"/>happiness. And thus days passed by. Bṛhaspati, being
<div n="lb"/>informed of the fact on enquiry, deputed his disciples
<div n="lb"/>to bring Tārā back, but to no purpose. Bṛhaspati sent
<div n="lb"/>his disciples again and again to Tārā, but all to no
<div n="lb"/>purpose. Then Bṛhaspati himself went to the house of
<div n="lb"/>Candra and invited Tārā, this time also to no purpose.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this the Deva guru spoke to Candra as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “The brahmin-killer, gold-thief, drunkard, he
<div n="lb"/>who marries another's wife and he who associates him-
<div n="lb"/>self with the above three types are responsible for the
<div n="lb"/>most terrible five sins, and you, therefore, are not fit
<div n="lb"/>enough to reside in Devaloka. Unless you return my
<div n="lb"/>wife to me I will curse you.” None of the threats of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati could shake Candra. He told the Devaguru
<div n="lb"/>that Tārā who had gone to his house on her own accord
<div n="lb"/>would also leave him when she was satiated with him.
<div n="lb"/>These words of Candra made Bṛhaspati all the more
<div n="lb"/>angry. He returned home and waited sometime more
<div n="lb"/>for Tārā's return. But, he got disappointed, and getting
<div n="lb"/>impatient he started again for Candra's house. But,
<div n="lb"/>this time the gatekeepers did not let him in.
<div n="NI"/>Terribly angry at the cruel rebuff Bṛhaspati sought
<div n="lb"/>help of Indra. Indra sent word to Candra asking him
<div n="lb"/>to send Tārā back home or be prepared for war. Even
<div n="lb"/>then Candra refused to yield, and Indra started for
<div n="lb"/>war against Candra. But, there was somehow some dif-
<div n="lb"/>ference among the devas about all this, and the news
<div n="lb"/>reached the asuras. At once Śukra, preceptor of the
<div n="lb"/>asuras and an old enemy of Bṛhaspati met Candra and
[Page171-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>assured him all support in case war broke out between
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Candra. He also strongly advised Candra
<div n="lb"/>not to return Tārā to Bṛhaspati. And, ultimately a
<div n="lb"/>fierce war began between Indra and Candra. All acti-
<div n="lb"/>vities in the world were thrown into confusion and
<div n="lb"/>chaos. At this Brahmā on his haṃsa (swan) came to
<div n="lb"/>the scene and admonished Candra and Śukra. They
<div n="lb"/>could not but obey Brahmā and so were forced to stop
<div n="lb"/>fighting. Moreover, Candra returned Tārā to Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati.
<div n="NI"/>The quarrel and fighting thus ended for the time
<div n="lb"/>being, but another problem cropped up. At the time
<div n="lb"/>Candra returned Tārā to Bṛhaspati she was carrying,
<div n="lb"/>and Bṛhaspati was not aware of the fact. And at last
<div n="lb"/>Tārā delivered an exceptionally beautiful male child.
<div n="lb"/>The naming ceremony of the child was duly performed,
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati himself acting as its father. When the news
<div n="lb"/>reached Candra he sent a messenger to Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb"/>claiming the child was his. Bṛhaspati too claimed its
<div n="lb"/>fatherhood. This controversy developed almost to the
<div n="lb"/>brink of a second devāsura war. At this stage Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>went to Bṛhaspati's house and questioned Tārā as to
<div n="lb"/>who really was her child's father, and she named Candra.
<div n="lb"/>Upon this Brahmā asked Bṛhaspati to release the child
<div n="lb"/>to Candra. Bṛhaspati did so. (Devī Bhāgavata, Pratha-
<div n="lb"/>ma Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Wives of Candra.%} Candra took twentyseven daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ters of Dakṣa as his wives. (Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha). These twentyseven wives are the twenty-
<div n="lb"/>seven stars. Candra circumambulates Mahāmeru along
<div n="lb"/>with these, his twentyseven wives (Stars). (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 163, Verse 33). The names of the
<div n="lb"/>twentyseven wives are given hereunder: Aśvinī, Bha-
<div n="lb"/>raṇī, Kṛttikā, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasu,
<div n="lb"/>Puṣya, Āśleṣā, Janakaṃ, Phālgunī, Uttaraphālgunī,
<div n="lb"/>Hasta, Citrā, Svāti, Viśākhā, Anurādhā, Jyeṣṭhā,
<div n="lb"/>Mūlā, Purvāṣāḍhā, Uttarāṣāḍhā, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>Pracetas, Pūrvaproṣṭhapadā, Uttaraproṣṭhapadā,
<div n="lb"/>Revatī.
<div n="NI"/>{%Solar eclipse according to the Purāṇas.%} The Devas and
<div n="lb"/>the asuras jointly churned Kṣīrābdhi wherefrom emerg-
<div n="lb"/>ed Dhanvantari with the Amṛtakumbha (pot of nectar).
<div n="lb"/>(See Amṛtam).
<div n="NI"/>But an asura māyāvī (magician) called Saiṃhikeya
<div n="lb"/>absconded to Pātāla with the Amṛtakumbha which
<div n="lb"/>nobody noticed as everybody was busy with dividing
<div n="lb"/>other divine objects. Only after the māyāvī's disap-
<div n="lb"/>pearance was it noticed that the Amṛta Kumbha was
<div n="lb"/>missing. At once Mahāviṣṇu assumed the figure of a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful woman, got back the Kumbha and gave it to
<div n="lb"/>the devas. The devas began drinking the amṛtam when,
<div n="lb"/>at the instance of some other devas, Saiṃhikeya, the
<div n="lb"/>māyāvī assuming the form of an old brahmin reached
<div n="lb"/>svarga, got a share of the amṛta and began to drink it.
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya and Candra (Sun and Moon) who were on
<div n="lb"/>guard at the gates divined the secret of the ‘old
<div n="lb"/>brahmin’ and informed Mahāviṣṇu about it. He cut
<div n="lb"/>the throat of the pseudo-brahmin with his Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>Cakra. But, half of the nectar he had drunk stayed
<div n="lb"/>above the throat and the other half below it. Therefore,
<div n="lb"/>though the head and the trunk were severed they
<div n="lb"/>remained alive. These two parts, in course of time,
<div n="lb"/>evolved as Rāhu and Ketu.
<div n="NI"/>When the throat was cut some blood as well as some
<div n="lb"/>amṛta dropped on two places on the ground, and they
[Page172-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>became the red onion and the white onion respecti-
<div n="lb"/>vely. Some vaidika brahmins used to consider the red
<div n="lb"/>onion objectionable for consumption as it was evolved
<div n="lb"/>from blood, while the white onion was considered
<div n="lb"/>usable as it was evolved from amṛtam.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛāhu and Ketu still maintain their hatred for Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>and Candra who had betrayed the asura, who, disguis-
<div n="lb"/>ed as brahmin tried to drink the amṛta. Eclipse is the
<div n="lb"/>phenomenon of Rāhu and Ketu swallowing Sūrya and
<div n="lb"/>Candra as and when opportunity presents itself for it.
<div n="lb"/>But, since the throat is severed from the body, Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>and Candra thus swallowed get out through the throat.
<div n="lb"/>That is the reason why Sūrya and Candra become
<div n="lb"/>visible after the eclipse in over. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddha Kāṇḍa and Bhāgavata Aṣṭama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Candra besame Calf.%} Once emperor Pṛthu trans-
<div n="lb"/>formed Bhāmidevī into a cow and milked from her all
<div n="lb"/>things and provisions. On that occasion it was Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>who acted as Calf. And, following Pṛthu when the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣis milked the cow Candra served as Calf. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Waxing and waning of Candra, the purāṇic story regard-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ding it.%} Of the twentyseven daughters of Dakṣa whom
<div n="lb"/>Candra had married he loved Rohiṇī much more than
<div n="lb"/>the other twentysix wives, and so kept her always with
<div n="lb"/>him. This annoyed the twentysix wives, who complained
<div n="lb"/>about it to Dakṣa. Dakṣa's advice to Candra to treat
<div n="lb"/>all the wives on an equal footing had no effect on him.
<div n="lb"/>So, the twentysix neglected wives again complained to
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa as follows: “We shall stay in the āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>serve you. Soma (Candra) does not associate with us,
<div n="lb"/>he will not accept your advice.”
<div n="NI"/>Though Dakṣa warned Candra a second time, that too
<div n="lb"/>had no effect on him. So the twentysix wives, for the
<div n="lb"/>third time, complained to Dakṣa. Dakṣa got angry at
<div n="lb"/>this and cursed that Candra should suffer from tuber-
<div n="lb"/>culosis. Thus Candra was afflicted by consumption.
<div n="lb"/>Though Candra performed many a yajña to get cured
<div n="lb"/>of the fell disease, they did not produce the desired
<div n="lb"/>effect. Candra remaining a tubercular patient, the
<div n="lb"/>growth of medicinal plants stopped with the result that
<div n="lb"/>all living things contracted consumption. When people
<div n="lb"/>began becoming thinner, the devas asked Candra for
<div n="lb"/>an explanation, and he told them all the details. They
<div n="lb"/>then sought the help of Dakṣa, who gave Candra
<div n="lb"/>redemption from the curse by ordaining that if he dived
<div n="lb"/>in the Sarasvatī tīrtha in the western sea he would be
<div n="lb"/>free from consumption for half of every month. Thence-
<div n="lb"/>forth Candra made it a practice to dive in the Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatītīrtha and that is the reason why Candra is exempt-
<div n="lb"/>ed from Kṣayaroga for fifteen days. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 35).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Candra—King of stars and of medicines.%} During the
<div n="lb"/>reign of emperor Pṛthu, he changed Bhūmidevī into a
<div n="lb"/>cow. Later the Ṛṣis also changed bhūmidevī into a
<div n="lb"/>cow and milked her. It was Candra who served as
<div n="lb"/>calf then. Pleased at this Brahman crowned Candra as
<div n="lb"/>king of the stars and medicines. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>4, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other information about Candra%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Candra is 11,000 sq. yojanas in area, 33,000 yojanas
<div n="lb"/>in circumference and a volume of 5,900 cubic yojanas.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Candra presented two attendants called Maṇi and
[Page172-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Sumati to Subrahmaṇya (Śalya Parva, Chapter 45,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Candra once made a discourse on the superior
<div n="lb"/>qualities of brahmins to Śambarāsura. (Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 13, Southern Text).
<div n="NI"/>(4) All welfare and prosperity accrue to him, who on
<div n="lb"/>full-moon day at moon-rise tenders offerings to Candra
<div n="lb"/>of bread in copper vessels with honey poured into it.
<div n="lb"/>(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 36, Verse, 13, Southern
<div n="lb"/>Text).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Candra is one of the aṣṭa-vasus. Candra had
<div n="lb"/>four sons, Varcas, Śiśira, Prāṇa and Ramaṇa by his
<div n="lb"/>wife named Manoharā. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 66,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Abhimanyu was Candra's son, Varcas, reborn as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Arjuna. (See Abhimanyu).
