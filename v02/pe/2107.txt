DRĀVIḌA¦ BHĀṢĀ. (Dravidian Language). Linguists
<div n="lb"/>have classified the languages of the world under certain
<div n="lb"/>groups. Important among them are the Indo-European
<div n="lb"/>group, the Semitic group, the Hamitic group, the Ural
<div n="lb"/>Altaic group, the South East Asiatic group, the Dravi-
<div n="lb"/>dian group, Austric group, the Bantu group and the
<div n="lb"/>Chinese group.
<div n="NI"/>Almost all the languages in South India belong to the
<div n="lb"/>Dravidian group. The languages of this group are
<div n="lb"/>Tamil, Telugu, Kannaḍa, Malayālam, Tulu, Kuṭaku,
<div n="lb"/>Toṭa, Koṭa, Baḍaka, Kuruk and Brāhūī. Of these
<div n="lb"/>Brāhūī alone is used in the mountain regions of Balu-
<div n="lb"/>cisthan. Linguists like Smīmud and others have stated
<div n="lb"/>that there is a close relation between the Australian and
<div n="lb"/>Dravidian languages. The Āryan language has influence-
<div n="lb"/>ed the Dravidian languages to a great extent. But Tamil
<div n="lb"/>has not been so much influenced as Telugu, Kannaḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Malayālam. It is because Tamil had a great wealth
<div n="lb"/>of literature of its own from ancient times.
<div n="lb"/>The Dravidian group is again divided into four sections:
<div n="lb"/>Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern. Brāhūī
<div n="lb"/>is the only language in the Northern section. Its Ety-
[Page247-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>mology, grammar etc. are like that of the Dravidian
<div n="lb"/>group. But it had been influenced to a large extent by
<div n="lb"/>the Iranian language. Still it keeps its Dravidian cha-
<div n="lb"/>racter.
<div n="NI"/>Telugu, Goṇḍi, Kuruk, Kolāmi, Mālṭa etc. come under
<div n="lb"/>the Eastern group. Of these only Telugu has grown as
<div n="lb"/>a literary language. Telugu is in use from Madras to
<div n="lb"/>Mahendragiri. But it has various sub-divisions and local
<div n="lb"/>differences. The Telugu used in the Districts of Kṛṣṇā
<div n="lb"/>and Godāvarī is considered to be the purest form.
<div n="lb"/>Golari, Sālevāri, Kāmāri, Vāsari, Dāsari etc. are its local
<div n="lb"/>sub-divisions. Over modern Telugu, Sanskrit has its
<div n="lb"/>full sway.
<div n="NI"/>Kannaḍa, Kuṭaku, Toṭa, Koḍa, etc. come under the
<div n="lb"/>western group. Kannaḍa is used in Mysore and the
<div n="lb"/>vicinity of the Districts of Coimbatore, Salem, Bellary,
<div n="lb"/>Anantapore etc. Baḍaka used in the Nilgiris, Kurumpa,
<div n="lb"/>used in the vicinity of Nilgiris, Kuṭaku used in
<div n="lb"/>Coorg, are the sub divisions of Kannaḍa. In edicts from
<div n="lb"/>the 5th century Kannaḍa could be seen in its ancient
<div n="lb"/>form. The modern Kannaḍa has been used from 16th
<div n="lb"/>century onwards. Tulu is in use in places between the
<div n="lb"/>rivers Candragiri in the south of. Southern Canara and
<div n="lb"/>Kalyāṇapurī. Only a few ancient songs could be includ-
<div n="lb"/>ed in Tulu literature. The Malayālam script is used
<div n="lb"/>to write Tulu. But now certain books in Tulu have
<div n="lb"/>been published using Kannaḍa script.
<div n="NI"/>Tamil and Malayālam are the languages of the Sou-
<div n="lb"/>thern section. The oldest literature in the Dravidian
<div n="lb"/>group is in Tamil. The most ancient form of Tamil
<div n="lb"/>is seen in the edicts and stone tables of the 30th century
<div n="lb"/>B.C. The most important among them are the Saṅga
<div n="lb"/>works. The grammatical work ‘Tolkāppiyam, is the
<div n="lb"/>literary grammar of Centamil. Malayālam became an
<div n="lb"/>independent language only by the 8th century A.D. The
<div n="lb"/>close relation that exists between Tamil and Malayālam
<div n="lb"/>is not visible in any other language of the Dravidian
<div n="lb"/>group. By examining the inter-relations of the various
<div n="lb"/>languages in the Dravidian group, and noting
<div n="lb"/>how close or distant the relation is, we can ascertain
<div n="lb"/>which languages separated themselves first from the
<div n="lb"/>original Dravida language.
