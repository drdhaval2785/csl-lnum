ṬIṬṬIBHASARAS¦. A sacred pond near the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki. There is a story about this pond. Once
<div n="lb"/>a water-fowl lived there with his mate. One day
<div n="lb"/>the male fowl went out for food and as he was
<div n="lb"/>returning home he found a few other water-fowls going
<div n="lb"/>that way and the male fowl suspected the chastity of his
<div n="lb"/>wife. The male fowl decided to abandon his mate and
<div n="lb"/>the innocent shefowl prayed to the Aṣṭadikpālakas for
<div n="lb"/>help. The Aṣṭadikpālakas instantly appeared there and
<div n="lb"/>made a pond and said that if the she-fowl could reach
<div n="lb"/>from one shore to the other without getting herself
<div n="lb"/>drowned she must be treated as chaste. The she-fowl
<div n="lb"/>was accordingly put into the waters and asked to swim
<div n="lb"/>to the other shore which she did without any accident.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards the poṇd was called Ṭiṭṭibha-
<div n="lb"/>saras. (Tiṭṭibha = water fowl. Saras = pond).
<div n="NI"/>When Sītā came to the āśrama of Vālmīki after being
<div n="lb"/>abandoned by Śrī Rāma, Vālmīki wanted to test her
<div n="lb"/>chastity. So the sages asked Sītā to enter the pond and
<div n="lb"/>reach the other shore. “Oh goddess of Earth, if even in
[Page791-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>my dreams no other person than my husband has
<div n="lb"/>entered my thoughts, let me reach the other shore safe.”
<div n="lb"/>So saying Sītā entered the water and the goddess of
<div n="lb"/>Earth placed her in her lap and took her to the other
<div n="lb"/>shore. Sītā did not get even wet. All the sages called her
<div n="lb"/>‘Mahāsādhvī’ meaning supremely chaste woman.
<div n="lb"/>(Taraṅga 1, Alaṅkāravatīlambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
