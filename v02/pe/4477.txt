MĀYĀSĪTĀ¦. When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were in exile
<div n="lb"/>in the forests with Sītā, Rāvaṇa came to carry away
<div n="lb"/>Sītā. At that time the real Sītā disappeared in Agni
<div n="lb"/>and in her place a false Sītā was installed. It was this
<div n="lb"/>phantom Sītā who was carried away by Rāvaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>who lived in Laṅkā till the time of Rāvaṇa's death. It
<div n="lb"/>was this Māyāsītā whom Rāma asked to jump into the
<div n="lb"/>fire to test her purity. At that time Māyāsītā disap-
<div n="lb"/>peared and the real Sītā came out from the fire. (See
<div n="lb"/>under SĪTĀ).
