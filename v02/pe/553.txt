AṢṬAVIVĀHA¦(S). Eight kinds of marriage. (1) Brāhma
<div n="lb"/>(2) Daiva (3) Ārṣa (4) Prājāpatya (5) Gāndharva
<div n="lb"/>(6) Āsura (7) Rākṣasa (8) Paiśāca. Brāhma is the one
<div n="lb"/>where the father gives her daughter with sacred water
<div n="lb"/>to a bachelor without accepting anything in return. When
<div n="lb"/>the father gives his daughter to the priest at the time
<div n="lb"/>of a yāga it is called Daiva. It is Ārṣa if the father gives
<div n="lb"/>the daughter and gets in return a cow or bullock. When
<div n="lb"/>the father gives the daughter with her blessings it is
<div n="lb"/>Prājāpatya. The marriage between two lovers is Gān-
<div n="lb"/>dharva. It is Āsura when the male takes his mate by
<div n="lb"/>force and it is Paiśācika (most cruel and mean) when
<div n="lb"/>the girl is taken as his wife when she is in a state of
<div n="lb"/>unconsciousness.
