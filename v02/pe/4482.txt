MĀYĀVĪ¦. An asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Māyāvī was born to the great architect of
<div n="lb"/>the Dānavas, Maya, of his wife Hemā, a nymph. Maya
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with Hemā when he once found her dancing
<div n="lb"/>in Devaloka and the devas coming to know of it gave her
<div n="lb"/>in marriage to Maya. Maya took Hemā to the southern
<div n="lb"/>side of the Himālayas and constructing a city there
<div n="lb"/>called Hemapura stayed there happily. They got two
<div n="lb"/>sons named Māyāvī and Dundubhi. (Uttara Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Death.%} Valorous Māyāvī fought against anybody and
<div n="lb"/>everybody. He once challenged Bāli to a fight. But the
<div n="lb"/>mighty blows of Bāli were unbearable to him and the
<div n="lb"/>defeated Māyāvī ran away from Bāli and hid himself
<div n="lb"/>in a big cave. Bāli followed him and when he reached
<div n="lb"/>the mouth of the cave he posted his brother Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>there with instructions to shut tight the opening of the
<div n="lb"/>cave in case he died in the cave in the fight. He said
<div n="lb"/>that if blood flowed from the cave the dead person was
<div n="lb"/>Māyāvī and if milk flowed from the cave the dead person
<div n="lb"/>was himself. In the cave a great fight ensued in which
<div n="lb"/>Māyāvī was killed. But Māyāvī by his powers of magic
<div n="lb"/>made the blood that flowed out look like milk for
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva and the latter thinking that it was his brother
<div n="lb"/>who was killed shut tight the mouth of the cave and went
<div n="lb"/>his way. (Sarga 9, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Pūrva Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
