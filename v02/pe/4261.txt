MĀLYAVĀN II¦. Son of the demon Sukeśa. He was the
<div n="lb"/>brother of Mālī and Sumālī.
<div n="NI"/>This Mālyavān was the father of Rāvaṇa's mother.
<div n="lb"/>They were all living in Pātāla but when Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>obtained his boon he sent away Kubera from Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>and became the ruler of Laṅkā. Mālyavān and other
<div n="lb"/>demons followed Rāvaṇa to Laṅkā and stayed with him
<div n="lb"/>confirming his sovereignty over the place.
<div n="NI"/>In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle Sugrīva stole the crown of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and kicked him on his face. Ashamed of the
<div n="lb"/>insult Rāvaṇa went back to his palace and the first per-
<div n="lb"/>son he saw was Mālyavān. The old man had come to
<div n="lb"/>advise Rāvaṇa to give back Sītā to Śrī Rāma. But
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa did not like the advice and tore to pieces the
<div n="lb"/>letter of advice. (For more details see under Mālī).
