KAIKEYĪ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} One of the wives of Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>ratha, who had three wives, Kausalyā, Kaikeyī and
<div n="lb"/>Sumitrā. It is mentioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 70, Stanza 28 that Kaikeyī was
<div n="lb"/>the sister of Yudhājit, the King of Kekaya. Kekaya
<div n="lb"/>was seven days’ journey away from Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Getting boons.%} In days of old there was a battle
<div n="lb"/>between the devas and the asuras and Daśaratha went
<div n="lb"/>to the world of Devas, with Kaikeyī, in a chariot to
<div n="lb"/>help Indra against the Asuras. The devas were in a
<div n="lb"/>sorry plight due to the illusive and sorcerous mode of
<div n="lb"/>fighting of Śambara the Asura and his men. Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>faced the Asuras in ten directions at the same time and
<div n="lb"/>fought with them. In this fight his chariot had to be
<div n="lb"/>turned to every direction and up and down so swiftly
<div n="lb"/>that the bolt of the wheel slipped out and the wheel
<div n="lb"/>was about to come off when Kaikeyī inserted her thumb
<div n="lb"/>in the hole of the bolt and kept the chariot safe and
<div n="lb"/>steady. The King was not aware of this bravery on the
<div n="lb"/>part of his wife. At last when he came to know of this
<div n="lb"/>he promised to give her two boons. The queen said
<div n="lb"/>that she would ask for those two boons later as she
<div n="lb"/>didn't want anything then. After this the King and
<div n="lb"/>the queen returned to their country. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Sarga 9; Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Request for the boons and the forest life of Śrī Rāma.%} As
<div n="lb"/>the celebration of anointing Śrī Rāma as the Heir
<div n="lb"/>apparent in Ayodhyā was going on, the humpy
<div n="lb"/>Mantharā approached Kaikeyī and advised her on the
<div n="lb"/>ways of making her son Bharata King and sending Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma to forest. At first Kaikeyī refused to agree to
<div n="lb"/>this, but at last she succumbed to the repeated advice
<div n="lb"/>of Mantharā. Daśaratha came to see Kaikeyī who was
<div n="lb"/>lying in grief. Making use of this opportunity Kaikeyī
<div n="lb"/>requested for the granting of the two boons promised
<div n="lb"/>earlier. One boon was that Bharata should be anointed
<div n="lb"/>as heir apparent making use of the preparations made
<div n="lb"/>for Śrī Rāma and the other boon was that Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>should live in forest, wearing bark of trees and matted
<div n="lb"/>hair for fourteen years. When Daśaratha heard these
<div n="lb"/>requests he became unconscious. But he granted her
<div n="lb"/>wishes.
