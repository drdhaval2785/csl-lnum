YĀSKA¦. A famous Sanskrit Grammarian of ancient times.
<div n="lb"/>Although the people of India always believed in the
<div n="lb"/>greatness of the Vedas, the Vedas became unintelli-
<div n="lb"/>gible even to scholars owing to changes in language and
<div n="lb"/>differences in grammar. It was Yāska and Sāyaṇa who
<div n="lb"/>saved the country from that plight. Yāska became famous
<div n="lb"/>by composing “Nirukta” (etymology). There is a refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence to this ancient sage in Mahābhārata, Chapter 342,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 72.
