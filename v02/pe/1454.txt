<div n="lb"/>devotee of Śiva. As he performed great sacrifices and
<div n="lb"/>gave away money and materials in gift to those who pray-
<div n="lb"/>ed for them, an attendant of Śiva called Maṇibhadra
<div n="lb"/>once gave him a gem, which possessed supernatural
<div n="lb"/>powers. Attracted by the lustre and glare of the gem
<div n="lb"/>many kings wanted to purchase it. But Candrasena
<div n="lb"/>refused to sell it. Much incensed at the refusal, the enemy
<div n="lb"/>kings set out to fight Candrasena, who then took refuge
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahākāla temple in Ujjayanī the idol installed in
<div n="lb"/>which was Śivaliṅga. Lord Śiva then appeared to him
<div n="lb"/>and granted him salvation. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śaniprado-
<div n="lb"/>ṣamāhātmyam).
