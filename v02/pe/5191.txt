PIṄGALĀ III¦. A woman of the city of Ayodhyā. Once
<div n="lb"/>this woman approached Śrī Rāma with amorous
<div n="lb"/>intentions and Śrī Rāma who was strictly observing a
<div n="lb"/>vow of one-wife refused to satisfy her desire and said:—
<div n="lb"/>“During the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa you will be born as a
<div n="lb"/>servant maid of Kaṃsa and then I will in my form as
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa accept you.”
[Page589-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Sītā on hearing this cursed Piṇgalā. She said “Oh
<div n="lb"/>beautiful woman who has approached my husband
<div n="lb"/>with amorous intentions, you will have three bends in
<div n="lb"/>your body when you are born next as the servant maid
<div n="lb"/>of Kaṃsa.” Piṅgalā weeping bitterly craved for
<div n="lb"/>pardon and then Sītā said that Kṛṣṇa would make her
<div n="lb"/>perfect. (Vilāsa Kāṇḍa, Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa).
