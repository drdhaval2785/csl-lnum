MAUDGALYA¦ (MAUDGALA). A maharṣi. This
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi once cursed Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once Maudgalya was sitting in Svastikāsana resting his
<div n="lb"/>shoulders on his yogic staff in the forest of Kadamba.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa returning after his victory march came that way.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the sage sitting in a wonderfully queer posture
[Page494-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa was amused and playfully tapped the staff
<div n="lb"/>with his Candrahāsa. The staff broke into two and
<div n="lb"/>Maudgalya fell flat on the ground breaking his spine.
<div n="lb"/>The sage was furious and he cursed Rāvaṇa saying
<div n="lb"/>that his Candrahāsa would thenceforth have no effect
<div n="lb"/>at all. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
