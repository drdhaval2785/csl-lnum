MĀNDHĀTĀ¦. A King of pre-eminence in the dynasty
<div n="lb"/>of Ikṣvāku.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu were
<div n="lb"/>born—Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān—
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku—Vikukṣi—Śaśāda—Purañjaya—Kakutstha—
<div n="lb"/>Anenas—Pṛthulāśva—Prasenajit—Yuvanāśva—
<div n="lb"/>Māndhātā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Yuvanāśva, father of Māndhātā had a
<div n="lb"/>hundred wives. Still he had no children. Greatly
<div n="lb"/>griefstricken by the lack of a son he went to the forests
<div n="lb"/>to see people of virtue and piety. During his
<div n="lb"/>wandering in the forest he happened to reach a club
<div n="lb"/>of sages. Yuvanāśva went and sat in their midst. He
<div n="lb"/>was happy to be in their midst but was worried in his
<div n="lb"/>mind and so he sent up deep sighs as he sat there sad and
<div n="lb"/>śilent. The sages asked him why he looked so sad and
<div n="lb"/>the King crying like a child told them the cause of his
<div n="lb"/>grief. The sages took pity on him and made him
<div n="lb"/>conduct the yāga ‘Indradaivata’. They brought a jug
<div n="lb"/>of water made potent by recitals of mantras to be
<div n="lb"/>given to the queens to make them pregnant and placed
<div n="lb"/>the pot in the yāgaśālā. The yāga was coming to an
<div n="lb"/>end. One day the King felt unusually thirsty and
<div n="lb"/>unwilling to disturb the sages who were taking rest the
<div n="lb"/>King entered the yāgaśālā and finding a jug there
<div n="lb"/>full of water drank from it and quenched his thirst,
<div n="lb"/>little knowing that it contained the water made
<div n="lb"/>potent for a specific purpose by mantras. The next day
<div n="lb"/>when the sages went to the yāgaśālā they found the
<div n="lb"/>jug almost empty and were worried and started
<div n="lb"/>making enquiries. The King then confessed what he
<div n="lb"/>had done. The sages said that it was futile to fight
<div n="lb"/>against fate and somehow finished the yāga and went
<div n="lb"/>to their āśramas.
<div n="NI"/>The King became pregnant and after ten months a
<div n="lb"/>child came out bursting open the right side of his
<div n="lb"/>stomach. The King consulted his ministers as to
<div n="lb"/>what should be done with the child and on their
<div n="lb"/>advice the child was taken to the forests and left
<div n="lb"/>there. But the child was protected by the Devas and
[Page476-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>they enquired among themselves as to whose breast-
<div n="lb"/>feeding it would get when Indra appeared and said
<div n="lb"/>“Māṃ Dhātā”, meaning it would drink me. That was
<div n="lb"/>how the child got the name ‘Māndhātā’. Indra thrust
<div n="lb"/>the child's big toe into its mouth and the child began to
<div n="lb"/>suck milk through it. Māndhātā who grew thus drink-
<div n="lb"/>ing its own toe became a mighty man of renown. (7th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Administration of the state and marriage.%} When
<div n="lb"/>Māndhātā became a man of great strength his father
<div n="lb"/>died and he ascended the throne and became an
<div n="lb"/>Emperor of great fame. He conquered many kingdoms.
<div n="lb"/>He made his enemies flee from him. Because he inti-
<div n="lb"/>midated the dasyus he got the name Trasadasyu. He
<div n="lb"/>married the perfect-figured chaste daughter Bindumatī
<div n="lb"/>of Śaśabindurāja. She got two sons named Purukutsa
<div n="lb"/>and Mucukunda.
<div n="NI"/>The Purāṇas state that Māndhātā had another son
<div n="lb"/>named Ambarīṣa and fifty daughters who were all
<div n="lb"/>married to a sage named Saubhari.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How he caused rains in the country.%} Māndhātā ruled
<div n="lb"/>the country very virtuously without at any time going
<div n="lb"/>against truth and justice and his country became
<div n="lb"/>prosperous. Once it so happened that there were no
<div n="lb"/>rains for three successive years in the country and
<div n="lb"/>the greatly worried King went to the forests to know
<div n="lb"/>from the great sages there the reason for such a
<div n="lb"/>calamity. The sages told the King thus: “Oh King,
<div n="lb"/>of all yugas Kṛtayuga is the best. This yuga is a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin-predominant one and Dharma stands on
<div n="lb"/>four legs. Penance is for brahmins only and no man
<div n="lb"/>of any other caste can do penance in this yuga. But
<div n="lb"/>in your country a Śūdra is performing penance and
<div n="lb"/>that is why the clouds refuse to shower rains. Kill him
<div n="lb"/>and then the evil will go”. Hearing this Māndhātā
<div n="lb"/>replied, “I will never kill an innocent ascetic. Teach
<div n="lb"/>me my duty at this time of peril”. The sages were
<div n="lb"/>pleased at the reply of the King and advised him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Oh King, start observing Vrata on the ekādaśī day.
<div n="lb"/>(Eleventh day in each half of a month). The ekādaśī
<div n="lb"/>which falls in the bright half of Bhādrapada is called
<div n="lb"/>‘Padmanābha’, and if you observe it by its cogency you
<div n="lb"/>will get not only rains but prosperity and happiness free
<div n="lb"/>from misery of any kind. You must persuade your
<div n="lb"/>subjects also to observe this”.
<div n="NI"/>The King on returning to his palace started observing
<div n="lb"/>‘ekādaśī’ along with his subjects of all the four castes
<div n="lb"/>and then it started to rain. Rains came in plenty and
<div n="lb"/>all the crops were rich. The subjects became happy.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 59, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
