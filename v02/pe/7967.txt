VĀMADEVA¦. An ancient hermit.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Vāmadeva and Śala.%} Three sons named Śala, Dala
<div n="lb"/>and Bala were born to King Parīkṣit by his wife Suśo-
<div n="lb"/>bhanā, a princess of Maṇḍūka. In due course, King
<div n="lb"/>Parīkṣit anointed his eldest son Śala as King and went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest for penance.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śala went to the forest to hunt. While chasing
<div n="lb"/>a deer, the King asked his charioteer to bring horses
<div n="lb"/>capable of overtaking the deer. The charioteer told the
<div n="lb"/>King that such horses were available at the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Vāmadeva. They went to the hermitage of Vāma-
<div n="lb"/>deva and got the horses on condition that they would
<div n="lb"/>be returned.
<div n="NI"/>After the hunting, Śala reached his capital. Seeing the
<div n="lb"/>beauty and the vigorous nature of the horses, the King
<div n="lb"/>did not like to part with them. Vāmadeva sent his
<div n="lb"/>disciple to the court of the King to take the horses back.
<div n="lb"/>But the King sent him back empty-handed. Vāmadeva
<div n="lb"/>got angry. He came in person and demanded his horses.
<div n="lb"/>The King replied that Brahmins did not require such
<div n="lb"/>horses. While these two were quarrelling with each
<div n="lb"/>other, some fierce giants came there and pierced Śala
<div n="lb"/>with a trident and killed him. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 192).
