BHARTṚHARI¦. A famous Sanskrit poet.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He was the son of Vidyāsāgara, a great brahmin
<div n="lb"/>scholar, who lived in Pāṭalīputra. There is a legend
<div n="lb"/>about the birth of Bhartṛhari in Uttara Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyāsāgara while young learnt the Vedas from his
<div n="lb"/>guru. But he was not satisfied with that study and
<div n="lb"/>wanted to learn more about all śāstras and so he started
<div n="lb"/>on a tour to find out a guru who would teach him all
<div n="lb"/>he wanted. On his way he met several great scholars
<div n="lb"/>but none came up to his standard of a guru. One day
<div n="lb"/>tired after a long journey he reached a mountain valley.
<div n="lb"/>Washing his hands and feet in a nearby river and
<div n="lb"/>quenching his thirst he went and sat down under a
<div n="lb"/>banyan tree to rest. The cool breeze sent the tired
<div n="lb"/>brahmin to sleep and he slept.
<div n="NI"/>A Brahmarākṣasa who was living on the top of the ban-
<div n="lb"/>yan tree when it became midday descended from
<div n="lb"/>the tree to perform the sacred rites of the day and found
<div n="lb"/>a man lying asleep. By the sacred thread on his body
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmarākṣasa surmised that the man was a brah-
<div n="lb"/>min and woke him up. Waking up Vidyāsāgara found
<div n="lb"/>to his surprise the bearded Brahmarākṣasa standing be-
<div n="lb"/>fore him and after mutual enquiries Vidyāsāgara told
<div n="lb"/>him of his mission. The Brahmarākṣasa told him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Boy, let your name Vidyāsāgara (ocean of learning)
<div n="lb"/>be true in your life. I am acquainted with many śāst-
<div n="lb"/>ras and I shall teach you everything I know. But there
<div n="lb"/>are certain conditions for the same which you have to
<div n="lb"/>observe. You must live with me for six months and
<div n="lb"/>should fast during that period behaving yourself as
<div n="lb"/>one under a vow. I shall, however, teach you a mantra
<div n="lb"/>which would help you to remain unaffected by hunger,
<div n="lb"/>thirst or sleep. If you are prepared to accept these terms
<div n="lb"/>and become my disciple I shall quench your thirst for
<div n="lb"/>knowledge. Vidyāsāgara willingly agreed to his terms
<div n="lb"/>and became his student.
<div n="NI"/>Both of them then climbed on the banyan tree and the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmarākṣasa sat in his usual place on a branch on
<div n="lb"/>the tree and Vidyāsāgara on a branch just below it. The
<div n="lb"/>instructions started and continued for six months.
<div n="lb"/>Vidyāsāgara never felt thirst or hunger during that
<div n="lb"/>period. When the teaching was complete the Brahma-
[Page125-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>rākṣasa bade farewell to his disciple and departed leaving
<div n="lb"/>his body behind.
<div n="NI"/>Vidyāsāgara then got down from the tree and performed
<div n="lb"/>the obsequies of his guru. Vidyāsāgara while he was
<div n="lb"/>learning used to note down the instructions of the guru
<div n="lb"/>on the leaves of the banyan tree. It had come to a huge
<div n="lb"/>bundle on completion. Taking the bundle along with
<div n="lb"/>him Vidyāsāgara left for his country. By the time he
<div n="lb"/>left the forest area the power of the mantra faded and
<div n="lb"/>Vidyāsāgara began to feel the pangs of hunger and
<div n="lb"/>thirst. By dusk he reached Kaliṅga and there he came
<div n="lb"/>to the door of a dancing girl named Mandākinī. The
<div n="lb"/>door was locked as the owner was away in a Śiva temple
<div n="lb"/>nearby. Exhausted by the journey, hungry and thirsty,
<div n="lb"/>Vidyāsāgara lay down on the doorstep and soon fell
<div n="lb"/>asleep with the leaf-bundle as a pillow. Mandākinī when
<div n="lb"/>she returned from the temple at about ten at night saw
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin sleeping on the doorstep, tired and exhaust-
<div n="lb"/>ed. She soon asked her servants to get him inside and
<div n="lb"/>sent for a doctor. By the clever treatment of the doctor
<div n="lb"/>and the expert nursing of Mandākinī, Vidyāsāgara sur-
<div n="lb"/>vived. When he was fit for travel he started to go but
<div n="lb"/>Mandākinī objected and requested him to marry her.
<div n="lb"/>Vidyāsāgara did not agree to it and she took him to the
<div n="lb"/>King and told him all that had happened. Finding
<div n="lb"/>Vidyāsāgara to be one with great erudition and good
<div n="lb"/>manners he decided that Vidyāsāgara should marry
<div n="lb"/>his daughter (a Kṣatriya), daughter of his minister
<div n="lb"/>(a brahmin), daughter of Kulapati (a vaiśya), and
<div n="lb"/>also Mandākinī (a Śūdra). There was an injunction in
<div n="lb"/>those days that a brahmin should marry a Śūdra only
<div n="lb"/>after having married from all the higher castes. The
<div n="lb"/>decision of the King surmounted this difficulty for
<div n="lb"/>Vidyāsāgara to marry the śūdra girl, Mandākinī.
<div n="lb"/>Marriages were all conducted in order. The King's
<div n="lb"/>daughter bore the name Kalāvatī, the minister's Mālatī
<div n="lb"/>and Kulapati's Sumaṅgalī. Each delivered a son. The
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy was named Vararuci, the Kṣatriya boy,
<div n="lb"/>Vikramāditya, the Vaiśya boy, Bhaṭṭi and the Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>boy, Bhartṛhari.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kingship.%} When the King of Kaliṅga became old
<div n="lb"/>he gave the kingdom to Vidyāsāgara and when Vidyā-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara died all his other sons made Bhartṛhari the King.
<div n="lb"/>Bhartṛhari gave his father on his death-bed a promise
<div n="lb"/>that he would see that no sons were born to him.
<F>1) There is a belief that if a son is born to a Śūdra who was himself born of a brahmin the brahmin father would go to hell.</F>
<div n="lb"/>So though Bhartṛhari married three wives he was care-
<div n="lb"/>ful enough not to produce any children by them.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhartṛhari becomes a sannyāsī.%} Bhartṛhari was living
<div n="lb"/>happily with his wife when one day a yogī of divine
<div n="lb"/>disposition came to his house and giving him a ripe
<div n="lb"/>mango said: “If you eat this mango you will never
<div n="lb"/>become old. It is because you who are perfect in edu-
<div n="lb"/>cation and fortune should live long for the benefit of
<div n="lb"/>the people that I am giving you this.” So saying he
<div n="lb"/>gave the mango and left the place. When the sannyāsī
<div n="lb"/>left him Bhartṛhari thought thus: “After some years
<div n="lb"/>my wife would become old and die. What is the use
<div n="lb"/>of my remaining alive after she is gone. So this mango
<div n="lb"/>should be given to her. Let her live long.” He,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, gave the mango to his wife explaining
<div n="lb"/>to her the greatness of the fruit. That wife whom poor
<div n="lb"/>Bhartṛhari accepted to be very loving and chaste
<div n="lb"/>had a lover. He was none other than the horse-
[Page125-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>groom of her husband and that prostitute thought
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Of what use is my life when my lover is dead.
<div n="lb"/>Let him live for ever”. So thinking she sent for her
<div n="lb"/>lover and giving him the mango explained to him the
<div n="lb"/>greatness of the thing. But the horse-groom was well
<div n="lb"/>devoted to his wife and desiring that his wife should
<div n="lb"/>remain young always he gave it to her. The groom's
<div n="lb"/>wife was a servant-maid of the palace and it was at the
<div n="lb"/>time of her departure from the palace after her day's
<div n="lb"/>work that she was given the mango by the horse-groom
<div n="lb"/>and so she carried it home in her hand. Bhartṛhari
<div n="lb"/>who was returning from somewhere to the palace saw
<div n="lb"/>the woman carrying the mango and questioned her and
<div n="lb"/>knew how she got it. On coming to the palace he sent
<div n="lb"/>for the horse-groom and though at first the horse-groom
<div n="lb"/>tried to shield the queen, he was compelled to tell the
<div n="lb"/>truth in the end. The truth pained him much “Phew!
<div n="lb"/>It was this wretched and unfaithful woman whom I was
<div n="lb"/>believing to be very chaste and loving. Woman can never
<div n="lb"/>be believed. Look, she has fallen in love with an ugly-
<div n="lb"/>looking servant of mine and unless he was her lover she
<div n="lb"/>would not have given this mango to him. It is better
<div n="lb"/>that this matter is not pursued any further now. We
<div n="lb"/>will decide about the future course of action later”.
<div n="lb"/>Thinking thus, he sent away the horse-groom and went
<div n="lb"/>to his bed-chamber and lay there immersed in thoughts.
<div n="lb"/>The horse-groom immediately informed the queen of
<div n="lb"/>everything that took place and the queen felt sorry that
<div n="lb"/>her secret had come to light. She knew that besides the
<div n="lb"/>punishment that her lover would get her name would
<div n="lb"/>also be blackened and so decided to kill her husband
<div n="lb"/>before the affair became public. At once she made an
<div n="lb"/>oṭṭaṭa (flat bread made of wheat or rice) with poison in
<div n="lb"/>it and bringing it to the bed-room told her husband thus
<div n="lb"/>with much pretended affection. “It will take some time
<div n="lb"/>for your lunch to be ready. Let not you lie with an
<div n="lb"/>empty stomach. Eat this now”. So saying she placed
<div n="lb"/>the bread in the hands of Bhartṛhari and left the room.
<div n="NI"/>Bhartṛhari suspected foul play and mused “This bread
<div n="lb"/>has been prepared by her with poison to kill me. It is
<div n="lb"/>better to give up living with her. There is no doubt
<div n="lb"/>about it. Of the four āśramas the fourth, Sannyāsa, is
<div n="lb"/>the best. It is pleasant and sorrowless. Therefore gra-
<div n="lb"/>dually that āśrama should be accepted”. Thinking thus
<div n="lb"/>he came out from his room with the bread and placed
<div n="lb"/>it hidden somewhere in the lower end of the roof of the
<div n="lb"/>house remarking “Oṭṭappam Vīṭṭeccuṭum” (The oṭṭaṭa
<div n="lb"/>will burn the house). Then taking an earthern bowl for
<div n="lb"/>begging he left the house unnoticed by any. The moment
<div n="lb"/>Bhartṛhari left the house the house caught fire and
<div n="lb"/>everything in it was burnt to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>Bhartṛhari renouncing all and changing himself into
<div n="lb"/>the robes of a sannyāsī went about living by begging.
<div n="lb"/>After some time he decided that he would never beg but
<div n="lb"/>would eat only that which others gave him voluntarily.
<div n="lb"/>He had by that time reached a big temple
<F>2) This temple is believed to be the Chidaṃbaraṃ Temple.</F> in south
<div n="lb"/>India where in one of the entrances to the temple, the
<div n="lb"/>east one, was sitting the famous sannyāsī Paṭṭanatt
<div n="lb"/>Pillayār. Bhartṛhari, therefore, went and sat at the
<div n="lb"/>western entrance with his bowl before him. Whatever
<div n="lb"/>food fell into the bowl was eaten by him. Sometimes
<div n="lb"/>for days together he went without food. But he never
<div n="lb"/>was sick or felt weak.
[Page126-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>One day a beggar went to the eastern gate and asked
<div n="lb"/>Paṭṭanatt Pillayār for alms. Pillayār said, “I am also a
<div n="lb"/>beggar like you. I have nothing in my hand to give you.
<div n="lb"/>But there is a man sitting in the western gate. He is a
<div n="lb"/>rich man and he may give you something”. The beggar
<div n="lb"/>went to Bhartṛhari and asked for alms. Bhartṛhari
<div n="lb"/>also expressed his helplessness in the matter. But then
<div n="lb"/>the beggar said “The man sitting at the opposite entrance
<div n="lb"/>told me that you were a rich man.” Bhartṛhari smiled.
<div n="lb"/>He knew then why Paṭṭanatt Pillayār said so. A man who
<div n="lb"/>has renounced everything need not keep even a bowl to
<div n="lb"/>beg. The bowl was a luxury and a sign of wealth.
<div n="lb"/>Bhartṛhari threw away the bowl and remained at the
<div n="lb"/>temple entrance till the end of his life. It was while
<div n="lb"/>sitting there that he wrote his famous poems.
<div n="NI"/>4) His well-known works are: (1) The Nīti Śataka (2)
<div n="lb"/>The Śṛṅgāra Śataka (3) The Vairāgya Śataka and (4)
<div n="lb"/>The Subhāṣitas.
