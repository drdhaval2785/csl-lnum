PAÑCATANTRA¦.
<div n="NI"/>A. {%General information.%} An ancient book of distinction
<div n="lb"/>written by the scholar Viṣṇuśarmā in the form of
<div n="lb"/>stories for the use of children to give them an idea of
<div n="lb"/>the different aspects of life.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} There is a statement in the preface itself
<div n="lb"/>regarding the composition of this book: “Three sons
<div n="lb"/>were born to an emperor named Amaraśakti. All the
<div n="lb"/>three were dull-witted. The emperor was very sorry
<div n="lb"/>for them but found no way to improve them. Greatly
<div n="lb"/>disappointed the King called the royal council and
<div n="lb"/>told them about his sons. Then one of the members of
<div n="lb"/>the council, a man named Sumati, stood up and said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh best of Kings, let us not try to teach your children
<div n="lb"/>the śāstras one by one. It will not only be unpleasant
<div n="lb"/>study but would also take a long time to complete.
<div n="lb"/>If we can mix all the śāstras cleverly and make it palat-
<div n="lb"/>able like sweetmeats the children would take it
<div n="lb"/>easily. There is a suitable man also for this work in our
<div n="lb"/>state. He is Viṣṇuśarmā, a kind-hearted scholar who
<div n="lb"/>is not only well-versed in all the sāstras but also an
<div n="lb"/>adept in the art of the up-bringing of children. I am
<div n="lb"/>sure he would make your children wise and learned.”
<div n="lb"/>When the emperor heard this he sent for Viṣṇuśarmā
<div n="lb"/>and told him everything. After understanding well the
<div n="lb"/>nature of his would-be disciples and the ambition of
<div n="lb"/>their father, Viṣṇuśarmā took charge of his wards and
<div n="lb"/>within six months he taught the sons of the emperor
<div n="lb"/>the science of government. The stories which he used
<div n="lb"/>to teach them the science of administration were all
<div n="lb"/>compiled into a volume called Pañcatantra.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%A general idea of the book.%} The book contains five
<div n="lb"/>divisions each division illustrating one tantra (tact,
<div n="lb"/>diplomacy) by several stories. It contains prose and
<div n="lb"/>verse. The first tantra is called Mitrabheda. Stories
<div n="lb"/>under this head explain the philosophy of “Divide
<div n="lb"/>and rule” in politics. The main characters in these
<div n="lb"/>stories are two foxes named Karaṭaka and Damanaka.
<div n="lb"/>Stories under Mitrabheda relate to how these sly foxes
<div n="lb"/>enjoy themselves in breaking the intimacy between a
<div n="lb"/>lion and an ox using slander against each other.
<div n="lb"/>‘Mitralābha’ is the theme of the next tantra. It is an
<div n="lb"/>advice that you should select your friends with
<div n="lb"/>care selecting them only after studying them in detail
<div n="lb"/>properly. The author has selected as characters in
<div n="lb"/>his stories for this purpose a tortoise a deer, a crow
<div n="lb"/>and a rat. The third tantra is called Kākolūkīya. This
<div n="lb"/>deals with the evils behind an intimacy between born
<div n="lb"/>enemies. The main characters in the stories relating
[Page554-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to this are a crow and an owl. The fourth tantra is
<div n="lb"/>called Labdhapraṇāśa. It describes how a man loses
<div n="lb"/>what has come into his possession by his foolishness. A
<div n="lb"/>monkey and a crocodile are the characters in this story.
<div n="lb"/>The fifth tantra is Aparīkṣitakāraka. It deals with the
<div n="lb"/>bad side of not looking into all the possible aspects of
<div n="lb"/>what you hear. Several stories are there to illustrate
<div n="lb"/>this point.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Popularity of the book.%} Though no correct records
<div n="lb"/>are there in history in support of the belief, it is believ-
<div n="lb"/>ed that Amaraśakti was the ruler of Mahilāropya in
<div n="lb"/>Deccan and that Pañcatantra must have originated
<div n="lb"/>from there. But Pañcatantra received a global publicity
<div n="lb"/>and popularity and was translated from Sanskrit into
<div n="lb"/>many other languages. Directed by King Kosru Anu-
<div n="lb"/>ṣirva, a Persian poet named Buryoe translated it into
<div n="lb"/>the Persian language during the period 531-575 A.D.
<div n="lb"/>That translation is not available at present. In the year
<div n="lb"/>570 A.D. it was translated into the Syrian language by
<div n="lb"/>a poet named Bud. A scholar named Abdulla Ibaal
<div n="lb"/>Mogaffa in the year 750 A. D. translated it into the
<div n="lb"/>Arabic language. It was from this Arabic translation that
<div n="lb"/>it was translated into many European languages. The
<div n="lb"/>Greek translation appeared in the year 1080 A.D.,
<div n="lb"/>Hebrew in 1100 A.D., Latin in 1270 A.D., German in
<div n="lb"/>1480 A.D., Italian in 1582 A.D. and French in 1678
<div n="lb"/>A.D. Next to the Bible this is the book which has
<div n="lb"/>received the greatest publicity and popularity. The
<div n="lb"/>great linguist Hertel says that Pañcatantra has appeared
<div n="lb"/>in about 200 translations in fifty different languages.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Period of composition.%} Because the translation into
<div n="lb"/>the Syrian language appeared in the year 570 A.D it
<div n="lb"/>must have been composed earlier than that date. Again,
<div n="lb"/>since it takes at least two centuries for a work to get
<div n="lb"/>popular enough to be translated into a foreign language,
<div n="lb"/>the composition must have been done early in the fourth
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. Some believe that the work was done in
<div n="lb"/>Kashmir. While others assert that it was written in
<div n="lb"/>Magadha. The original title of the book is believed to
<div n="lb"/>be ‘Karataka and Damanaka’ by a few.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Two editions.%} Two different editions of the book are
<div n="lb"/>now found. One edition popular in Kashmir is known
<div n="lb"/>as Tantrākhyāyikā. The other is in the form found in
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara and Bṛhatkathāmañjarī. The original
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit work is very rarely found. There are
<div n="lb"/>several editions of this in Dakṣiṇa Bhārata. Changes in
<div n="lb"/>the stories according to the change of times are also
<div n="lb"/>noted. (History of Classical Sanskrit Literature).
<div n="NI"/>B. {%Contents (Stories).%}
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Mitrabheda.%} There was once a very good merchant
<div n="lb"/>in the land of Mahilāropya called Vardhamāna. He
<div n="lb"/>was once travelling in a bullock-cart. One of the
<div n="lb"/>bullocks drawing the cart was named Sañjīvaka. The
<div n="lb"/>leg of Sañjīvaka broke on the way striking against a
<div n="lb"/>stone. Leaving the bullock to the charge of four of his
<div n="lb"/>attendants Vardhamāna continued his journey. When
<div n="lb"/>night came the attendants were frightened by the
<div n="lb"/>surrounding forests and so, leaving the bullock to its
<div n="lb"/>fate the attendants left the place. The bullock got well
<div n="lb"/>and it roamed about in the forests bellowing loudly.
<div n="lb"/>The King of the forests, Piṅgalaka the lion, was
<div n="lb"/>frightened by the bellowing of the bullock.
<div n="NI"/>The lion remained in the forest without stirring out
<div n="lb"/>from its cave. The minister of the lion was a fox. That
<div n="lb"/>fox had two sons named Karaṭaka and Damanaka.
[Page554-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka wanted to know what made the lion worried
<div n="lb"/>and told his brother about it. Karaṭaka advised him
<div n="lb"/>not to interfere unnecessarily with the affairs of others
<div n="lb"/>and told his brother Damanaka a story to stress his
<div n="lb"/>point.
<div n="NI"/>A group of sawers were sawing wood near a temple
<div n="lb"/>for its construction. At lunch time one of the sawers
<div n="lb"/>placed a wedge on a half-sawn timber and went for
<div n="lb"/>his midday meal. One of the monkeys sitting on the
<div n="lb"/>branch of a tree near the temple jumped on to the half-
<div n="lb"/>sawn timber and pulled out the wedge. His tail had
<div n="lb"/>fallen without his knowing into the space between
<div n="lb"/>the sawn planks and when the monkey later jumped
<div n="lb"/>out from the timber his tail was wedged between the
<div n="lb"/>planks and the tail got crushed. If you poke your nose
<div n="lb"/>into the affairs of others without any purpose such
<div n="lb"/>dangers are sure to happen.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that, Damanaka said, “Brother, are we serving
<div n="lb"/>the lion, our master, just for our food? If we want only
<div n="lb"/>our food what difference is there between ourselves and
<div n="lb"/>the dog? Have you not seen the uproar the dogs
<div n="lb"/>make when they see food. A dog has no modesty,
<div n="lb"/>humility or self-confidence. Some men are also like that.
<div n="lb"/>But some others are not like that. Look at the elephant.
<div n="lb"/>It never makes an exhibition of its happiness when it
<div n="lb"/>gets its food. Its majestic stand, look and gestures are
<div n="lb"/>worth noticing. The best of men are also like this.
<div n="lb"/>Everybody should keep this in mind. He who earns his
<div n="lb"/>livelihood without depending on others but does it by
<div n="lb"/>his own wits and efforts is the most revered of men.
<div n="lb"/>But food is not enough, we must earn fame also.
<div n="lb"/>So even though we are children we must try to remove
<div n="lb"/>the worry that hangs over our lord, the lion.”
<div n="lb"/>The brother was not moved by this philosophy of
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka and so he said again, “Anywhere and in any
<div n="lb"/>venture success is difficult to achieve and failure is very
<div n="lb"/>easy. It is difficult to rise up but it is easy to fall down.
<div n="lb"/>It is a very hard labour to roll a stone up a mountain
<div n="lb"/>but to push it down from the top is very easy. He is
<div n="lb"/>blessed who can read correctly the thoughts of other
<div n="lb"/>people. I have, looking at the face of our King, under-
<div n="lb"/>stood that something big is worrying him.”
<div n="NI"/>Karaṭaka said, “Admitting what you say to be correct
<div n="lb"/>how are we to know the thing that worries the King?
<div n="lb"/>It is a dangerous task.” Damanaka said “Regarding the
<div n="lb"/>achievement of success, there are three kinds of people
<div n="lb"/>namely the Uttama (best), the madhyama (mediocre)
<div n="lb"/>and the adhama (worst). The adhama type will never
<div n="lb"/>start a venture fearing failure. The madhyama type
<div n="lb"/>would start his endeavour but would turn back at the
<div n="lb"/>sight of obstacles. But the Uttama type would never
<div n="lb"/>turn back without achieving success. They are the
<div n="lb"/>adorable type of men in this world. The Uttama
<div n="lb"/>would act according to the circumstances of the situa-
<div n="lb"/>tion. If he wants to talk to another and obtain a favour
<div n="lb"/>from him he would not go to him at random without
<div n="lb"/>looking into the time, place and opportunity to do so.
<div n="lb"/>Even Bṛhaspati has his moods. In fact, there is nothing
<div n="lb"/>impossible in this world. Disappointment and failures
<div n="lb"/>are due to want of experience and lack of endeavour.
<div n="lb"/>The great ocean with its huge rolling waves gives one
<div n="lb"/>a fright at first sight. But if he starts bathing in it for
<div n="lb"/>a long time he finds it not so unapproachable or
<div n="lb"/>ghastly.”
<div n="NI"/>When Karaṭaka heard these moral preachings of his
[Page555-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>brother he allowed him to do what he wanted to do.
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka went to the cave of the lion. Far from the
<div n="lb"/>cave itself Damanaka started walking humbly with his
<div n="lb"/>head bent down. The lion saw Damanaka walking
<div n="lb"/>thus to him and was immensely pleased. The King of
<div n="lb"/>the beasts asked him thus “Damanaka, it is a long time
<div n="lb"/>since I saw you and your brother. Why is it that you
<div n="lb"/>both, sons of my minister, do not come and see me as
<div n="lb"/>often as your father?”
<div n="NI"/>Damanaka replied very humbly “Oh mighty King, of
<div n="lb"/>what use can we insignificant creatures be to you? Yet,
<div n="lb"/>if one thinks over it, even little things can also be of use
<div n="lb"/>at times to great people.” Damanaka then recited to the
<div n="lb"/>King a poem which in substance was thus: “Even grass
<div n="lb"/>over which we trample while walking, is of use as fodder
<div n="lb"/>to the cattle. Some are used for cleaning the teeth and
<div n="lb"/>still some, dry and brittle, to tickle the ear when it
<div n="lb"/>itches badly. Great men retain their greatness even
<div n="lb"/>when they fall. A burning torch would send its flame only
<div n="lb"/>upwards even when you keep it upside down. Similarly
<div n="lb"/>all things will shine only in their proper places. An
<div n="lb"/>ornamental waistbelt would not shine round a neck nor
<div n="lb"/>would bangles shine on one's ears. Anyhow let me ask
<div n="lb"/>your highness one question. Is it true that when your
<div n="lb"/>highness went to drink water something happened to
<div n="lb"/>make your highness worry ?”
<div n="NI"/>Piṅgalaka the lion said: “What you say is correct. When
<div n="lb"/>I went today to drink water in the river I heard the
<div n="lb"/>horrifying bellow of a fierce animal and was frightened.
<div n="lb"/>I am thinking of leaving this forest and going to some
<div n="lb"/>other one.”
<div n="NI"/>Damanaka said “Oh Lord, be not frightened. Appear-
<div n="lb"/>ances are often deceptive and cannot be believed. I
<div n="lb"/>shall tell you the story of a fox who mistook an ordinary
<div n="lb"/>drum for an animal with good flesh. Once a fox saw
<div n="lb"/>a drum lying in a battlefield. It was making a sound
<div n="lb"/>when the wind blew over it. The fox mistook it for an
<div n="lb"/>animal with plenty of flesh and blood. Rejoicing at the
<div n="lb"/>prospect of having a hearty meal the fox mustered
<div n="lb"/>courage and went near it. It tore the leather open. Only
<div n="lb"/>then could it understand its blunder.”
<div n="NI"/>The King liked the story very much. So he sent
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka to enquire where the bellow came from.
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka found out Sañjīvaka, the ox and told him
<div n="lb"/>everything and added that he had been sent by the
<div n="lb"/>King to fetch him to his presence. Sañjīvaka was at first
<div n="lb"/>afraid to go but the consoling words of Damanaka
<div n="lb"/>gave him courage and it went to the lion. The lion and
<div n="lb"/>the ox became great friends and gradually the intimacy
<div n="lb"/>developed to such an extent that the King of the beasts
<div n="lb"/>started becoming indifferent to the welfare of the other
<div n="lb"/>beasts in the forest. The subjects of the King Piṅgalaka
<div n="lb"/>were in trouble.
<div n="NI"/>Feeling sorry for his own actions Damanaka went to his
<div n="lb"/>brother and said, “All this happened because of our own
<div n="lb"/>fault. I shall tell you a story about a self-made calamity.
<div n="lb"/>Once an ascetic named Devaśarmā was afraid of
<div n="lb"/>robbers. So he stitched into his robes all the money he
<div n="lb"/>possessed. Somehow a robber named Āṣāḍhabhūti came
<div n="lb"/>to know of it and he made friends with the ascetic and
<div n="lb"/>acted as his servant pretending to be very faithful.
<div n="lb"/>Devaśarmā got confidence in him and one day he went
<div n="lb"/>to bathe handing over all his guarded wealth into the
<div n="lb"/>hands of Āṣāḍhabhūti. On his way back from the river
<div n="lb"/>after his bath Devaśarmā saw two goats fighting against
[Page555-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>each other. Blood was flowing from the heads of both
<div n="lb"/>the goats and still the fight continued. A fox came
<div n="lb"/>there to drink the fresh blood flowing from their heads
<div n="lb"/>and he went and started licking the blood that had
<div n="lb"/>dropped between the two fighting goats. The goats
<div n="lb"/>came again and hit against each other with force and
<div n="lb"/>the fox that was standing between the two and licking
<div n="lb"/>the blood greedily was crushed to death. When he
<div n="lb"/>returned after witnessing the fight the ascetic found
<div n="lb"/>that his servant had gone away with his cash.”
<div n="NI"/>Karaṭaka liked the story very much. They then discuss-
<div n="lb"/>ed ways and means of getting out of this calamity.
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka said that any object can be achieved by
<div n="lb"/>cleverness and told his brother a story to illustrate his
<div n="lb"/>point. He said “Once a crow made his abode on a tree
<div n="lb"/>with his wife and children. After some time his wife
<div n="lb"/>began to lay eggs but all of them disappeared one by
<div n="lb"/>one. They made enquiries and found that the culprit
<div n="lb"/>was a big cobra living beneath the same tree. They
<div n="lb"/>were no match to the cobra and so they sought the
<div n="lb"/>advice of their friend, a fox.
<div n="NI"/>The fox said, “I shall suggest a way to get out of the
<div n="lb"/>danger. Have you not heard the story of an old stork
<div n="lb"/>who got his food by his cleverness? The stork went to
<div n="lb"/>the banks of a pond feeling hungry. There were plenty
<div n="lb"/>of fishes in the pond. The stork stood still on the banks
<div n="lb"/>pretending to be sad. A crab seeing the sad-looking
<div n="lb"/>stork came and enquired the cause of his grief. The
<div n="lb"/>stork said ‘You well know that we storks live on flesh.
<div n="lb"/>and fish. I now understand that a fisherman has planned
<div n="lb"/>to catch all the fish in this pond. This is the cause of
<div n="lb"/>my worry.” The fishes who overheard this conver-
<div n="lb"/>sation between the crab and the stork came before the
<div n="lb"/>stork frightened and requested him to save them from
<div n="lb"/>the fisherman somehow. The stork said ‘I am not strong
<div n="lb"/>to fight the fisherman. But I can do what little help
<div n="lb"/>I can give you. I shall every day remove you one by one
<div n="lb"/>from this pond to another one without the knowledge
<div n="lb"/>of the fisherman.”
<div n="NI"/>The poor fishes agreed to the proposal and the stork
<div n="lb"/>carried away one fish everyday from the pond and ate
<div n="lb"/>it at a place hidden from the view of the others. This
<div n="lb"/>went on for one or two months without break and
<div n="lb"/>somehow the crab got suspicious and he requested the
<div n="lb"/>stork to take him also to the other pond. The stork
<div n="lb"/>carrying the crab reached its usual place and the crab
<div n="lb"/>was horrified at the sight of the bones of the fishes
<div n="lb"/>eaten before by the stork. The crab knew its death
<div n="lb"/>was sure even if it did not fight with the stork and so
<div n="lb"/>started a fight and in the end killed the stork by
<div n="lb"/>crushing the neck of the stork.”
<div n="NI"/>The crows crew hilariously when they heard the
<div n="lb"/>story of the fox. The fox then told them a plan.
<div n="lb"/>“When any of those who come to bathe in a pond near-
<div n="lb"/>by removes the necklace and places it on the shore you
<div n="lb"/>are to pick it up and hang it on a branch of the tree.”
<div n="lb"/>The crows did like that and pedestrians going that way
<div n="lb"/>saw the necklace hanging from the branch and took it
<div n="lb"/>after killing the cobra in the hole beneath the tree.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing the story told by Damanaka the idea of
<div n="lb"/>putting the lion against the ox gained strength in
<div n="lb"/>Karaṭaka's mind. To confirm the idea in his brother's
<div n="lb"/>mind Damanaka told another story. Damanaka said.
<div n="lb"/>“Once there was a lion named Madotkaṭa. He lived
<div n="lb"/>in a forest harassing all the beasts that lived there.
[Page556-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>All the subjects of King Madotkaṭa joined together,
<div n="lb"/>went to him and represented to him that they would
<div n="lb"/>go to his cave one by one every day to be killed and
<div n="lb"/>eaten by him. The lion agreed to that and the beasts
<div n="lb"/>one by one went to his cave each day. One day it was
<div n="lb"/>the turn of a clever hare. The hare walked slowly and
<div n="lb"/>reached the lion's den late. The King was very cross
<div n="lb"/>at this and asked him to explain why he was late. The
<div n="lb"/>hare said “Oh lord, on my way another lion accosted
<div n="lb"/>me and I had to take a round-about route to get away
<div n="lb"/>from that lion.” The lion got angry and asked the
<div n="lb"/>hare to take him to the other lion who dared to come
<div n="lb"/>to that forest and question his authority. The hare
<div n="lb"/>took the lion to a well and asked his lord to peep in.
<div n="lb"/>When Madotkaṭa did so he saw his own reflection in
<div n="lb"/>the still waters of the well and mistook it for another
<div n="lb"/>lion. It jumped into the well and was killed.”
<div n="NI"/>Karaṭaka had implicit confidence in Damanaka after
<div n="lb"/>hearing all these stories and he sent his brother to the
<div n="lb"/>King to create a rupture between the lion and the ox.
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka went to the King Piṅgalaka and apologised
<div n="lb"/>for the mistake he had committed. Then the King
<div n="lb"/>enquired what the mistake was. Damanaka said that
<div n="lb"/>the ox Sañjīvaka was not such a simpleton as he took
<div n="lb"/>him to be. He was ambitious and wanted to snatch
<div n="lb"/>away the kingdom from Piṅgalaka. It was unwise to
<div n="lb"/>keep one single minister always. “After all what can an
<div n="lb"/>ox do? He can plough the fields. I have come to
<div n="lb"/>inform you all these out of my regard for you.”
<div n="lb"/>Damanaka said.
<div n="NI"/>Even after hearing all these, Piṅgalaka did not have
<div n="lb"/>the heart to abandon the ox. Piṅgalaka asked what a
<div n="lb"/>poor bullock could do against a lion. Damanaka then
<div n="lb"/>said that one would come into grief if one believed too
<div n="lb"/>much in any body. “Have you not heard the story of
<div n="lb"/>the louse which believed the bug?” Damanaka asked.
<div n="lb"/>Then he narrated a story. “Mandavisarpiṇī was a
<div n="lb"/>louse which was living happily on the silken bed of a
<div n="lb"/>King. A bug went there and made friends with the
<div n="lb"/>louse. The poor louse believed the bug to be harmless
<div n="lb"/>and allowed it to stay that night with him. The
<div n="lb"/>bug said that it was very greedy to suck the blood of
<div n="lb"/>the King. At night the bug bit the King. The King
<div n="lb"/>woke up and ordered his servants to search for the
<div n="lb"/>thing that bit him. When lights were brought the
<div n="lb"/>clever bug slipped away. The royal servants conduct-
<div n="lb"/>ing the search found out the louse and killed it.”
<div n="NI"/>The lion liked the tale very much and yet was reluc-
<div n="lb"/>tant to dismiss the ox. The lion wanted proof that
<div n="lb"/>the ox was at fault. So Damanaka went straight to the
<div n="lb"/>ox in his house and said “We are all small people.
<div n="lb"/>What does the master do for our welfare? If small
<div n="lb"/>people seek the friendship of big people the small ones
<div n="lb"/>will always suffer.” The ox endorsed the view and told
<div n="lb"/>a story to illustrate the truth. “A lion named Madot-
<div n="lb"/>kaṭa had a tiger, a fox and a crow as his ministers.
<div n="lb"/>When the ministers were once walking in the forest
<div n="lb"/>they saw a camel. They had never seen a camel before
<div n="lb"/>and so they were wonderstruck by the animal. They
<div n="lb"/>went and talked with it and gathered that the curious
<div n="lb"/>animal was a camel which had been carrying loads for
<div n="lb"/>a merchant. It had now escaped from the merchant
<div n="lb"/>because of the heavy work it had to do. The camel
<div n="lb"/>wanted to remain in hiding. The ministers took the
<div n="lb"/>new animal to the lion. The lion liked the camel very
[Page556-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>much and soon they became good and intimate friends.
<div n="lb"/>The intimacy increased and soon the King lost all
<div n="lb"/>interest in his other subjects. At this stage the minis-
<div n="lb"/>ters found out a plan. They advised the King to kill
<div n="lb"/>and eat the camel but the King refused to do so. Then
<div n="lb"/>the crow went before the King and requested the lion
<div n="lb"/>to kill and eat it. But the crow was so small a food for
<div n="lb"/>the lion and so it refused to kill the crow. Then the
<div n="lb"/>fox made a similar offer but the lion refused to kill the
<div n="lb"/>fox also. Then came the tiger with the offer and the
<div n="lb"/>lion refused to kill the tiger also. Seeing all this the
<div n="lb"/>camel also made a similar offer and the moment his
<div n="lb"/>consent was out from his mouth the fox and the tiger
<div n="lb"/>together killed the poor camel and ate it. So one
<div n="lb"/>should be careful in believing others. In my case I
<div n="lb"/>am sure some wicked persons must have advised him
<div n="lb"/>against me and that is the reason why the lion is
<div n="lb"/>angry with me. But I will always work true to my con-
<div n="lb"/>science. There is no harm in fighting either for self-
<div n="lb"/>protection or for destroying one's enemies. So if it is
<div n="lb"/>necessary I will fight the lion.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Damanaka said “To go to war with-
<div n="lb"/>out knowing the strength of the enemy is wrong. Once
<div n="lb"/>upon a time a water-fowl quarrelled with the ocean.
<div n="lb"/>The water-fowl was living happily on the shores of an
<div n="lb"/>ocean with his mate. They ate the worms that lived
<div n="lb"/>on the shores. The she-fowl got pregnant and when it
<div n="lb"/>was time to lay her eggs she asked her mate to show her
<div n="lb"/>a safe place to lay the eggs. The male mate asked her
<div n="lb"/>to lay the eggs on the shore itself. But the she-fowl
<div n="lb"/>said that the waves would carry away the eggs and so
<div n="lb"/>it was not wise to do so. The male fowl assured her that
<div n="lb"/>the ocean was not bold enough to do anything against
<div n="lb"/>his interests. But the she-fowl still hesitated.
<div n="NI"/>Then the male fowl said “I am the nearest relative res-
<div n="lb"/>ponsible for your protection and welfare. If one does not
<div n="lb"/>heed the words of a relative one will fall into danger.
<div n="lb"/>I shall tell you the story of a tortoise which came to
<div n="lb"/>grief by not obeying the instructions of its friends. In
<div n="lb"/>olden times there lived on the banks of a pond a tor-
<div n="lb"/>toise who had two swan-friends in the lake named
<div n="lb"/>Saṅkaṭa and Vikaṭa. Once the lake became empty of
<div n="lb"/>water and the swans decided to go to another lake with
<div n="lb"/>water. They never wanted to part with their friend the
<div n="lb"/>tortoise and so decided to take the tortoise also along
<div n="lb"/>with them. But the tortoise could not fly and so
<div n="lb"/>they found a plan to carry the tortoise to the other lake.
<div n="lb"/>They brought a stick and the tortoise was asked to hang
<div n="lb"/>at the middle of the stick clutching the stick tightly
<div n="lb"/>with its teeth. The swans then took the stick by its
<div n="lb"/>two ends each holding one end in its beak. The swans
<div n="lb"/>gave strict instructions that the tortoise should not open
<div n="lb"/>its mouth and then rose up into the air and flew
<div n="lb"/>towards the other lake. On the way some children saw
<div n="lb"/>the funny sight in the air and so hooted and howled.
<div n="lb"/>The tortoise got angry and abused the children. The
<div n="lb"/>moment it opened its mouth it lost hold on the stick
<div n="lb"/>and fell down to the ground This happened because the
<div n="lb"/>tortoise did not heed the words of its friends.” The
<div n="lb"/>water fowl continued ‘It is cowardice and foolishness to
<div n="lb"/>remain sad expecting dangers in future. Just hear this
<div n="lb"/>story’ he said ‘Once in a pond there were three fishes
<div n="lb"/>named Anāgata, Utpannamati and Yadbhaviṣya. Hear-
<div n="lb"/>ing that fishermen were coming to fish in that pond
<div n="lb"/>Anāgata warned them and suggested going to another
[Page557-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pond to escape from the fishermen. But Utpannamati
<div n="lb"/>and Yadbhaviṣya did not care. They said that some
<div n="lb"/>plan could be found out when the danger came. But
<div n="lb"/>Anāgata felt diffident and so he went away to another
<div n="lb"/>pond. Soon the fishermen came and spread their nets.
<div n="lb"/>Utpannamati lay still pretending to be dead. The
<div n="lb"/>fishermen took it and deposited it on the shore and
<div n="lb"/>started to fish again. The moment the fishermen turned
<div n="lb"/>their heads Utpannamati slipped into a mud pit nearby
<div n="lb"/>and remained there till the departure of the fishermen.
<div n="lb"/>But poor Yadbhaviṣya could not think of any plan and
<div n="lb"/>so was caught and carried away by the fishermen. So
<div n="lb"/>just like Utpannamati I will also come across some plan
<div n="lb"/>when the danger comes and so you do lay your eggs
<div n="lb"/>on the shore of the ocean itself.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the assuring words of her husband the she-
<div n="lb"/>fowl laid her eggs on the shore. But very soon waves
<div n="lb"/>came and carried them away. She complained to her
<div n="lb"/>husband. The water fowl called a conference of all the
<div n="lb"/>birds living there and explained to them his mishap
<div n="lb"/>and all of them went on a deputation to Garuḍa, the
<div n="lb"/>best of the birds and requested him to find out a re-
<div n="lb"/>medy. Garuḍa represented the matter to Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>who in turn called Varuṇa to his side and ordered him
<div n="lb"/>to give back the eggs to the fowl.
<div n="NI"/>After telling this story Damanaka went to the lion and
<div n="lb"/>told him many misleading lies about the ox. Gradually
<div n="lb"/>the lion and the ox became enemies. Damanaka then
<div n="lb"/>triumphantly went and informed his brother Karaṭaka
<div n="lb"/>of his achievement. But Karaṭaka said “Brother, you
<div n="lb"/>have done a very unjust thing. There are four methods
<div n="lb"/>to achieve your object namely, Sāma, Dāna, Bheda
<div n="lb"/>and Daṇḍa. Of these Bheda is to be used only last of
<div n="lb"/>all. I shall tell you a story:
<div n="NI"/>Once a chetty (Merchant) had two sons named Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>buddhi and Duṣṭabuddhi. Once they were both travel-
<div n="lb"/>ling through a forest when Dharmabuddhi got a trea-
<div n="lb"/>sure from a hole at the base of a big tree. Duṣṭabuddhi
<div n="lb"/>advised his brother not to take the treasure to the city
<div n="lb"/>as it was dangerous to do so and made him bury it at
<div n="lb"/>a place beneath the same tree. That night itself
<div n="lb"/>Duṣṭabuddhi went and dug out the treasure and got it
<div n="lb"/>buried in his own room. After some days both of them
<div n="lb"/>went together to see the treasure and found the place
<div n="lb"/>empty of the treasure. They accused each other of
<div n="lb"/>stealing the treasure. Both of them complained to the
<div n="lb"/>King. The King asked them whether they had any
<div n="lb"/>witnesses and they replied that only the tree was there
<div n="lb"/>as a witness. The King decided that both of them should
<div n="lb"/>go beneath the same tree and dip their hands in burning
<div n="lb"/>oil to prove their innocence. Duṣṭabuddhi went to his
<div n="lb"/>father and requested him that he should hide in the
<div n="lb"/>hollow of that tree and say that it was Dharmabuddhi
<div n="lb"/>who had stolen the treasure. Hearing this the father
<div n="lb"/>said “Child, when you think of a trick you must also
<div n="lb"/>think of the danger involved in it. Once there lived a
<div n="lb"/>stork with his wife on a tree. A serpent living in the same
<div n="lb"/>tree began to eat the young ones of the stork and the
<div n="lb"/>stork complained to his friend fox about it. The clever
<div n="lb"/>fox suggested to him a plan. There was a mongoose
<div n="lb"/>living near the tree. The stork was to drop fishes in
<div n="lb"/>front of the hole of the mongoose and continue
<div n="lb"/>dropping fishes in a line leading to the abode of the
<div n="lb"/>serpent. The mongoose would thus be led to the hole
<div n="lb"/>of the serpent. The stork did so and when the mongoose
[Page557-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>reached the hole of the serpent it saw it and killed it.
<div n="lb"/>I cannot do such cruel things.” But when Duṣṭabuddhi
<div n="lb"/>insisted, the father half-heartedly agreed to it and went
<div n="lb"/>and sat in the hollow of the tree. Next day the servants
<div n="lb"/>of the King came to the foot of the tree with burning
<div n="lb"/>oil. They asked the tree to tell the truth regarding
<div n="lb"/>the theft. Then there came a voice from the tree denounc-
<div n="lb"/>ing Dharmabuddhi as the culprit. Dharmabuddhi then
<div n="lb"/>said there was no truth in the bodiless voice and request-
<div n="lb"/>ed them to fumigate the tree from beneath. The royal
<div n="lb"/>servants did so and then the father came out and con-
<div n="lb"/>fessed everything. The servants of the King nailed
<div n="lb"/>Duṣṭabuddhi on a spike and killed him.
<div n="NI"/>After having told the story Karaṭaka tried to dissuade
<div n="lb"/>his brother from his deceitful intentions. Karaṭaka
<div n="lb"/>said:—“Piṅgala and Sañjīvaka are kind-hearted and
<div n="lb"/>simple people. There need be no treachery with them.
<div n="lb"/>Treachery is allowed against wicked people. I shall tell
<div n="lb"/>you the story of a merchant:—
<div n="NI"/>This merchant had as his entire wealth a thousand
<div n="lb"/>pounds of iron and one day he went on a pilgrimage
<div n="lb"/>after entrusting his entire wealth to a friend and
<div n="lb"/>neighbour of his on the understanding that the latter
<div n="lb"/>should return it on his return after the pilgrimage.
<div n="lb"/>After ten months the merchant returned but the friend
<div n="lb"/>did not give back the iron. He regretted that all the
<div n="lb"/>iron was eaten by rats in which his house abounded.
<div n="lb"/>The merchant knew that his neighbour was speaking
<div n="lb"/>falsehood but kept silent over the matter. After a few
<div n="lb"/>days the merchant somehow enticed the only son of his
<div n="lb"/>neighbour to his house and locked the young boy in a
<div n="lb"/>room. The friend went in search of his son to the
<div n="lb"/>merchant's house and asked him whether he had seen
<div n="lb"/>his son anywhere. The merchant replied that he saw
<div n="lb"/>the boy being carried away by a kite. The friend could
<div n="lb"/>not believe the story and suspecting some foul play on
<div n="lb"/>the part of the merchant went to the king and reported
<div n="lb"/>the matter to him. The king sent for the merchant and
<div n="lb"/>asked him about the missing boy. The merchant gave
<div n="lb"/>the king the same reply he gave his friend. The king
<div n="lb"/>was surprised and asked the merchant whether it was
<div n="lb"/>believable that a boy aged eighteen would be carried
<div n="lb"/>away by a kite. The merchant very coolly replied that
<div n="lb"/>such things could happen in a country where rats could
<div n="lb"/>eat a thousand pounds of iron. The king asked the
<div n="lb"/>merchant to explain and he then told him everything
<div n="lb"/>that had happened. The king ordered the friend to
<div n="lb"/>return the iron and the merchant got back his wealth.
<div n="lb"/>Karaṭaka after telling this story added that deceit in
<div n="lb"/>return for deceit was no sin. Damanaka stuck on to
<div n="lb"/>his plan and made the lion and ox fight each other. The
<div n="lb"/>poor ox was killed and the lion became his old self
<div n="lb"/>again.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Suhṛllābha. (Gaining friends).%} Once there lived on
<div n="lb"/>a tree a crow named Laghupatanaka. The crow saw a
<div n="lb"/>hunter coming and spreading a net beneath the tree.
<div n="lb"/>A flock of doves coming that way was caught in the net.
<div n="lb"/>But the doves flew up in a body and the net was
<div n="lb"/>carried from the ground freed of the pegs that held it.
<div n="lb"/>The crow followed them and when they were safely
<div n="lb"/>landed at another place Citragrīva the leader of the
<div n="lb"/>doves, told the crow thus “I shall now show you the
<div n="lb"/>benefit of gaining friends.” Citragrīva and his doves flew
<div n="lb"/>again with the net and landed before the hole of a rat
<div n="lb"/>named Hiraṇyaka. The rat was a friend of Citragrīva.
[Page558-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>On hearing the voice of Citragrīva outside, Hiraṇyaka
<div n="lb"/>came out and felt sorry for the plight of the doves. The
<div n="lb"/>rat pointed out that nobody could oppose fate and
<div n="lb"/>proved it with illustrations. He added:—“Though
<div n="lb"/>elephants and cobras are mightier and fiercer than men,
<div n="lb"/>it is because of fate that they are being controlled by
<div n="lb"/>smaller people than they themselves. Hiraṇyaka cut
<div n="lb"/>to pieces the threads of the net and set the doves free.
<div n="lb"/>Next day the doves flew away to their places. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>the generosity shown by the rat, the crow wanted to
<div n="lb"/>be friendly with the rat. The crow mentioned this to
<div n="lb"/>the rat. But the rat refused to be friendly thinking that
<div n="lb"/>it was a ruse to get him killed for his food. But the
<div n="lb"/>crow promised to be grateful for ever to the rat for
<div n="lb"/>saving the doves which belonged to the community of
<div n="lb"/>birds to which the crow also belonged. But the rat
<div n="lb"/>retorted that gratitude was a quality which was absent
<div n="lb"/>in any living being and generally harm was the reward
<div n="lb"/>for any favour done. The crow was greatly grieved to
<div n="lb"/>hear the words of Hiraṇyaka and told him that he
<div n="lb"/>(crow) would commit suicide if the rat did not take
<div n="lb"/>him as his friend. At last the rat took pity on the
<div n="lb"/>crow and they became friends. Time passed on and then
<div n="lb"/>there broke out a famine in the land. The crow decided
<div n="lb"/>to shift his abode and told the rat about it. He said
<div n="lb"/>he was going to a lake on the banks of which lived a
<div n="lb"/>friend of his, a tortoise. The tortoise, he added, would
<div n="lb"/>fetch for him from the lake plenty of fish to eat. The
<div n="lb"/>rat was also affected by the famine and so he also decid-
<div n="lb"/>ed to accompany the crow. The crow took the rat
<div n="lb"/>in its beak and they both reached the lake where lived
<div n="lb"/>the tortoise named Manthara. The crow introduced
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyaka to the tortoise and the tortoise asked him
<div n="lb"/>the reason why he left his previous abode.
<div n="NI"/>The rat said:—“There was a bhikṣu (one who lives on
<div n="lb"/>alms) named Cūḍākarṇa living in a house in my place.
<div n="lb"/>He used to eat only what was required to maintain
<div n="lb"/>life in him. He would cook his own food and keep the
<div n="lb"/>remains everyday in his kitchen. I used to eat that
<div n="lb"/>food and live. Then one day another Sannyāsin named
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhatsphik (Vīṇākarṇa) came to this house. Every
<div n="lb"/>night Vīṇākarṇa used to read the Purāṇas to Cūdā-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa. Cūḍākarṇa would sit and make a sound on the
<div n="lb"/>bow kept nearby to drive me away. The first time he
<div n="lb"/>did so Vīṇākarṇa who was reading resented the
<div n="lb"/>interrupting sound and asked Cūḍākarṇa why he made
<div n="lb"/>it. He then explained that it was intended to drive
<div n="lb"/>away the rat coming to steal the food. I was forced to
<div n="lb"/>starve and I became lean and weak. Even rivers would
<div n="lb"/>go dry if there are no rains. Only those with wealth
<div n="lb"/>would have friends. Begging is a nuisance to others.
<div n="lb"/>Everywhere it is important to acquire good and faith-
<div n="lb"/>ful friends. When a good man is in danger only good
<div n="lb"/>men rush to help him. When an elephant falls into a
<div n="lb"/>pit it is always another elephant which comes to its
<div n="lb"/>rescue. Therefore I desire to make friends with you.”
<div n="NI"/>All the three, the crow, the rat and the tortoise lived
<div n="lb"/>together happily. Then one day a deer named Citrāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>gada escaping from a hunter came frightened to their
<div n="lb"/>midst and started living with them. One day the deer
<div n="lb"/>which went in search of food did not return even after
<div n="lb"/>dusk and so the crow went in search of the deer and
<div n="lb"/>found it trapped in a hunter's net. The crow informed
<div n="lb"/>the rat about it and the rat immediately came and
<div n="lb"/>started gnawing at the strings of the net. In the mean-
[Page558-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>time the tortoise desirous of knowing the plight of
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada crawled to the place of accident. The rat
<div n="lb"/>had already torn to pieces the net and the crow and
<div n="lb"/>the rat said that it was unwise of Manthara to have
<div n="lb"/>come so far crawling as there was danger from the
<div n="lb"/>hunter coming to the place soon. Before the deer
<div n="lb"/>could endorse the views of his friends the hunter came
<div n="lb"/>to the scene. The deer, the crow and the rat escaped.
<div n="lb"/>The hunter saw the crawling tortoise and caught it.
<div n="lb"/>Binding it with a string the hunter placed it on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. In the meantime the friends of Manthara who
<div n="lb"/>had escaped hit upon a plan to rescue the tortoise.
<div n="lb"/>The deer lay down pretending to be dead at a place
<div n="lb"/>far away from the place but within the sight of the
<div n="lb"/>hunter. The crow sat perched on its body as if pecking
<div n="lb"/>at its flesh. The hunter saw it and went to take the
<div n="lb"/>dead body of the deer. The moment the hunter turned
<div n="lb"/>away from the tortoise the rat went and cut the string
<div n="lb"/>binding the tortoise and set it free. Before the hunter
<div n="lb"/>reached the deer it ran away. So all were saved. This
<div n="lb"/>is the benefit of having good friends.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sandhivigraha (Peace and war).%} We must make
<div n="lb"/>friends with people only after knowing them well
<div n="lb"/>There was once a big banyan tree in a forest which
<div n="lb"/>was inhabited by many crows. Their leader was a
<div n="lb"/>crow named Meghavarṇa About three kilometres away
<div n="lb"/>from this tree was another banyan tree on which lived
<div n="lb"/>a number of owls. Their leader was an owl named
<div n="lb"/>Amardana. The crows and the owls were great
<div n="lb"/>enemies.
<div n="NI"/>One day Amardana king of the owls with a large army
<div n="lb"/>of a lakh of his subjects attacked the crows at night.
<div n="lb"/>The crows could not see at night and so all the crows
<div n="lb"/>excepting a few of the top ones were killed. Megha-
<div n="lb"/>varṇa, the king, and his ministers, Uddīpaka, Sandīpaka,
<div n="lb"/>Anudīpaka and Cirañjīvī and a few other subjects were
<div n="lb"/>the only ones who escaped from there somehow. They
<div n="lb"/>sat in council at a place and thought of the ways and
<div n="lb"/>means to wreak vengeance on the owls. Uddīpaka said
<div n="lb"/>that when the strength of the enemy was great it was
<div n="lb"/>advisable to move away to another place, or to seek
<div n="lb"/>the aid of mighty people or to surrender to the enemy.
<div n="lb"/>It was the nature of dogs to leave one's place and go
<div n="lb"/>to another place, Sandīpaka said. Others also were
<div n="lb"/>of the same opinion. Cirañjīvī alone did not express
<div n="lb"/>any opinion and so the king asked him why he was
<div n="lb"/>sitting silent.
<div n="NI"/>Cirañjīvī said:—“Oh King, we became enemies of
<div n="lb"/>the owls because of our bad tongue. I shall tell you
<div n="lb"/>the story of an ass which met with its death because of its
<div n="lb"/>bad words. Once a washerman had a donkey to carry
<div n="lb"/>his load of clothes to and fro. The poor washerman
<div n="lb"/>did not have sufficient earnings to feed the donkey well
<div n="lb"/>and so he let it loose to go and eat of its own accord to
<div n="lb"/>appease its hunger. The donkey started going to the
<div n="lb"/>fields of other people and eating their grains. People
<div n="lb"/>started hurting the donkey and so the washerman did a
<div n="lb"/>clever thing. He covered the donkey with the hide of
<div n="lb"/>a tiger and let it loose. People mistook it for a tiger
<div n="lb"/>and did not dare to go near and hurt it. Then one day
<div n="lb"/>a farmer keeping watch over the fields at night felt
<div n="lb"/>suspicious of the fake tiger and covering himself with a
<div n="lb"/>blanket and with a bow and arrow in his hand stealthi-
<div n="lb"/>ly approached the donkey. The poor donkey mistook
<div n="lb"/>the farmer for a she-donkey and brayed and approached
[Page559-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>him with amorous movements of its body. The farmer
<div n="lb"/>knew from its voice that it was a donkey and so
<div n="lb"/>removed his disguise and stood before the donkey. The
<div n="lb"/>be-fooled donkey got angry and abused the farmer
<div n="lb"/>using very vulgar language. The farmer got angry and
<div n="lb"/>killed him with an arrow.
<div n="NI"/>Cirañjīvī continued:—Once upon a time a few birds
<div n="lb"/>joined together and decided to elect their leader. The
<div n="lb"/>owl was the bird selected to lead them. An aged crow
<div n="lb"/>condemned it. The crow said; “Are you making this
<div n="lb"/>ugly bird which is blind all day your leader? If only
<div n="lb"/>you make a worthy creature your leader you will be
<div n="lb"/>respected. I shall tell you a story to illustrate my
<div n="lb"/>point.” He then narrated the following story:
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time there came a period of twelve
<div n="lb"/>continuous years without any rain at all on the earth.
<div n="lb"/>Wells, ponds, lakes and rivers were all empty. A huge
<div n="lb"/>herd of elephants walking in the forests represented to
<div n="lb"/>its leader the grave situation and the leader sent
<div n="lb"/>messengers to all sides to find out watering places with
<div n="lb"/>water. One of the messengers came back and reported
<div n="lb"/>that he had found out a beautiful lake full of water and
<div n="lb"/>that on its banks lived a number of hares. The elephants
<div n="lb"/>immediately went to that place and started enjoying
<div n="lb"/>swimming and bathing in the waters of the lake.
<div n="lb"/>Many rabbits on the bank of the lake died when trodden
<div n="lb"/>upon by the elephants. The aggrieved rabbits sat in
<div n="lb"/>a council to consider the steps to be taken to stop this
<div n="lb"/>deadly nuisance of the elephants. One of the hares,
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya by name, promised to handle the matter by
<div n="lb"/>himself. He knew it would be unwise to go anywhere
<div n="lb"/>near the elephants. So Vijaya climbed on to the top
<div n="lb"/>of a hill near the lake and when he saw the elephants
<div n="lb"/>coming to the lake as usual hailed them from the top
<div n="lb"/>of the hillock. When the elephants turned their heads
<div n="lb"/>to the place from where the sound came they saw a
<div n="lb"/>hare speaking to them. The hare bawled out thus: “We
<div n="lb"/>are all servants of Candra, the moon-god. This lake
<div n="lb"/>has been given to us by him. Candra Bhagavān has
<div n="lb"/>deputed me to verify a report which has reached him
<div n="lb"/>that some elephants are making the water of the lake
<div n="lb"/>muddy. He will surely be cross with you if you again
<div n="lb"/>enter the lake. So it is better for you to go away from
<div n="lb"/>this place.” The elephants were frightened and they
<div n="lb"/>all left the place. Cirañjīvī added that this happened
<div n="lb"/>to the elephants because of the lack of a wise and
<div n="lb"/>proper leader.
<div n="NI"/>The aged Cirañjīvī continued: “It is unwise to place
<div n="lb"/>confidence in small people. I had an experience. Near
<div n="lb"/>my abode on a tree there lived a bird called Kapiñjala.
<div n="lb"/>We became friends. One day Kapiñjala did not come
<div n="lb"/>home as usual. Taking advantage of it a rabbit came
<div n="lb"/>to Kapiñjala's abode and started living there. I did not
<div n="lb"/>like it and I told the rabbit about it. But the rabbit
<div n="lb"/>did not mind it. After four or five days Kapiñjala
<div n="lb"/>returned home and on finding a rabbit in his nest got
<div n="lb"/>angry and asked him to leave the place. The rabbit
<div n="lb"/>refused to go and an argument ensued. The rabbit said
<div n="lb"/>that lakes, rivers and trees were for all and did not
<div n="lb"/>belong to any particular individual. “He who is in
<div n="lb"/>possession of it is its owner,” the rabbit argued. So they
<div n="lb"/>decided to take the case for arbitration and for that
<div n="lb"/>purpose approached a cat named Dadhikarṇa doing
<div n="lb"/>penance on the banks of the river Yamunā, I followed
[Page559-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>them curious to know the decision of the ascetic cat.
<div n="lb"/>They did not see me. Both of them on approaching
<div n="lb"/>him started presenting their case before the cat. The
<div n="lb"/>cat pretended to be deaf and asked both of them to
<div n="lb"/>come nearer and talk into his ears. They moved
<div n="lb"/>nearer and the cat caught hold of them both and ate
<div n="lb"/>them. Those poor beings lost their lives by placing too
<div n="lb"/>much confidence in the aged cat. That is why I say
<div n="lb"/>that we should not select a small being like an owl as
<div n="lb"/>our leader.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing the story of the crow the birds withdrew
<div n="lb"/>from their first decision of selecting an owl as their
<div n="lb"/>leader. The owl was offended and felt insulted and
<div n="lb"/>roared that his community would one day wreak
<div n="lb"/>vengeance on the crows. A wound made by an arrow
<div n="lb"/>would heal in due course and a tree would grow even
<div n="lb"/>if its branches are cut but any wound on the pride of
<div n="lb"/>an individual is never healed.
<div n="NI"/>Cirañjīvī continued:—“This is how the crows and owls
<div n="lb"/>became enemies. We have to fight the owls. It is im-
<div n="lb"/>possible to serve mean people. I shall tell you a story
<div n="lb"/>of what would happen if one believes in mean people:—
<div n="lb"/>Once a brahmin decided to perform a Yāga to increase
<div n="lb"/>the prosperity of the land.
<div n="NI"/>He wanted a goat for the same and some
<div n="lb"/>wicked young people knew that he was going to buy
<div n="lb"/>one. They worked out a plan to deceive the poor
<div n="lb"/>brahmin. They sat hiding at different places on the way
<div n="lb"/>the brahmin was returning with the goat. As he came near
<div n="lb"/>the first of the wicked young men accosted the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>and asked him where he was taking the dog. The
<div n="lb"/>brahmin was surprised that the young man mistook his
<div n="lb"/>goat for dog and went his way. When he walked some
<div n="lb"/>distance more the second of the group came to him and
<div n="lb"/>put the same question. This time the brahmin was a
<div n="lb"/>bit perplexed that two people should have put the same
<div n="lb"/>question which he thought was absurd. When a third
<div n="lb"/>man put this question again he became worried and
<div n="lb"/>when this same question was repeated two more times
<div n="lb"/>the brahmin got mad and left the goat on the road and
<div n="lb"/>went his way. The wicked youngsters took the goat
<div n="lb"/>cooked it and ate it.
<div n="NI"/>After narrating several such stories and maxims Cirañ-
<div n="lb"/>jīvī said he would lead the owls into a trap and come
<div n="lb"/>back. Cirañjīvī then went to the owls and their friends
<div n="lb"/>on the top of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.
<div n="NI"/>Cirañjīvī shaved his head and smearing the blood of the
<div n="lb"/>dead crows on his body went and sat alone on a branch
<div n="lb"/>of their former abode, the banyan tree. When night
<div n="lb"/>came the owls came and surrounded the tree. Cirañjīvī
<div n="lb"/>made some pitiable groans and the owls took him before
<div n="lb"/>their king. The king questioned Cirañjīvī and he said
<div n="lb"/>thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“I am Cirañjīvī the minister of Meghavarṇa. Once
<div n="lb"/>I praised your greatness before my king and he
<div n="lb"/>shaved my head and dismissed me from his service.” The
<div n="lb"/>king of the owls asked his ministers what should be
<div n="lb"/>done with Cirañjīvī. The minister of the king of
<div n="lb"/>owls, Baka, immediately jumped from his seat and said:
<div n="NI"/>“Once a fox went to steal the cow of a brahmin. On his
<div n="lb"/>way he met a Brahmarākṣasa and they became friends.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmarākṣasa was going to kill and eat the brah-
<div n="lb"/>min. Both exchanged their ideas and when they reached
<div n="lb"/>the gate of the house of the brahmin the fox said he
[Page560-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>would go first and eat the goat. But the Brahmarākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>said he would enter first and eat the brahmin. The
<div n="lb"/>quarrel developed into a noisy one and hearing the
<div n="lb"/>sound outside the brahmin came out. The fox accused
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmarākṣasa of having come to eat the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>while the Brahmarākṣasa accused the fox of having
<div n="lb"/>come to eat the goat. The brahmin was glad that he
<div n="lb"/>escaped from a danger and pardoning them sent them
<div n="lb"/>both with presents. This is the benefit of a split
<div n="lb"/>among the enemies.
<div n="NI"/>The king of the owls gave refuge to Cirañjīvī and the
<div n="lb"/>latter expressing gratitude for the favour done took a
<div n="lb"/>vow that he would wreak vengeance on the crows after
<div n="lb"/>getting himself born as an owl in his next birth. At
<div n="lb"/>once the king said “Oh Cirañjīvī, it is not wise to
<div n="lb"/>change one's clan. Once a kite picked up a girl rat and
<div n="lb"/>flew up. On the way the young rat slipped from the
<div n="lb"/>beak of the kite and fell down into the open palm of a
<div n="lb"/>sage doing his sandhyāvandana. The sage by his yogic
<div n="lb"/>powers made it into a beautiful girl and presented her
<div n="lb"/>to his wife. The girl attained womanhood and the sage
<div n="lb"/>was anxious to get her married to a suitable person.
<div n="lb"/>He first approached the Sun and the Sun replied “You
<div n="lb"/>are in search of a powerful husband. Megha (cloud) is
<div n="lb"/>more powerful than myself since at any time it can cast
<div n="lb"/>a shadow over my brilliance. So go and ask Megha
<div n="lb"/>about this.” The sage went to Megha and Megha said
<div n="lb"/>that wind which could carry him away at his will was
<div n="lb"/>more powerful than himself and so directed him to the
<div n="lb"/>wind. The sage approached the wind and it said that
<div n="lb"/>the mountain which could obstruct its path was more
<div n="lb"/>powerful and so the sage went to the mountain. The
<div n="lb"/>mountain said that the rat which could make holes in him
<div n="lb"/>was more powerful and so finally the sage went to the
<div n="lb"/>rat. The rat agreed to marry her but asked how it could
<div n="lb"/>keep her in the hole which was his abode. The sage said
<div n="lb"/>that it was easy and changed her into a rat. This is
<div n="lb"/>how a girl rat became a girl rat again. So do not change
<div n="lb"/>your clan, be a crow and live with me.”
<div n="NI"/>Cirañjīvī from that day onwards started living with the
<div n="lb"/>owls. During day time when the owls slept, the old crow
<div n="lb"/>would fly hither and thither and collect such easily
<div n="lb"/>combustible materials as hay, dry grass and cotton and
<div n="lb"/>stock them beneath the tree covered with dry leaves.
<div n="lb"/>Two months went by like this and one day when the
<div n="lb"/>owls were sleeping Cirañjīvī set fire to the stock of dry
<div n="lb"/>materials beneath the tree. The owls were all burnt to
<div n="lb"/>death. Meghavarṇa and his friends congratulated Cir-
<div n="lb"/>añjīvī on his success. Cirañjīvī said: To obtain difficult
<div n="lb"/>positions great men pass through difficult situations. If
<div n="lb"/>one is prepared to suffer hardships any object can be
<div n="lb"/>achieved. Once a cobra began to starve for want of food.
<div n="lb"/>It went to the land of frogs and told the king of frogs
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Friend, I am in difficulties. I happened to bite
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin boy and that boy died. The boy's father cursed
<div n="lb"/>me. I asked for forgiveness and then he said:—“You
<div n="lb"/>must carry your enemies, the frogs, on your back from
<div n="lb"/>one pond to another pond and live on the food they
<div n="lb"/>give you.” The king of the frogs believed him and
<div n="lb"/>allowed his subjects to be carried away to another pond
<div n="lb"/>from the one in which they were then staying. The
<div n="lb"/>cobra ate all the frogs on the way and at last the king
<div n="lb"/>also was eaten. Thus to destroy the enemies one will
<div n="lb"/>have to carry them on one's backs sometimes. The crows
<div n="lb"/>were happy their enemies the owls were destroyed and
[Page560-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>they lived more happily and peacefully than before.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Labdhanāśa.. (Losing what you got).%} Once a monkey
<div n="lb"/>named Balīmukha separated himself from his group and
<div n="lb"/>came to a fig tree on the banks of a river. When he
<div n="lb"/>jumped from branch to branch on the tree a great many
<div n="lb"/>ripe figs fell into the river. Seeing this a crocodile
<div n="lb"/>named Śiṃśumāra came to the foot of the tree and
<div n="lb"/>started eating the fruits. This went on for a few days
<div n="lb"/>and then the crocodile and the monkey became good
<div n="lb"/>friends. One day the crocodile sat chatting with the
<div n="lb"/>monkey and eating fruits and did not go home. The
<div n="lb"/>wife of the crocodile got worried on not seeing her
<div n="lb"/>husband back at home and sent a maid of hers to
<div n="lb"/>go and enquire what happened to her husband. The
<div n="lb"/>maid came and reported that the crocodile was spending
<div n="lb"/>his time with a she-monkey. The wife of the crocodile
<div n="lb"/>was very sad and angry to hear this and she sent word
<div n="lb"/>through her maid that she was seriously ill and if he
<div n="lb"/>wanted to see her alive he must return to her immed-
<div n="lb"/>iately. The crocodile returned home immediately and
<div n="lb"/>he called a doctor to examine her. The doctor who had
<div n="lb"/>been previously bribed by the crocodile's wife said that
<div n="lb"/>she should be given the heart of a monkey if she were
<div n="lb"/>to be saved from her present ailment. The crocodile was
<div n="lb"/>in a fix. He weighed in his mind the lives of his wife
<div n="lb"/>and friend and then decided to take the life of his friend
<div n="lb"/>to save the life of his wife. The crocodile went to its
<div n="lb"/>place near the fig tree as usual and the monkey made
<div n="lb"/>enquiries about his family. Then Śiṃśumāra said that his
<div n="lb"/>wife wanted to see the monkey-friend and had asked him
<div n="lb"/>to take him home that day. The monkey believed the
<div n="lb"/>story and started for the house of Śiṃśumāra on its
<div n="lb"/>back. When they reached half way in the river Śiṃśu-
<div n="lb"/>māra told Balīmukha thus: “My wife is seriously ill.
<div n="lb"/>The doctor has prescribed the heart of a monkey as the
<div n="lb"/>only medicine for it.” The monkey went pale-white with
<div n="lb"/>fright but instantly he hit upon a plan. Balīmukha said
<div n="lb"/>“Śiṃśumāra, what a fool you are. Why did you not
<div n="lb"/>tell me this at least at the time of our departure? I kept
<div n="lb"/>my heart on the tree before starting, for I never knew
<div n="lb"/>you were in need of it. Let us go back and take it.”
<div n="lb"/>The poor crocodile believed the story and went back
<div n="lb"/>with the monkey to the fig tree. As soon as they reach-
<div n="lb"/>ed the shore the monkey jumped from the back
<div n="lb"/>of the crocodile and ran to the tree. The crocodile
<div n="lb"/>asked the monkey to bring his heart soon but the
<div n="lb"/>monkey laughed from the top of the fig tree and said
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“Dull-witted crocodile, I am not an ass like
<div n="lb"/>you. Have you not heard the story of the foolish ass?”
<div n="lb"/>The monkey then narrated the story of the ass thus:—
<div n="lb"/>“Once a lion calling his minister, the fox, to his side said
<div n="lb"/>that he wanted to eat the flesh of an ass as a remedy
<div n="lb"/>for the stomach trouble he was having by drinking too
<div n="lb"/>much of elephant's blood. The minister started in search
<div n="lb"/>of an ass and found one in the house of a washerman.
<div n="lb"/>The fox said that he was surprised that the ass was do-
<div n="lb"/>ing such heavy work daily with a washerman when a
<div n="lb"/>happy life in the palace of the lion was easily available.
<div n="lb"/>The ass was tempted and it went to the den of the lion.
<div n="lb"/>When it reached there it got frightened and taking the
<div n="lb"/>opportunity of the absence of the lion for his evening
<div n="lb"/>worship left the place in a hurry. The lion sent the fox
<div n="lb"/>again to fetch the ass. The fox came and laughed at
<div n="lb"/>the timidity of the ass. He said that the lion was of a
<div n="lb"/>loving nature and last time when it approached the ass
[Page561-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>to embrace him out of affection he ran away like a fool.
<div n="lb"/>The lion knew that the asses were as a class good music-
<div n="lb"/>ians and the lion himself a great lover of music was
<div n="lb"/>anxious to hear the ass sing. The poor ass believed the
<div n="lb"/>story and went to the lion along with the fox When
<div n="lb"/>the ass reached the lion's den the lion was waiting for
<div n="lb"/>him and the ass in all simplicity bowed before the lion.
<div n="lb"/>The lion with one stroke killed the poor beast and leav-
<div n="lb"/>ing the carcass to the care of the fox went for his
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyāvandana. When the lion returned the fox had
<div n="lb"/>already eaten the heart of the ass. The King of the
<div n="lb"/>beasts not finding the heart in its place questioned
<div n="lb"/>the fox and the fox replied that the asses do not possess
<div n="lb"/>either a heart or neck:
<div n="NI"/>When the monkey concluded his story by adding that
<div n="lb"/>never again would he be trapped like this, Śiṃśumāra,
<div n="lb"/>the crocodile, went its way. Labdhanāśa is the act of
<div n="lb"/>losing what came into your possession once.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Asamprekṣyakārita.%} This is a tale which explains
<div n="lb"/>the danger behind doing things adventurously without
<div n="lb"/>properly studying the pros and cons of an issue.
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time there lived in Gauḍadeśa a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Devaśarmā. His wife Yajñasenā became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant. The father started saying that the son to be
<div n="lb"/>born would be a very fortunate boy. One day the
<div n="lb"/>wife of the brahmin told him thus:—“It is not good to
<div n="lb"/>build castles in the air. Once a brahmacārī walked
<div n="lb"/>home carrying the fried grain he got as his dakṣiṇā in
<div n="lb"/>a pot on his head. He started thinking thus—“I will
<div n="lb"/>sell this fried grain and with the money will buy a
<div n="lb"/>lamb. The lamb will grow and give birth to two kids.
<div n="lb"/>I will then sell the goat and the kids and buy a cow.
<div n="lb"/>The cow will give birth to calves in a short time. I
<div n="lb"/>will buy some land to raise paddy. After selling the
<div n="lb"/>paddy I will renovate my old house and then I will
<div n="lb"/>marry. She will deliver a beautiful son. I will name
<div n="lb"/>the child Somaśarmā. At times leaving the child
<div n="lb"/>alone my wife will go to milk the cow and then I will
<div n="lb"/>hit her like this.” So saying the brahmacārī hit with his
<div n="lb"/>stick the mud pot on his head containing the fried
<div n="lb"/>grain. The pot broke and the whole thing inside fell on
<div n="lb"/>the road.
<div n="NI"/>Devaśarmā on hearing the story of Yajñasenā became
<div n="lb"/>pensive. After five or six days Yajñasenā delivered a
<div n="lb"/>son. Days went by and one morning Yajñasenā went
<div n="lb"/>for her bath in the river nearby entrusting the child to
<div n="lb"/>the care of her husband. Some moments later a
<div n="lb"/>messenger came from the palace asking him to go over
<div n="lb"/>there. The brahmin was in a fix. There was nobody
<div n="lb"/>around to whose care he could leave the child. He
<div n="lb"/>had a mongoose. The brahmin asked the mongoose to
<div n="lb"/>look after the child and went to the palace. Some
<div n="lb"/>time later a big cobra came creeping towards the
<div n="lb"/>child. The mongoose jumped at it and killed it.
<div n="lb"/>The mongoose was smeared with blood after that. The
<div n="lb"/>brahmin returned hurriedly from the palace only to
<div n="lb"/>see the blood-smeared mongoose waiting at the door-
<div n="lb"/>step. Thinking that the mongoose must have killed
<div n="lb"/>his son the brahmin thrashed the poor mongoose to
<div n="lb"/>death. But on entering the room the brahmin found
<div n="lb"/>out his mistake, for there near the child was the dead
<div n="lb"/>body of a deadly cobra. The brahmin regretted his
<div n="lb"/>foolish act of doing a deed before knowing things well,
<div n="lb"/>when Yajñasenā came back after her bath and was
[Page561-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>greatly disturbed by the foolish deed of her husband.
<div n="lb"/>She said:—“Once there was in a place a very poor
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy. He was an orphan with nobody to help
<div n="lb"/>him and he suffered from hunger daily. One night
<div n="lb"/>the boy had a dream. He was told that at midday
<div n="lb"/>next day three beggars would come to his place and
<div n="lb"/>if he slew them they would turn themselves into trea-
<div n="lb"/>sure jars and that the boy could become rich by
<div n="lb"/>using the wealth so received. Next day the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>boy was having his head shaved when as predicted in
<div n="lb"/>the dream three beggars entered his house. The
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy ran away from the barber and taking a
<div n="lb"/>stick thrashed the three to death. All the three turned
<div n="lb"/>into treasure jars. The barber was astonished. The
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy gave the barber a sovereign taken from
<div n="lb"/>the jar as his wages. The barber thought that beggars
<div n="lb"/>would turn themselves into treasure jars if they were
<div n="lb"/>thrashed to death. So he waited daily in his house
<div n="lb"/>for beggars to enter his house. One day after a long
<div n="lb"/>waiting three beggars entered his house and the barber
<div n="lb"/>with a hard stick which he had kept ready started
<div n="lb"/>thrashing the beggars. The beggars shrieked and
<div n="lb"/>shouted and ran away abusing the barber. Servants of
<div n="lb"/>the King came on hearing this and took the barber
<div n="lb"/>away and by the command of the King killed him
<div n="lb"/>nailing him on to a spike. Yajñasenā concluded by
<div n="lb"/>saying that even death would be the result if one does
<div n="lb"/>anything without properly understanding things.
