CATURUPĀYAM¦. The four means used by Kings in
<div n="lb"/>olden times to achieve their objects are called Caturu-
<div n="lb"/>pāyam. Sāma, dāna, bheda and daṇḍa are the Catur-
<div n="lb"/>upāyas (four tactics). There are three other upāyas
<div n="lb"/>also, almost equally important as the first four, and the
<div n="lb"/>seven upāyas are collectively called Saptopāyas. There
<div n="lb"/>are also yet other upāyas, but they are not important
<div n="lb"/>enough to merit special mention.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Sāma.%} It is the best means to attract and convert
<div n="lb"/>others to one's side. It consists in winning people with
<div n="lb"/>sweet words and looks. People who are friendly by
<div n="lb"/>temperament and straightforward may be brought
<div n="lb"/>round by sāma. Sāma is employed in dealing with sons,
<div n="lb"/>brothers and other relatives.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Dāna.%} There are five kinds or varieties of dāna
<div n="lb"/>(gift) viz. prītidāna, dravyadāna, svayaṃgrāha, deya
<div n="lb"/>and pratimokṣa. If a person gets help from another
<div n="lb"/>and acknowledges help by reward that reward is
<div n="lb"/>called prītidāna. The miser and the poor should be
<div n="lb"/>brought round by prītidāna. Military captains, heroes
<div n="lb"/>and citizens should be won over by this dāna. Those
<div n="lb"/>who fall at feet should be honoured by dāna.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bheda.%} Bhedopāya is of three kinds: to destroy or
<div n="lb"/>end the friendship subsisting between people, to create
<div n="lb"/>dissension and to make the parties quarrel with each
<div n="lb"/>other. He who is falsely praised, he who does not desire
<div n="lb"/>wealth or welfare, he who has been invited to come and
<div n="lb"/>then insulted, traitor to king, he who has been exorbi-
<div n="lb"/>tantly taxed, the angry one, the honourable one, the
<div n="lb"/>insulted, the unreasonably forsaken one, he who har-
<div n="lb"/>bours hatred in his mind, the pacified one, one whose
<div n="lb"/>wealth and wife have been taken away or stolen, he
<div n="lb"/>who has not been respected though deserving of respect—
<div n="lb"/>if such people are in one's opposite camp, suspicion
<div n="lb"/>should be raked up among them and thus division crea-
<div n="lb"/>ted in their ranks. If subordinate chieftains, and forest
<div n="lb"/>tribes commit offences they should be brought round
<div n="lb"/>by the use of sāma and bheda upāyas.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Daṇḍa.%} Daṇḍopāya is of three kinds, viz, killing,
<div n="lb"/>denuding of wealth, and inflicting pain on the body or
<div n="lb"/>torture. Daṇḍa has two other forms, prakāśa (open)
<div n="lb"/>and aprakāśa (secret). Those who have become objects
<div n="lb"/>of hatred to all people should be subjected to prakāśa-
<div n="lb"/>daṇḍa. People, whose killing the world will detest,
<div n="lb"/>should not be killed openly, but only secretly. Enemies
<div n="lb"/>should be killed with weapons etc. Brahmins should not
<div n="lb"/>be killed. Friends and allies should not be subjected
<div n="lb"/>to daṇḍa; friends, who are made objects of daṇḍa will
<div n="lb"/>wither away like worm-eaten trees. The King, who
<div n="lb"/>possesses the three powers (of wealth, army and people's
<div n="lb"/>support) and is fully conscious of the time and environ-
<div n="lb"/>mental factors should annihilate enemies by the instru-
<div n="lb"/>ment of daṇḍa. Evil people should be defeated by
<div n="lb"/>daṇḍa itself.
<div n="NI"/>The upāya māyā consists in practising deception by
<div n="lb"/>magic or other yogic powers. The powers can be
<div n="lb"/>acquired by the worship of the idols of certain Devatās.
<div n="lb"/>People who employ go about at night in various dis-
<div n="lb"/>guises. They disguise themselves as beautiful women or
<div n="lb"/>even as animals. They also deceive people by creating
<div n="lb"/>illusions of clouds, fire or lightning. For instance, Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>killed Kīcaka by going to him in the guise of a woman.

<div n="lb"/>Not to dissuade people who indulge in unjustifiable
<div n="lb"/>grief, war etc. is the principal aim of the upāya called
<div n="lb"/>upekṣā. Hiḍimbī gave up his brother Hidimba by
<div n="lb"/>practising Upekṣā. Next is the Indrajālopāya (magic).
<div n="lb"/>For example, to create illusions of clouds, darkness, rain,
<div n="lb"/>fire, and other magic in order to instil fear among
<div n="lb"/>troops of the enemy etc. To scare the enemy is the aim
<div n="lb"/>of Indrajāla. (For details of Caturupāyas see Kaṇika).
