MĀYĀŚIVA¦. Padma Purāṇa gives a story of how once an
<div n="lb"/>asura named Jalandhara approached Pārvatī as Śiva to
<div n="lb"/>induce her to surrender to his desires. This Śiva was
<div n="lb"/>called Māyāśiva.
<div n="NI"/>A great battle between the devas and asuras was going
<div n="lb"/>on. The asuras were winning and the devas got frighten-
<div n="lb"/>ed at the strength of the asuras and so Śiva himself
<div n="lb"/>entered the battlefield. Jalandhara who led the army of
[Page497-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the asuras found the fight against Śiva very tough and
<div n="lb"/>smelt defeat. He decided to cheat Pārvatī, the consort
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva, to compensate for his defeat in the battle-field
<div n="lb"/>and so making an asura named Śumbha as the chief,
<div n="lb"/>he left for Kailāsa. Śumbha became a māyā Jalandhara
<div n="lb"/>and continued the fight.
<div n="NI"/>Taking another asura named Durvāraṇa, Jalandhara
<div n="lb"/>went to a cave in Kailāsa and there changed himself
<div n="lb"/>into an exact replica of Śiva. He made Durvāraṇa look
<div n="lb"/>like Nandikeśa.
<div n="NI"/>Then they went to the top of the mountain where Pār-
<div n="lb"/>vatī and her companions were staying. Śiva approached
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī on the shoulders of Nandikeśa with wounds all
<div n="lb"/>over his body and blood oozing from them. Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>seeing Śiva thus, with tears rolling down her cheeks
<div n="lb"/>asked him, “Oh, Lord of the gods what happened to
<div n="lb"/>your lordship? Who defeated you in the battle? Why
<div n="lb"/>do you weep like a low-bred man?” Māyāśiva took
<div n="lb"/>from his body all his ornaments like Vāsuki and gave
<div n="lb"/>them to the companions of Pārvatī. When Pārvatī saw
<div n="lb"/>the heads of Gaṇapati and Subrahmaṇya in the hands
<div n="lb"/>of her husband she cried in bitterness. Śiva told her
<div n="lb"/>that all his pārṣadas like Maṇibhadra, Vīrabhadra,
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta, Damana, Dhūmatāmra and Kūṣmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>were killed in the battle. Caṇḍī, Bhṛṅgī, Kirīṭī, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>kāla, Śṛṅkhalī, Caṇḍīśa and Guptanetra were all killed.
<div n="lb"/>Māyāśiva told her that he had picked up the heads of
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati and Subrahmaṇya found lying in the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field. He requested Pārvatī to console him by embracing
<div n="lb"/>him. Pārvatī resented the request. She said, “What
<div n="lb"/>you say is unfit for the situation. Sexual enjoyment is
<div n="lb"/>forbidden in times of misery, fear, meditation, vomiting
<div n="lb"/>fever, performing offering to the manes, journey, royal
<div n="lb"/>visits, marriage festivities and in the presence of elders
<div n="lb"/>and teachers. Why do you make this request to me
<div n="lb"/>when I am mourning the death of my sons?
<div n="NI"/>Pretending to be grief-stricken Māyāśiva said “She who
<div n="lb"/>does not give sexual pleasure to a man in distress would
<div n="lb"/>go to hell. I have no pārṣadas now. I have lost my
<div n="lb"/>sons also. I lost my house. Now you also hate me. I am
<div n="lb"/>going to my cave. Let me end my life there. Come
<div n="lb"/>on, Nandikeśa, Vajra, we will go.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this Pārvatī went near him.
<div n="NI"/>At this time there happened a few bad omens in the
<div n="lb"/>ocean of milk where Viṣṇu was residing, and calling
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa to his side Viṣṇu asked him to go and enquire
<div n="lb"/>about the battle that was going on between the devas and
<div n="lb"/>asuras. To prevent him from being deceived by the magic
<div n="lb"/>of the asuras Viṣṇu dropped into the mouth of Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>a pill of great potency. Garuḍa reached the battlefield
<div n="lb"/>very soon but could not find anything out of the way
<div n="lb"/>and so flew to Kailāsa. He did not see Pārvatī first but
<div n="lb"/>hearing a noise from somewhere else peeped in and
<div n="lb"/>saw Māyāśiva. Garuḍa could understand him because of
<div n="lb"/>the power of the pill and so flew swiftly back to Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu and told him what he saw.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu knew that Pārvatī had been deceived by
<div n="lb"/>Jalandhara. So he decided to cheat Vṛndā, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Jalandhara. Mahāviṣṇu filled with amorous desires,
<div n="lb"/>avoiding Mahālakṣmī, covering his head with a
<div n="lb"/>yellow scarf and taking the figure of another person by
<div n="lb"/>his yogic powers stepped out of his abode taking Ananta
<div n="lb"/>for his company. He went to Durgākānana the abode
<div n="lb"/>of Vṛndā. They constructed an āśrama there and the
<div n="lb"/>wild animals like the lion, tiger, boar, bear and monkey
[Page497-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>became their disciples taking human form. Then Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>created mental agony in Vṛndā to attract her to his
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. Vṛndā started getting hot and her maids
<div n="lb"/>fanned her continuously and anointed her with sandal-
<div n="lb"/>wood paste. She thought of her husband in the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field and often fainted. She had a very bad dream. She
<div n="lb"/>saw her husband Jalandhara lying wounded on his
<div n="lb"/>head, ears and nose, with his body smeared with ashes
<div n="lb"/>and his eyes pecked by vultures. She saw Kālī, with her
<div n="lb"/>hair lying lose, her face reddened with blood, with a
<div n="lb"/>skull in her hand dancing before the body of her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band before starting to eat it. At this moment she was
<div n="lb"/>awakened by the music of the Māgadhas and loud
<div n="lb"/>chanting of family praises by Kimpuruṣas. She at once
<div n="lb"/>stopped the music and prayers and paid them off. Then
<div n="lb"/>she sent word for pandits to explain the dream she saw.
<div n="lb"/>The Pandits said “Devī, this appears to be a dream
<div n="lb"/>giving unimaginable fear. To calm the fear give as gifts
<div n="lb"/>to brahmins, diamonds, garments, cows and elephants.”
<div n="lb"/>Then the brahmin pandits sprinkled on her, water made
<div n="lb"/>potent by mantras. There was no waning of the fever.
<div n="lb"/>Dismissing the pandits, queen Vṛndā went and sat
<div n="lb"/>alone upstairs. She felt the whole palace burning and
<div n="lb"/>by the craft employed by Viṣṇu she found living inside
<div n="lb"/>the palace unbearable.
<div n="NI"/>She got out of the palace and boarding a chariot drawn
<div n="lb"/>by mares she went to her play-garden. The sight of
<div n="lb"/>the garden filled with beautiful flowers and celestial
<div n="lb"/>maidens where no one else but pleasing breeze could
<div n="lb"/>enter made her remember her husband. She then
<div n="lb"/>brooded on how to find out Jalandhara, and there also
<div n="lb"/>she did not get peace of mind. So she accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by her maids started for another garden. That garden
<div n="lb"/>gave a ghastly sight with huge trees standing crowded
<div n="lb"/>interspersed with black rocks and the place resounding
<div n="lb"/>with the roars of lions and tigers. Vṛndā got frightened
<div n="lb"/>and she hastened to say “Smaradūtī, I feel frightened.
<div n="lb"/>Please drive back the chariot home.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Smaradūtī said, “Oh, Devī, I do not know
<div n="lb"/>the place. I do not understand the directions also. To
<div n="lb"/>which direction am I to drive? The horses look tired.
<div n="lb"/>There is no way here. Anyhow let it go as directed by
<div n="lb"/>God. If we stay here we will be eaten by man-eaters.”
<div n="lb"/>So saying the maid drove the chariot and soon they
<div n="lb"/>reached a forest more grisly than the former. It was a
<div n="lb"/>forest where great yogins lived. There was no light
<div n="lb"/>there neither water nor wind. No sound came. Even
<div n="lb"/>the sounds of the bells on the horses and the chariot
<div n="lb"/>stopped. Vṛndā moaned, “Where are we to go now,
<div n="lb"/>maid! There is no peace of mind for me anywhere in
<div n="lb"/>this world.”
<div n="NI"/>Smaradūtī looking ahead cried, “Look Devī, there is a
<div n="lb"/>great black mountain in front of us. The horses refuse
<div n="lb"/>to move, for they are afraid of it.”
<div n="NI"/>Cold with fear the queen stood up from the chariot and
<div n="lb"/>keeping her hands on the pearl necklace on her breast
<div n="lb"/>jumped out of the chariot. Then a very fierce demon
<div n="lb"/>came towards them. He was yellow in colour with three
<div n="lb"/>legs, five hands, seven eyes and ears like a tiger's and
<div n="lb"/>the shoulders and chin like those of a lion. It was a
<div n="lb"/>horrible sight and Vṛndā hid her eyes with her hands
<div n="lb"/>and trembled like a plantain leaf. The maid jumping
<div n="lb"/>out of the chariot cried aloud “Oh, my queen, help me.
<div n="lb"/>This demon is going to eat me.” The demon approaching
[Page498-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>them took the chariot with the horses and whirled it
<div n="lb"/>round in the air. Both the queen and the maid fainted
<div n="lb"/>at this exhibition of strength. The demon ate all the
<div n="lb"/>horses and then catching hold of the hands of the queen
<div n="lb"/>he roared, “If you want your life make me your husband.
<div n="lb"/>Your husband has been killed by Śiva in the battle. If
<div n="lb"/>you join me you can live for years together without
<div n="lb"/>fear. Come on, drink this sweet liquor with flesh”.
<div n="lb"/>Vṛndā became half dead when she heard that.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Mahāviṣṇu in the guise of an ascetic
<div n="lb"/>wearing barks of trees and matted hair appeared
<div n="lb"/>before them. An angered look form Viṣṇu sent the
<div n="lb"/>demon away from the place. Vṛndā took refuge in the
<div n="lb"/>ascetic and the false ascetic said, “I am Devaśarmā, son
<div n="lb"/>of Bharadvāja. Renouncing all worldly pleasures I have
<div n="lb"/>come here to do penance and if it pleases you, you can
<div n="lb"/>come and stay in my āśrama and do penance. We can
<div n="lb"/>go to another forest far away from here.” As soon as
<div n="lb"/>they reached the āśrama Mahāviṣṇu appeared before
<div n="lb"/>her in the figure of Jalandhara. They embraced each
<div n="lb"/>other and lived there joyfully for many days. One day
<div n="lb"/>at the end of a sexual act Vṛndā saw instead of Jalan-
<div n="lb"/>dhara the ascetic in embrace with her. She was shocked
<div n="lb"/>and stood up separated from him. Then Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>said “Vṛndā, I am Viṣṇu husband of Lakṣmī. Your
<div n="lb"/>husband has gone to conquer Śiva and get Parvatī for
<div n="lb"/>himself. I am Śiva also. We appear separate. Your hus-
<div n="lb"/>band Jalandhara has been killed in the battle. Join with
<div n="lb"/>me.”
<div n="NI"/>Vṛndā got angry. She cursed Viṣṇu ; she said, “You
<div n="lb"/>cheated me by pretending to be an ascetic. Let your
<div n="lb"/>wife also be once cheated by a false ascetic.” The
<div n="lb"/>cursed Viṣṇu disappeared and Vṛndā started penance.
<div n="lb"/>Many Gandharva ladies came with temptations to dis-
<div n="lb"/>suade Vṛndā from continuing the penance. But all such
<div n="lb"/>attempts failed and Vṛndā ended her life doing penance.
<div n="NI"/>The nymphs showered flowers on her from above and
<div n="lb"/>the dead body of Vṛndā was cremated by Smaradūtī
<div n="lb"/>and Smaradūtī jumped into the funeral pyre of Vṛndā
<div n="lb"/>and gave away her life. The nymphs made an image of
<div n="lb"/>her with the ashes from the funeral pyre and floated it
<div n="lb"/>on the river Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>Pārvatī did not consent to having any sexual enjoyment
<div n="lb"/>with Māyāśiva and she escaped from the place and went
<div n="lb"/>to Ākāśagaṅgā and started doing penance there. One day
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī called her maid Jayā to her side and said “Jayā
<div n="lb"/>you go in my dress to Śiva and find out whether he is
<div n="lb"/>really Śiva or not. If he kisses you and embraces you he
<div n="lb"/>will surely be a dānava come in disguise by his Māyā.
<div n="lb"/>But if he asks you about my welfare he will be real Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Go and tell me what happens.”
<div n="NI"/>Jayā went to Māyāśiva. Jalandhara when he saw her
<div n="lb"/>mistook her for Pārvatī and caught hold of her and
<div n="lb"/>immediately semen flowed out from him. Jayā returned
<div n="lb"/>and told Pārvatī that it was Jalandhara and not Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī afraid of Jalandhara hid in a lotus and her
<div n="lb"/>companions became beetles sitting on the lotus. In the
<div n="lb"/>meantime the guards of the palace finding the queen
<div n="lb"/>absent from the palace reported the matter to Śumbha
<div n="lb"/>fighting against Śiva. He sent Caṇḍamuṇḍas to Jalan-
<div n="lb"/>dhara to inform him of the situation. Jalandhara-came
<div n="lb"/>back to the battle-field running and took up the fight
<div n="lb"/>against Śiva again.
