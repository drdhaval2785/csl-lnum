SATYATAPAS¦ (UTATHYA) I. A brahmin boy who was
<div n="lb"/>changed into a cobra by the curse of a saint called
<div n="lb"/>Godila. The original name of this youth was Utathya.
<div n="lb"/>Later he came to be known as Satyatapas. The story of
<div n="lb"/>this Śatyatapas is given in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 3,
<div n="lb"/>as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>In days of old, there was a Brahmin named Devadatta
<div n="lb"/>in Kosala. His wife was called Rohiṇī. Though much
<div n="lb"/>time elapsed no child was born to them. At last Deva-
<div n="lb"/>datta performed the sacrifice called Putrakāmeṣṭi, on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river Tamasā. Several saintly persons
<div n="lb"/>took part in the sacrifice. Suhotra was detailed as
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Yājñavalkya as officiating priest, Bṛhaspati as
<div n="lb"/>sacrificer, Paila to recite Vedas and Godila to sing Sāman
<div n="lb"/>hymns. The singing of Godila, an expert singer, caused
<div n="lb"/>horripilation to everybody in the sacrificial hall. But in
<div n="lb"/>the middle of singing he had to take breath, and there
<div n="lb"/>occurred a solecism in his voice. Devadatta did not like
<div n="lb"/>it. He warned Godila, who instantly became angry and
<div n="lb"/>said to Devadatta. “Since you called me Cobra, the son
<div n="lb"/>born to you will become a cobra.”
[Page708-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta became miserable and begged Godila by
<div n="lb"/>holding his feet to pardon him. He gave liberation
<div n="lb"/>from the curse that his son would be a cobra and
<div n="lb"/>said that he would become a sage.
<div n="NI"/>The wife of Devadatta became pregnant and gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a son. He was named Utathya. In the
<div n="lb"/>eighth year, the ceremony of investiture with the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā string was performed and the boy commenced
<div n="lb"/>education. The teacher began to teach the Vedas.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards the boy became self-conceited.
<div n="lb"/>All the attempts made by the teacher to change his
<div n="lb"/>behaviour were futile. His father tried the four ex-
<div n="lb"/>pedients in vain. Thus twelve years elapsed. The
<div n="lb"/>boy did not even learn the evening prayer. Everybody
<div n="lb"/>thought that he was a cobra. All scoffed at him. His
<div n="lb"/>own people disliked him; with this; self-renunciation
<div n="lb"/>took root in his boyish mind and he left his home and
<div n="lb"/>went away. He reached the banks of the Ganges and
<div n="lb"/>made a hut there and lived there observing rigorous
<div n="lb"/>celibacy, and vow of truth. Thus the boy-hermit
<div n="lb"/>began severe penance.
<div n="NI"/>He had learned no rites or rituals according to the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. He would rise early in the morning, and after
<div n="lb"/>cleaning the teeth he would take a dip in the Gangetic
<div n="lb"/>waters, without any spells or actions and return to the
<div n="lb"/>hut. He would eat anything that came by. He would
<div n="lb"/>cause no harm to anybody, though he had no power to
<div n="lb"/>do good to anybody. Everybody in the neighbourhood
<div n="lb"/>began to realize that he was a boy who would on no
<div n="lb"/>account utter falsehood. So all began to call him
<div n="lb"/>Satyatapas. Satyatapas had no peace of mind. Life
<div n="lb"/>seemed to be a burden to him. He became thoughtful
<div n="lb"/>day and night. Thus he spent fourteen years there.
<div n="lb"/>People firmly believed in his truthfulness. So they
<div n="lb"/>named him Satyavrata. Once a forester came near his
<div n="lb"/>hut. He sent an arrow at a hog, which ran into the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage with the arrow sticking on its body. Blood
<div n="lb"/>was oozing from its wound. The jungle-dweller also
<div n="lb"/>came into the hut following the hog. Seeing Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata the man asked “Where is the hog that I had
<div n="lb"/>shot?” Satyavrata who knew that killing animals was a
<div n="lb"/>sin, kept silence to save the beast. Devī was pleased
<div n="lb"/>at the moral courage and truthfulness of Satyavrata. It
<div n="lb"/>is said that the moment the hog got into the hermitage,
<div n="lb"/>the Sārasvata syllable ‘Ai’ arose from the tongue of
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata. The moment he had pronounced the
<div n="lb"/>root-sound of Sarasvatī, ‘Ai’, by the grace of Devī, he
<div n="lb"/>became a poet like Vālmīki. Looking at the forester
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata said:
<Poem>“Yāḥ paśyati na sa brūte
<div n="lb"/>Yo brūte sa na paśyati /
<div n="lb"/>Aho! vyādha, svakāryārthin
<div n="lb"/>Kam pṛcchasi punaḥ punaḥ //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>“He who sees does not speak. He who speaks, does not
<div n="lb"/>see. Selfish hunter, whom do you ask again and again?”
<div n="lb"/>When the forester heard these words of Satyavrata, the
<div n="lb"/>bow and arrow fell from his hands. With self-renun-
<div n="lb"/>ciation he went away from the hermitage. The fame
<div n="lb"/>of the great poet Satyavrata spread everywhere. His
<div n="lb"/>father also heard about this from others. He came to
<div n="lb"/>the bank of the Ganges and took his son home. Even
<div n="lb"/>today Brahmins sing about the fame of that hermit on
<div n="lb"/>the New moon days.
