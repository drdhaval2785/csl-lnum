GAṄGĀ¦. The famous and holy river of India.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin and general information.%} Gaṅgā had its origin
<div n="lb"/>during the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Vāmana. When
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana measured the three worlds in three steps the
<div n="lb"/>nails on his left feet were raised high. They caused a
<div n="lb"/>pore on the upper side of the universe. Gaṅgā, starting
<div n="lb"/>from the finger of Viṣṇu's feet fell in heaven (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata).
<div n="NI"/>The famous Viṣṇupadī, the flowing water (tīrtha) of
<div n="lb"/>which washes away the sins of the people in the universe
<div n="lb"/>is the very same Gaṅgā under discussion. For many
<div n="lb"/>yugas (eras) this river confined itself to the heights of
<div n="lb"/>the sky, otherwise called Viṣṇupada. This particular
<div n="lb"/>spot is known as Dhruvamaṇḍala as it is here that
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva, son of King Uttānapāda, does, his penance.
<div n="lb"/>The seven sages who constantly go round and round
<div n="lb"/>the Dhruvamaṇḍala take their bath in this holy river.
<div n="lb"/>The course of the river is thus: starting from Viṣṇupada
<div n="lb"/>it falls on devayāna glittering with crores of vimānas
<div n="lb"/>and therefrom it descends on Candramaṇḍala which it
<div n="lb"/>submerges. It follows its course again from there divid-
<div n="lb"/>ing itself into four tributaries called Sītā, Cakṣus,
<div n="lb"/>Alakanandā and Bhadrā and then falls in Brahmaloka
<div n="lb"/>wherefrom it flows in all directions. Of the four tributa-
<div n="lb"/>ries Sītā falls on the head of Mount Meru, flows down
<div n="lb"/>to Gandhamādana, then circling through Bhadrāśva
<div n="lb"/>varṣa falls into the eastern sea. Cakṣus falls on the
<div n="lb"/>peaks of mount Mālyavān, flows through Ketumāla
<div n="lb"/>and falls into the western sea. Alakanandā falls on
<div n="lb"/>mount Hemakūṭa, flows through Bhārata Varṣa and falls
<div n="lb"/>into the southern sea. And Bhadrā falls on the head
<div n="lb"/>of mount Śṛṅgavān flows through Uttarakuru and falls
<div n="lb"/>into the northern sea. Alakanandā flows through
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata Varṣa and is regarded as the most sacred of the
<div n="lb"/>four tributaries.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṅgā which flowed through heaven fell on the earth
<div n="lb"/>after thousands of years of its origin. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Pañcama, Skandha, Chapter 17).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Why Gaṅgā became Śiva's consort.%} Mahāviṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>once engaged at Vaikuṇṭha in a pleasant talk with his
<div n="lb"/>wives, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā when Gaṅgā cast
<div n="lb"/>lustful eyes on Viṣṇu, who, behind the backs of the
<div n="lb"/>other two wives returned the lustful glances. Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>could not put up with that situation for a long time.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, she got up from her seat and beat Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī tried to restrain Sarasvatī lest the quarrel should
<div n="lb"/>become fiercer. Angered at this intervention Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>cursed that Lakṣmī be born on earth. Gaṅgā got angry
<div n="lb"/>that innocent Lakṣmī was thus cursed, and she in her
[Page277-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>turn cursed that Sarasvatī be born as a river on earth.
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī did not take the curse lying down, but cursed
<div n="lb"/>that Gaṅgā also be born as a river on earth and take
<div n="lb"/>upon herself the sins of the whole world. When all the
<div n="lb"/>three wives of Viṣṇu got themselves thus into trouble
<div n="lb"/>he told them as follows: “Everything has happened as
<div n="lb"/>it should have happened. Lakṣmī may go to the earth
<div n="lb"/>and be born in the home of Dharmadhvaja and grow
<div n="lb"/>up as his daughter, but not from the womb of his
<div n="lb"/>women. There you will purify the three worlds after
<div n="lb"/>which you will be born as the plant called tulasī, and
<div n="lb"/>be married by an asura called Śaṅkhacūḍa, who will be
<div n="lb"/>born as a part of me. And, after that you will be turned
<div n="lb"/>into a sacred river called Padmāvatī, and leaving the
<div n="lb"/>river on earth your divine form will return to Vaikuṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭha.” And, to Gaṅgā Viṣṇu said as follows: “You will
<div n="lb"/>go to earth as a holy river to wash off the sins of people
<div n="lb"/>there. A king called Bhagīratha will be leading you to
<div n="lb"/>earth, and you will, therefore, be known as Bhāgīrathī
<div n="lb"/>also. And, you remain there on earth as the wife of the
<div n="lb"/>ocean of King Śantanu. Your divine form will return
<div n="lb"/>to mount Kailāsa as the consort of Śiva.” As for Sara-
<div n="lb"/>svatī, Viṣṇu asked her to be born as a river on earth,
<div n="lb"/>her divine form ultimately returning to Satyaloka and
<div n="lb"/>then becoming the consort of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>And, thus it was that Lakṣmī became the consort of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāvīṣṇu, Gaṅgā of Śiva and Sarasvatī of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gaṅgā born on earth due to the curse of Brahmā.%} Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhiṣak, an emperor of the Ikṣvāku dynasty, went
<div n="lb"/>to Satyaloka after he had attained heaven, to worship
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Gaṅgā too happened to be there. In the
<div n="lb"/>devotional atmosphere at Satyaloka a casual breeze
<div n="lb"/>removed Gaṅgā's clothes slightly from position, and
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhiṣak then cast a lustful glance at her which she
<div n="lb"/>also returned. Brahmā, who was observing this exchange
<div n="lb"/>of love got angry and cursed that Mahābhīṣak be born
<div n="lb"/>as a King on earth and Gaṅgā as his wife. Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>prayed for redemption from the curse, and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>told her that she would regain her old status after she
<div n="lb"/>had delivered the Aṣṭavasus. As the consequence of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's cure Mahābhiṣak was born as King Śantanu
<div n="lb"/>in the solar dynasty on earth and he married Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapters 96 and 97).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Bhagīratha brought down Gaṅgā on earth.%} King Sagara
<div n="lb"/>of the solar dynasty had two wives called Sumati (Vai-
<div n="lb"/>darbhī) and Keśinī (Śaibyā). A son called Asamañjasa
<div n="lb"/>was born to Keśinī, and 60,000 princes were born to
<div n="lb"/>Sumati. Sagara drove out of the country Asamajñasaa,
<div n="lb"/>who turned out to be an enemy of the people. The
<div n="lb"/>60,000 sons of Sagara also proved to be a menace to the
<div n="lb"/>world, and the Devas approached Brahmā for protection
<div n="lb"/>from the menace. He assured the Devas that a sage
<div n="lb"/>called Kapila will destroy the 60,000 evil fellows.
<div n="NI"/>During the above period of time Sagara performed an
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha Yajña, and his sons went round the earth
<div n="lb"/>with the sacrificial horse. But, when they reached the
<div n="lb"/>sea-shore the horse disappeared. When the sons comp-
<div n="lb"/>lained about it to their father, Sagara, he asked them
<div n="lb"/>to look out for the horse in every part of the world and
<div n="lb"/>bring it back. Not finding it anywhere on earth they
<div n="lb"/>dug a hole and entered Pātāla, where they saw Sage
<div n="lb"/>Kapila absorbed in meditation and the missing horse
<div n="lb"/>tied to a pole near the sage. (It was Indra who had
<div n="lb"/>carried away the horse and tied it there). The sons of
[Page277-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Sagara, believing that it was Kapila who had stolen
<div n="lb"/>the horse were about to attack the sage when he opened
<div n="lb"/>his eyes, and they were reduced to ashes in the fire of
<div n="lb"/>Kapila's eyes.
<div n="NI"/>His sons having not returned even after a long time
<div n="lb"/>Sagara asked his grandson Aṃśumān to seek them out,
<div n="lb"/>and after an extensive search he saw Kapila at Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśumān pleased Kapila with laudatory phrases and
<div n="lb"/>the latter returned to him the sacrificial horse. Kapila
<div n="lb"/>also pronounced the blessing that the grandson of Aṃ-
<div n="lb"/>śumān would perform the purificatory rites of Sagara's
<div n="lb"/>sons by bringing down Gaṅgā to earth from heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśumān returned to the palace with the horse and
<div n="lb"/>the aśvamedha was duly concluded.
<div n="NI"/>From Aṃśumān was born Dilīpa and from him Bhagī-
<div n="lb"/>ratha. On becoming King, Bhagīratha handed over the
<div n="lb"/>reins of government to his ministers and began efforts
<div n="lb"/>to bring down Gaṅgā to earth. He did tapas for thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand years on the slopes of the Himālayas when Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>asked him to please Śiva first as he alone could face her
<div n="lb"/>(Gaṅgā) fall on the earth. Accordingly he pleased Śiva
<div n="lb"/>by his penance and Śiva agreed to receive Gaṅgā on
<div n="lb"/>his head. With a terrific noise Gaṅgā came down on
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's head. The haughty Gaṅgā wanted to carry down
<div n="lb"/>Śiva also to Pātāla. Realising this ambition of her
<div n="lb"/>Śiva blocked her passage with the result that she wan-
<div n="lb"/>dered about in Śiva's matted hair for many years
<div n="lb"/>without finding an outlet. Bhagīratha again did tapas
<div n="lb"/>and pleased Śiva who shook his matted head and made
<div n="lb"/>fall some water therefrom on earth. The water fell into
<div n="lb"/>Bindusaras, and flowed in seven tributaries, the first
<div n="lb"/>three, Hlādinī, Pāvanī and Nalinī towards the east, the
<div n="lb"/>next three, Sucakṣus, Sītā and Sindhu towards the west
<div n="lb"/>and the seventh tributary followed Bhagīratha. In this
<div n="lb"/>manner they progressed a great distance till they reach-
<div n="lb"/>ed the āśrama of the sage Jahnu, and the haughty
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā flooded the āśrama. The sage got enraged at
<div n="lb"/>this and drank up Gaṅgā. But Bhagīratha pleased the
<div n="lb"/>sage who then let out Gaṅgā through his ears. Thence-
<div n="lb"/>forth Gaṅgā came to be called Jāhnavī also. Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>again followed Bhagīratha to Pātāla and made the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Sagara attain salvation by purifying them with her
<div n="lb"/>waters. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Cantos 43
<div n="lb"/>and 44; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 97; Devī Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Dvitīya Skandha; Droṇa Parva, Chapter 60; Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 4 and Vana Parva, Chapter 109).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Gaṅgā flowed into the sea.%} After the purificatory rites
<div n="lb"/>of the sons of Sagara were over, Bhagīratha conducted
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā to the sea and with its waters the sea became
<div n="lb"/>full. (Vana Parva, Chapter 109, Verses 18-21).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Gaṅgā set on the thighs of Pratīpa.%} Gaṅgā once fell
<div n="lb"/>in love with Pratīpa, father of Śantanu, and set on his
<div n="lb"/>right thigh when he (Pratīpa) was doing penance on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the Gaṅgā for a son. Pratīpa did not agree
<div n="lb"/>to Gaṅgā's proposal that he should marry her and told
<div n="lb"/>her thus: “the right thigh is for the children and
<div n="lb"/>daughters-in-law to sit on and the left thigh for the
<div n="lb"/>wife; therefore, you be my son's wife.”
<div n="NI"/>Then Pratīpa called his son Śantanu and told him:
<div n="lb"/>“Sometime back a divine woman came to me and I
<div n="lb"/>promised to wed her to you. Therefore, if any divine
<div n="lb"/>woman approaches you for a son you must accept her,
<div n="lb"/>and whatever she may do you must not object to
<div n="lb"/>that...”. Not long after this Pratīpa crowned Śantanu
[Page278-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>King and left for the forest, (Ādi Parva, Chapter 97).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Aṣṭavasus and Gaṅgā.%} While the wife of Dyau, one
<div n="lb"/>of the Aṣṭavasus (eight Vasus) was roaming about in
<div n="lb"/>the forest she saw Nandinī (the divine cow) grazing
<div n="lb"/>with her calf near the āśrama of Vasiṣṭha, and she
<div n="lb"/>desired to have the cow to be presented to her intimate
<div n="lb"/>friend Jitavatī, the daughter of King Uśīnara. She
<div n="lb"/>informed her husband, Dyau about this desire of hers,
<div n="lb"/>and Dyau told his relations about it. Next day the
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭavasus, in the absence of Vasiṣṭha at the āśrama,
<div n="lb"/>stole off Nandinī and her calf. When Vasiṣṭha returned
<div n="lb"/>to the āśrama the cow and calf were missing, and he
<div n="lb"/>divined the reason for it with his divine eyes. He cursed
<div n="lb"/>that the Aṣṭavasus be born as men on earth, and when
<div n="lb"/>they prayed for redemption from the curse Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>told them that they would be born as men within one
<div n="lb"/>year from that day, die at once and return to heaven
<div n="lb"/>At the same time the sage said that Dyau alone, who
<div n="lb"/>took the leading part in stealing the cow, would live on
<div n="lb"/>earth for a longer period before he returned to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(The reputed Bhīṣma was this Dyau). The Aṣṭavasus
<div n="lb"/>set out for the earth to be born as men and on their
<div n="lb"/>way they met Gaṅgā and told her about their curse
<div n="lb"/>etc. Gaṅgā also told them about her curse, and permitt-
<div n="lb"/>ed them to be born in her womb. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>99).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Gaṅgā became the wife of Śantanu and the Aṣṭavasus were%}
<div n="lb"/>{%born.%} Once while hunting on the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu saw a beautiful maiden and they fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with each other. She agreed to become his wife on the
<div n="lb"/>condition that he would not oppose whatever she said.
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu agreed to it and married her. Soon after a
<div n="lb"/>child was born to them and in the very presence of
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu, she threw the child into the Gaṅgā. As per
<div n="lb"/>previous condition Śantanu kept mum at this. She
<div n="lb"/>threw into the river the seven Aṣṭavasus, who were
<div n="lb"/>born to her in succession. When she was about to
<div n="lb"/>throw the last eighth of the Aṣṭavasus (Dyau) into
<div n="lb"/>the river Śantanu prevented her. She got angry at
<div n="lb"/>this and disappeared with the child. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 98).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śantanu got back the son.%} Thirtytwo years after,
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu went hunting again on the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>where he saw the river obstructed in its course with
<div n="lb"/>arrows by a handsome boy. Śantanu did not recognise
<div n="lb"/>that the boy was his son, who had been named Deva-
<div n="lb"/>vrata by Gaṅgā. Devavrata disappeared after throwing
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu into an illusion by his magic power. All of a
<div n="lb"/>sudden a doubt dawned in his mind whether the boy
<div n="lb"/>was his own son, and he called out to Gaṅgā to show
<div n="lb"/>him the boy. Gaṅgā appeared with her son with beau-
<div n="lb"/>tiful ornaments on him and spoke to Śantanu thus:
<div n="lb"/>“This is Devavrata, the eighth son whom you entrusted
<div n="lb"/>to me. He has mastered everything in archery from
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, and he is Dyau (the vasu) son of Aṅgi-
<div n="lb"/>ras reborn. You may please take charge of him.” After
<div n="lb"/>saying this she returned to heaven. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 100).
<div n="NI"/>10) Gaṅgā and Subrahmaṇya. (See under Subrahma-
<div n="lb"/>ṇya).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Gaṅgā and Bhīṣma. (See under Bhīṣma).%}
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Greatness (divine nature) of Gaṅgā.%} Mahābhārata has
<div n="lb"/>(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 26), the following on the
<div n="lb"/>greatness of Gaṇgā.—
<div n="NI"/>If, after death, the bones of the dead are deposited
[Page278-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>in Gaṅgā the departed will attain heaven. Even if one
<div n="lb"/>had sinned throughout his life he would attain Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>pāda (heaven) if he worshipped Gaṅgā. Bathing in the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā is as beneficial as performing hundred yajñas.
<div n="lb"/>As long as the bones of one remain in the waters of the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā so long will he occupy an honourable seat in
<div n="lb"/>heaven. He who has come in contact with its water will
<div n="lb"/>shine forth as the sun devoid of all darkness. Places
<div n="lb"/>which are not favoured by its waters will become barren
<div n="lb"/>like night without the moon and trees without flowers.
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā water is more than enough to satisfy living
<div n="lb"/>things in all the three worlds. He who does penance
<div n="lb"/>standing on one leg for thousand years, and he who
<div n="lb"/>gives up his body in the waters of the Gaṅgā are on
<div n="lb"/>a par with each other. God attaches more importance
<div n="lb"/>to him who has fallen into the Gaṅgā than to him, who
<div n="lb"/>has performed tapas hanging by his head for a thousand
<div n="lb"/>years. He who smears the sand on the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>on his body will get the lustre and glow of the devas,
<div n="lb"/>and he, who smears the sand on his head will shine
<div n="lb"/>forth like the Sun. All the sins of those on whom has
<div n="lb"/>blown the air which had come in contact with Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>water will be swept away. It should be known that
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā water can wash off all sins and purify mortals.
<div n="lb"/>The Agni Purāṇa (Chapter 110) has the following on
<div n="lb"/>this subject.
<div n="NI"/>Through whatever places the Gaṅgā flows those places
<div n="lb"/>become sublime and sacred. Gaṅgā is the refuge of all
<div n="lb"/>created beings who aspire for the final good. If Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>is worshipped daily it will save families both on the
<div n="lb"/>mother's and the father's side from evil fate. To drink
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā water is better than the observance of a thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand lunar months. If one worships Gaṅgā for a month
<div n="lb"/>one will derive all the benefits of having performed all
<div n="lb"/>the yajñas. Even the blind (the ignorant) who worship
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā, will attain equal status with the devas. The
<div n="lb"/>sight of Gaṅgā, contact with its waters and drinking
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā water will purify people in thousands and lakhs.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Gaṅgā and Rādhā.%} Gaṅgā is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa li-
<div n="lb"/>quidified into water. Once in goloka Rādhādevī attempt-
<div n="lb"/>ed to drink Gaṅgā dry, who, terror-stricken, hid
<div n="lb"/>herself at the feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the whole
<div n="lb"/>world experienced difficulties due to non-availability
<div n="lb"/>of water. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to know of the situation and
<div n="lb"/>made Gaṅgā appear again on earth. (Devībhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Symbols and vehicle of Gaṅgā.%} Gaṅgā, white in colour
<div n="lb"/>rests on makaramatsya (a variety of fish) holding in
<div n="lb"/>her hands a pot and lotus flowers. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 50).
