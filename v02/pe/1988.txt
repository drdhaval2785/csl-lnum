DHṚṢṬADYUMNA¦. The son of King Drupada. He was
<div n="lb"/>brother of Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Drupada and Droṇa were fellow students. After
<div n="lb"/>finishing his education Drupada became King. When
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa came to his palace Drupada did not honour
<div n="lb"/>him. Droṇa got angry, went to Hastināpura and began
<div n="lb"/>to teach the Pāṇḍava and the Kaurava princes in
<div n="lb"/>archery and other weapons. When the weapon-training
<div n="lb"/>was over, Arjuna, at the instruction of Droṇa, defeated
<div n="lb"/>and captured Drupada. Droṇa seized half of his king-
<div n="lb"/>dom from him.
<div n="NI"/>As Drupada was not powerful to wreak vengeance on
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa, he performed a sacrifice to obtain a son who
<div n="lb"/>could take revenge on Droṇa and regain his lost
<div n="lb"/>prestige. A son and a daughter were born from the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fire. The son was named Dhṛṣṭadyumna.
<div n="lb"/>The daughter grew up and became the famous Pāñcālī.
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas married her.
<div n="NI"/>At the time of birth, Dhṛṣṭadyumna had a crown on
<div n="lb"/>his head, and armour on his body, bow, arrows and
<div n="lb"/>sword in his hands. He ran out of the fire into a
<div n="lb"/>chariot and sat in it as if he were about to begin a
<div n="lb"/>travel of conquest. Seeing this the Pāñcālas were filled
<div n="lb"/>with joy. There was a celestial voice: “This boy will
<div n="lb"/>destroy the fear of the Pāñcālas. He is born to slay
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa.” At this time the queen approached the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficing priest with a request that the children born of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fire should consider her as their mother.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly the children accepted the wife of Drupada
<div n="lb"/>as their mother. Brāhmaṇas named the boy Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna and the girl Kṛṣṇā.
<F>1. The fast taken on the eleventh day of the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Vaiśākha.</F>
<F>2. Because he was born with Dhṛṣṭatva (boldness) amarṣatva (impatience) and dyumna (vigour) the son of Drupada was
<div n="lb"/>called Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Draupadī was called Kṛṣṇa as she was of Kṛṣṇa varṇa (dark complexion. Thus Drupada got two children from
<div n="lb"/>‘Makha’ (sacrifice).</F> (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>166). (For more particulars see under ‘Pāñcālī’
<div n="lb"/>Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Till the battle of Bhārata.%} The history of Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna till the battle between the Pāṇḍavas and the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas, is given below.
<div n="NI"/>The news that Dhṛṣṭadyumna was born to kill Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>spread everywhere. The Broad-minded Droṇa did not
<div n="lb"/>seem to mind this news. Droṇa took Dhṛṣṭadyumna to
<div n="lb"/>his house, with the permission of Drupada and gave
<div n="lb"/>him training in the wielding of weapons. He believed
<div n="lb"/>that God's will could not be thwarted. After he had
<div n="lb"/>learned archery Dhṛṣṭadyumna returned to his kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Next, we see Dhṛṣṭadyumna at the svayaṃvara
<div n="lb"/>(marriage) of Pāñcāli. Several kings arrived from
<div n="lb"/>various countries on that occasion. When the auspici-
<div n="lb"/>ous moment came, Dhṛṣṭadyumna brought Pāñcālī to
<div n="lb"/>the nuptial dais. He proclaimed the rules and condi-
<div n="lb"/>tions that the competitors of Svayaṃvara had to
<div n="lb"/>observe. After that he conversed with each king who
<div n="lb"/>was present. In the Svayaṃvara Pāñcālī accepted
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālī were given the
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakāra mandira (the Palace of Kumbhakāra) which
<div n="lb"/>stood in the city of Drupada, to stay for that night.
<div n="lb"/>Though the Pāṇḍavas were in the guise of Brāhmaṇas,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛṣṭadyumna had his own doubts about their identity.
[Page234-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>So he hid himself somewhere in the Palace and kept an
<div n="lb"/>eye on them. This shows his peculiar trait of obser-
<div n="lb"/>vation. After this he returned to his Palace and
<div n="lb"/>pacified his father who had been much worried about
<div n="lb"/>his daughter's selection.
<div n="NI"/>Next, we see Dhṛṣṭadyumna, during the time of the
<div n="lb"/>forest life of the Pāṇḍavas. He consoled Pāñcālī, who
<div n="lb"/>was miserable. After that he took the sons of Pāñcālī,
<div n="lb"/>to his house. While the Pāṇḍavas were living in the
<div n="lb"/>forest ‘Kāmyaka’, Dhṛṣṭadyumna visited them. The
<div n="lb"/>forest life of the Pāṇḍavas came to an end. A battle
<div n="lb"/>between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas became inevi-
<div n="lb"/>table. Then the Pāṇdavas selected Dhṛṣṭadyumna, as
<div n="lb"/>the commander-in-general of their army. He ordered
<div n="lb"/>for a general parade of the army and gave them
<div n="lb"/>instructions. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 166 to 195;
<div n="lb"/>the whole of Sabhā Parva; Vana Parva, Chapters, 12, 22

<div n="lb"/>Chapters 50, 157, 163 and 164).
