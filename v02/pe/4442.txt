MĀTALI¦. Charioteer of Indra. Chapter 69 of Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa gives the following story about the birth of
<div n="lb"/>Mātali.
<div n="NI"/>A child was born to sage Śamīka. It was the time
<div n="lb"/>of Devāsura war. A great army of asuras under the
<div n="lb"/>leadership of Andhaka attacked Devaloka and conquer-
<div n="lb"/>ed it. In the great battle with Andhaka the Vajrā-
<div n="lb"/>yudha of Indra broke into two. Indra was thinking of a
<div n="lb"/>new weapon for him. Mahāviṣṇu then appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and advised him to praise the glory of Agni. Indra
<div n="lb"/>did so and then a divine weapon rose from the fire.
<div n="lb"/>Indra flew at the asuras carrying the new weapon.
<div n="lb"/>There was no clever charioteer to drive the chariot of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. Still, seated in the golden chariot given to
<div n="lb"/>him by the Vasus Indra drove very swiftly against the
<div n="lb"/>asuras. The earth shivered by the din of the chariot-
<div n="lb"/>wheels.
<div n="NI"/>When the earth began to quake the sage Śamīka follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing directions of his wife Tapasvinī placed the child
<div n="lb"/>on the ground outside the hermitage. An astrologer had
<div n="lb"/>told her that a child would become two if it was
<div n="lb"/>placed in an open ground at the time of earth-quake.
<div n="lb"/>Tapasvinī wanted one more child. As soon as her child
<div n="lb"/>was placed on the ground another child identical in
<div n="lb"/>every respect with the first one was born by the side of
<div n="lb"/>the other. But the second child, as soon as it
[Page493-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>was born rose up and ran to Indra for driving his
<div n="lb"/>chariot.
<div n="NI"/>When the Gandharvas knew he was coming to help
<div n="lb"/>Indra, they showered him with brilliance and the child
<div n="lb"/>approaching Indra said “Oh, Lord of the Devas, I
<div n="lb"/>shall be your charioteer.” Indra asked him, “Child,
<div n="lb"/>whose son are you? How will you drive my horse? I
<div n="lb"/>doubt your competence.” The child replied, “I am the
<div n="lb"/>son born to Śamīka on the ground. I have been given
<div n="lb"/>power and brilliance by the Gandharvas and so I am
<div n="lb"/>capable of driving your chariot.” On hearing this, Indra
<div n="lb"/>accepted him as his charioteer and named him Mātali.
