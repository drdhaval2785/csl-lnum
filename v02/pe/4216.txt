<div n="NI"/>(i) Mainda lived in a cave in Kiṣkindhā. While he
<div n="lb"/>was living there Sahadeva one of the Pāṇḍavas came
<div n="lb"/>that way during his victory campaign in Dakṣiṇa
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata and fought with him. Sahadeva was defeated.
<div n="lb"/>But Mainda was pleased with him and gave him many
<div n="lb"/>valuable presents and advised him that no difficulties
<div n="lb"/>should be put against Dharmaputra achieving his
<div n="lb"/>object. (Śloka 18, Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva).

<div n="NI"/>(iv) In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle Mainda and others
