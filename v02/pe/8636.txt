VṚṢADARBHA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} An ancient saintly King in
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata. This King Vṛṣadarbha and another King
<div n="lb"/>named Seduka were righteous as well as experts in
<div n="lb"/>wielding main and subordinate weapons. After com-
<div n="lb"/>pleting the education of Vedas, a brahmin once
<div n="lb"/>approached King Seduka and begged as alms some
<div n="lb"/>horses for giving gift to his teacher. The Brahmin said
<div n="lb"/>“It is my wish that you will give me these horses as
<div n="lb"/>alms.” Seduka said that he had not enough wealth or
<div n="lb"/>horses to give the teacher's gift. Seduka sent the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin to Vṛṣadarbha. The Brahmin went to Vṛṣa-
<div n="lb"/>darbha and begged as alms a thousand horses. The
<div n="lb"/>King whipped the Brahmin. He asked the King why he
<div n="lb"/>was punished as he had done no wrong. The King
<div n="lb"/>asked the Brahmin who was beginning to curse. Ho.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin! Whom are you about to curse? Him who has
<div n="lb"/>not given you alms or another Brahmin? The Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>said. “O, King I am sent here by Seduka. I
<div n="lb"/>begged as he had instructed.”
<div n="NI"/>The King said. “This evening I shall give you all the
<div n="lb"/>tax-collection of this day. You who have been whipped
<div n="lb"/>ought not to be sent emptyhanded.” Accordingly the
<div n="lb"/>whole of the tax collection of that day was given to the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 196).
