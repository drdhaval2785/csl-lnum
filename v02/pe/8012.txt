VARĀHA III¦. (Boar). One of the ten incarnations of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Need for this incarnation.%} Jaya and Vijaya, two door-
<div n="lb"/>keepers of Mahāviṣṇu showed disrespect towards
<div n="lb"/>the famous hermits Sanaka and others who went to
<div n="lb"/>visit Mahāviṣṇu. The angry hermits cursed them to take
<div n="lb"/>birth as asuras. Accordingly Jaya and Vijaya took birth
<div n="lb"/>as the two asuras Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu and
<div n="lb"/>were born from Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Diti.
<div n="NI"/>Even their birth itself was inauspicious. Once, while
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa was carrying on evening worship, his wife was
<div n="lb"/>filled with libido. She embraced Kaśyapa. Because she
<div n="lb"/>got pregnancy in an inauspicious moment, two asura
<div n="lb"/>sons were born. At the time of their birth darkness
<div n="lb"/>spread over the whole of the world, and some ill omens
<div n="lb"/>were seen. The Devas (gods) trembled.
<div n="NI"/>The elder son was called Hiraṇyākṣa and the second
<div n="lb"/>son was called Hiraṇyakaśipu. As Hiraṇyākṣa grew up
<div n="lb"/>he began to quarrel with the Devas. When the fight
<div n="lb"/>grew fierce, he picked up the earth in his hands as a
<div n="lb"/>ball and went under water. There was left only water.
<div n="lb"/>The Devas went to Mahāviṣṇu and prayed to him in
<div n="lb"/>order to get the earth back.
<div n="NI"/>At this time Manu Svāyambhuva, the son of Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>was living with his father looking after his welfare. The
<div n="lb"/>father, who was pleased with the services of his son
<div n="lb"/>said. “My dear son, you should worship Devī, who will
<div n="lb"/>be pleased with your devotion and will bless you. If
<div n="lb"/>she is pleased with you, you will become a famous
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati.” Hearing the words of Brahmā, Svāyam-
<div n="lb"/>bhuva worshipped Devī with ardent devotion, deep
<div n="lb"/>meditation and severe vows and penance, at which
<div n="lb"/>Jagadambā was pleased. She appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>asked him what boon he wanted. Manu requested that
<div n="lb"/>he should be permitted to carry on creation without
<div n="lb"/>any obstruction. Devī gave him permission. Manu
[Page827-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>returned to his father Brahmā and said. “Father, point
<div n="lb"/>out to me a solitary place. I will sit there and create
<div n="lb"/>subjects by the blessings of Devī.” Only when he heard
<div n="lb"/>the request of his son, did Brahmā begin to think about
<div n="lb"/>the exigency of providing his son with such a place. For,
<div n="lb"/>the earth was completely under water. For a long time
<div n="lb"/>even Brahmā was being subjected to much incon-
<div n="lb"/>venience to carry on creation. Only Bhagavān Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) could do anything in this matter. So
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā with the Manus, hermits and others began to
<div n="lb"/>meditate on Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Incarnation.%} Instantly the young one of a Boar
<div n="lb"/>jumped out of the nose of Brahmā through his breath.
<div n="lb"/>That divine figure of Boar stood in the air and began to
<div n="lb"/>grow. Within a few moments, it became a colossal
<div n="lb"/>Being. It grew up as big as an elephant. Soon it be-
<div n="lb"/>came as large as a mountain. Seeing this, Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>the others stood in amazement. The Boar made a grunt
<div n="lb"/>in a loud roaring sound. The people of Janaloka, Satya-
<div n="lb"/>loka etc. understood that it was the sound of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. They raised glory and praise to Bhagavān, who
<div n="lb"/>heard all these praises, but without condescending to
<div n="lb"/>tell anything, looked at all of them with grace and love,
<div n="lb"/>and with a mighty force jumped into the sea. It was
<div n="lb"/>immensely troubled by the manes of God Almighty.
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa prayed to him to save him from them. Bhagvān
<div n="lb"/>folded his mane and went down to the deep water and
<div n="lb"/>made a search for the earth. The Boar walked smelling
<div n="lb"/>and snorting and found out the earth. He slowly lifted
<div n="lb"/>it on his tusks and started from there. On the way, the
<div n="lb"/>fierce and wicked Hiraṇyākṣa hindered him. Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu used his club Nandaka and killed Hiraṇyākṣa. It
<div n="lb"/>was besmeared with his blood; Mahāviṣṇu came up to
<div n="lb"/>the surface of water with the earth. He set the earth
<div n="lb"/>firm over the water. Thus Brahmā gave Manu a place
<div n="lb"/>in the earth which floated on the water like a lotus-leaf,
<div n="lb"/>and empowered him to perform creation.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Incarnation of Boar again.%} The goddess Earth, the
<div n="lb"/>deity of earth which was raised to the surface of water,
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with Mahāviṣṇu and embraced him. He
<div n="lb"/>embraced her in return. These mutual embraces conti-
<div n="lb"/>nued for one complete Devavarṣa (year of God) and
<div n="lb"/>consequently the goddess Earth became tired and weak
<div n="lb"/>and unconscious. So the earth slid down a little under
<div n="lb"/>water. Bhagavān took the form of a Boar again and
<div n="lb"/>lifted the earth to its original place and returned to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 3; Devī Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>Skandhas 8 and 9; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 5; Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapter 91).
