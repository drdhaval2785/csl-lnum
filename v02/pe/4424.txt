MARUTVĀMALA¦. In south India, at the southern tip
<div n="lb"/>of the Sahya ranges, a mountain reputed for medicinal
<div n="lb"/>herbs, may still be seen. This mountain is known by the
<div n="lb"/>name “Marutvāmala”. A legend connected with the
<div n="lb"/>origin of this mountain, is given in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>It was the time of the battle between Śrī Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa's younger brother Vibhīṣaṇa joined
<div n="lb"/>the side of Rāma and fought against Rāvaṇa. The
<div n="lb"/>enraged Rāvaṇa shot his arrow at Vibhīṣaṇa. In his
<div n="lb"/>endeavour to save Vibhīṣaṇa, Lakṣmaṇa fell down
<div n="lb"/>unconscious. Rāma and his followers discussed how

<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa could be revived. Jāmbavān observed that
<div n="lb"/>there was a herb called “Droṇam” in one of the peaks
<div n="lb"/>of the Himālayas and if it was brought at once,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa could be restored to his senses. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>flew to the Himālayas immediately. But although he
<div n="lb"/>combed the forests there, he was not able to find the
<div n="lb"/>herb Droṇam. So he tore away and lifted a whole peak
<div n="lb"/>which was full of all kinds of medicinal herbs and
<div n="lb"/>returned to Laṅkā. Jāmbavān took the needed herbs
<div n="lb"/>from it and deposited the peak at the southern end of
<div n="lb"/>India. This is the present Marutvāmala. (Mala means
<div n="lb"/>mountain).
