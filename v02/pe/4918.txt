PADMĀVATĪ VI¦. Wife of a Vaiśya named Praṇidhi.
<div n="lb"/>Once Praṇidhi went to a neighbouring village for trade.
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī and her companions were one day bathing
<div n="lb"/>in a river nearby when a Śūdra passed that way.
<div n="lb"/>Attracted by her dazzling beauty he remained there
<div n="lb"/>talking to her. The Śūdra named Dharmadhvaja was
<div n="lb"/>greatly enamoured of her and the companions of
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī, noticing that, just to make fun of him said
<div n="lb"/>“If you abandon your life at the point where the rivers
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Yamunā meet you can attain Padmāvatī.”
<div n="lb"/>Without any hesitation, thinking that what they said
<div n="lb"/>was true, he went and ended his life at the place suggest-
<div n="lb"/>ed. Immediately he became a replica of Praṇidhi and
<div n="lb"/>stood before Padmāvatī. The real Praṇidhi also came
<div n="lb"/>there then. Padmāvatī was in a fix to choose the real
<div n="lb"/>husband. Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them then and
<div n="lb"/>asked Pādmāvatī to accept both of them as her husbands
<div n="lb"/>Padmāvatī pleaded it was forbidden for women of her
<div n="lb"/>community to accept more than one husband and then
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu took all the three along with him to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. (Kriyā Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 4).
