VASU¦ XI. A King. He was born to Uttānapāda by
<div n="lb"/>Sūnṛtā. A controversy arose among hermits once, about
<div n="lb"/>cow-sacrifice and for a solution of the problem the
<div n="lb"/>hermits approached this king Vasu, who told them his
<div n="lb"/>perception that the sacrifice of cow was, strictly speak-
<div n="lb"/>ing, a matter of slaughter and as such it was to be for-
<div n="lb"/>bidden. As the hermits could not agree with the King,
<div n="lb"/>they cursed him “Let the King go to Pātāla (under-
<div n="lb"/>world). Vasu then did very severe penance and attained
<div n="lb"/>heaven. (Matsya Purāṇa, 143, 18-25).
