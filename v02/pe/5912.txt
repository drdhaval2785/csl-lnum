SAHASRAMUKHARĀVAṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Daitya King, who ruled Trilokapurī, a
<div n="lb"/>country thousands of miles away from India. Triloka-
<div n="lb"/>purī was an island at the centre of the seas. He was a
<div n="lb"/>terror to the whole world and possessed a thousand
<div n="lb"/>heads and two thousand hands.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Secured boon.%} This Rāvaṇa once went to Satyaloka
<div n="lb"/>and performed the most intense tapas for many years.
<div n="lb"/>Yet, Brahmā did not appear and then he began cutting
<div n="lb"/>his heads one after the other and offering them in the
<div n="lb"/>fire. Nine hundred and ninetynine of his heads were
<div n="lb"/>cut thus. When he was about to cut the last head also,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, fearing the end of the world, appeared and
<div n="lb"/>granted him the following three boons.
<div n="NI"/>(i) You will not die at the hands of anyone, but
<div n="lb"/>a woman.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Brahmāstra, which would annihilate, will be at
<div n="lb"/>your disposal.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) You will also possess an aerial chariot for travels
<div n="lb"/>as you please.

<div n="lb"/>Sahasramukha, who returned to his country with the
<div n="lb"/>boons became emperor of all Daityas and then con-
<div n="lb"/>quered heaven, Pātāla, Kailāsa, Vaikuṇṭha and the
<div n="lb"/>eight regions of the world.
<div n="NI"/>He then defeated Pātālarāvaṇa and wedded his only
<div n="lb"/>daughter Indumukhī. He got as a present a weapon
<div n="lb"/>called Kaṭhorakuṭhāra. He propagated in the world
<div n="lb"/>the customs and practices of heaven with the result
<div n="lb"/>that all the customs of the Devas were derogated. Good
<div n="lb"/>people felt harassed. In the rise of unrighteousness
<div n="lb"/>righteousness became helpless.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Curse.%} Once on his way to his father-in-law's
<div n="lb"/>house Sahasramukharāvaṇa raped a Vidyādhara
<div n="lb"/>woman, Cañcalākṣī, who was performing tapas of
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmīdevī and Cañcalākṣī cursed him that Lakṣmī-
<div n="lb"/>devī would kill him.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Son.%} Vajrabāhu was Sahasramukha's son. He
<div n="lb"/>secured from Śiva Pāśupatāstra and an armour im-
<div n="lb"/>penetrable by anyone. Vajrabāhu captured Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya killed the former.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death.%} Sahasramukha had an army-chief named
<div n="lb"/>Bāṇa and both of them together did incalculable harm
<div n="lb"/>to the three worlds. Śrī Rāma was King of Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>at the time, and Devas and sages complained to him
<div n="lb"/>about Sahasramukha and as soon as the complainants
<div n="lb"/>left Ayodhyā, Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa came there. They
<div n="lb"/>told Rāma about the abduction by Sahasramukha's
<div n="lb"/>second son, Candragupta of Sugrīva's daughter and
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa's daughter-in-law. At once Śrī Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>along with Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, Vibhīṣaṇa, Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>and a great army of monkeys reached Sahasramukha's
<div n="lb"/>capital city. Śrī Rāma sent word to him through
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān that Sugrīva's daughter and Vibhīṣaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>daughter-in-law should be returned, Indra should be
<div n="lb"/>released and that pardon should be begged for, for
<div n="lb"/>his errors. Angered at this message Sahasramukha
<div n="lb"/>deputed Bāṇa to fight Śrī Rāma. Bāṇa was killed in
<div n="lb"/>battle. (See under Bāṇa IV). Then ensued a fierce
<div n="lb"/>battle between Rāma and Sahasramukha, the latter
<div n="lb"/>aided by Candragupta. Aṅgada was about to be
<div n="lb"/>overpowered by Candragupta, and then the following
<div n="lb"/>celestial voice was heard: “Candragupta will not die
<div n="lb"/>as long as his wife Padmāvatī is reciting Brahmamantra
<div n="lb"/>imparted by Brahmā.” Then Vibhīṣaṇa sent Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>to the women's quarters and as a result of the latter
<div n="lb"/>using a ‘Kūṭatantrayantra’ great confusion and
<div n="lb"/>quarrels broke out among the women-folk, and
<div n="lb"/>utilising the opportunity Aṅgada killed Candragupta.
<div n="NI"/>Sahasramukha fought Śrī Rāma single-handed. All
<div n="lb"/>tactics of Rāma proved to be of no use. Then he
<div n="lb"/>remembered Brahmā's boon to Sahasramukha and
<div n="lb"/>Cañcalākṣī's curse upon him. Immediately Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>brought down Sītā from Ayodhyā and the latter shot
<div n="lb"/>the Śaktika arrow at the throat of Sahasramukha and
<div n="lb"/>he was killed. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Uttarakāṇḍa),
