KUṆḌADHĀRA III¦. A cloud. None of the Devas
<div n="lb"/>condescended to bless a poor brahmin, who once per-
<div n="lb"/>formed penance in the forest when a cloud called Kuṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>dhāra appeared and told him that, if the Devas would
<div n="lb"/>permit, he (cloud) would bless him. Immediately the
<div n="lb"/>Deva called Māṇibhadra requested the cloud to bless
<div n="lb"/>the brahmin. The cloud did so and the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>attained salvation. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 271).
