GĀYATRĪ II¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A glorious Vedic mantra. This
<div n="lb"/>mantra has twentyfour letters. There are nineteen
<div n="lb"/>categories of movable and immovable things in this world
<div n="lb"/>and to this if the five elements are added the number
<div n="lb"/>twentyfour is obtained. That is why the Gāyatrī has got
<div n="lb"/>twentyfour letters. (Chapter 4, Bhīṣma Parva). At the
<div n="lb"/>time of Tripura dahana Śiva hung this Gāyatrī mantra
<div n="lb"/>as a string on the top of his chariot (Chapter 34, Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The glory of Gāyatrī.%} If one recites Gāyatrī once one
<div n="lb"/>will be freed from all sins done at that time; if one
<div n="lb"/>recites it ten times all the sins done on one day will be
<div n="lb"/>washed away. Thus, if one recites it a hundred times
<div n="lb"/>the sins of one month; thousand times, the sins of a
<div n="lb"/>year; one lakh times, the sins of his life time; ten lakh
<div n="lb"/>times, the sins of his previous birth; hundred lakh times,
<div n="lb"/>the sins of all his births, will be washed away, If a
<div n="lb"/>man recites it ten crore times he becomes a realised
<div n="lb"/>soul and attains mokṣa. (Navama Skandha, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How to recite Gāyatrī.%} It should be recited sitting
<div n="lb"/>still with your head slightly drawn downwards with
<div n="lb"/>your right palm open upwards, with the fingers raised
<div n="lb"/>and bent to give the shape of the hood of a snake.
<div n="lb"/>Starting from the centre of the ring-finger and counting
<div n="lb"/>down and going up through the centre of the small
<div n="lb"/>finger and touching the top lines on the ring, middle and
<div n="lb"/>forefingers, count down to the base of the forefinger,
<div n="lb"/>you get number ten. This is how the number of recita-
<div n="lb"/>tions is counted. This method is called the Karamālā
<div n="lb"/>(hand rosary) method. This is not the only method
<div n="lb"/>that could be used. You can use a rosary made of
<div n="lb"/>lotus seeds or glass beads. If you are using lotus seeds
<div n="lb"/>you should select white seeds for the rosary. (Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
