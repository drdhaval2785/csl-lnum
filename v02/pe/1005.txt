<F>*) According to verse 12, Chapter 25, of Vana Parva, Bhagīratha is the son of Dilīpa. But most of the Purāṇas refer to him a
<div n="lb"/>he son of Aṃśumān.</F>-Bhagīratha.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Recluse.%} Many years had not lapsed after his coro-
<div n="lb"/>nation as King when, in the heart of Bhagīratha spiri-
<div n="lb"/>tual thoughts began to crop up. A great sage called
<div n="lb"/>Tritula was his guru. Once Bhagīratha asked the guru
<div n="lb"/>what was the means to get rid of worldly sorrows, and
<div n="lb"/>the guru replied as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>The ego will be annihilated when the tendencies and
<div n="lb"/>cravings towards objects of the senses are absolutely
<div n="lb"/>suppressed and the whole and perfect truth is realised
<div n="lb"/>through knowledge, the practice of concentration etc.
<div n="lb"/>The ego will not disappear as long as one does not
<div n="lb"/>become one's real self by completely overcoming the
<div n="lb"/>sense of pride, shame etc. which form the outer case
<div n="lb"/>of worldly life. The egoless state is the ultimate
<div n="lb"/>achievement and most supreme state. Oh! Bhagīratha!
<div n="lb"/>if you would get rid of sentiments like pride etc., give
<div n="lb"/>up all attachment to material objects, become fearless
<div n="lb"/>and gift away, with thoughts concentrated on the inner
<div n="lb"/>self, all your wealth to enemies, and then move among
<div n="lb"/>those enemies, without any sense of ego and pride
<div n="lb"/>about this material body, and take alms from them
<div n="lb"/>(enemies) and also give up me, who am your preceptor
<div n="lb"/>in the matter of knowledge; then you will become the
<div n="lb"/>most sublime Brahma”. This advice of the guru
<div n="lb"/>affected him so much that Bhagīratha, holding his
<div n="lb"/>duties firmly in mind, engaged himself in spiritual
<div n="lb"/>practices, and after spending some time thus he per-
<div n="lb"/>formed, according to rules, the Agniṣṭoma yajña aimed
<div n="lb"/>at gifting away everything. All wealth like cows, land,
<div n="lb"/>horses, gold etc. were distributed in gifts to noble
<div n="lb"/>brahmins and the poor folk according to their eligibi-
<div n="lb"/>lity for the same. Within three days he had gifted away
<div n="lb"/>everything except the clothes he was wearing. And,
<div n="lb"/>then he invited his neighbouring enemy king and gave
<div n="lb"/>to him, without the least hesitation, the kingdom which
<div n="lb"/>had been bereft of all wealth. The ministers and other
<div n="lb"/>citizens felt very sorry about the whole thing. But, Bha-
<div n="lb"/>gīratha left the country at once for other places having
<div n="lb"/>with him only the clothes he was wearing. He spent his
<div n="lb"/>days in various places and forests where he was not
<div n="lb"/>known even by name. Ere long, Bhagīratha attained
<div n="lb"/>ultimate spiritual solace. And, then he accidentally
<div n="lb"/>came to his former kingdom, which was then being
<div n="lb"/>ruled by the enemy King. The ministers and other
<div n="lb"/>citizens to whose houses he went begging for alms
<div n="lb"/>recognised him, and with sorrow unbearable they
<div n="lb"/>appealed to him to accept the throne again and rule
<div n="lb"/>the country. Bhagīratha rejected their request, and,
<div n="lb"/>after staying there for some time, he started for other
<div n="lb"/>places. During this wandering of his he met his old
<div n="lb"/>preceptor, Tritula, and both of them, in company,
<div n="lb"/>toured for some time cities and forests. They felt it very
<div n="lb"/>painful to keep on to their body like that. They
<div n="lb"/>thought like this: “Why should the body be kept like
<div n="lb"/>this. What if this material object continues to exist
<div n="lb"/>or perishes? But let it (the body) continue as long as
<div n="lb"/>it exists without in any way being against the order
<div n="lb"/>of things and ethical practices”. And, in this frame of
<div n="lb"/>mind they traversed the forests. Now, the minister of
<div n="lb"/>a distant kingdom who was on the look out for a
[Page114-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>successor to the King who had died heirless, persuaded
<div n="lb"/>Bhagīratha to accept the Kingship of that country. The
<div n="lb"/>ministers of Bhagīratha's former Kingdom also now
<div n="lb"/>requested him to resume his old kingship, especially
<div n="lb"/>since its new ruler had already expired. Bhagīratha
<div n="lb"/>obliged them, and became once again King of his own
<div n="lb"/>country. (Jñānavāsiṣṭham).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhagīrathaprayatnam. (Himālayan or Herculean effort).%}
<div n="lb"/>Sagara, an old predecessor of Bhagīratha had two
<div n="lb"/>wives called Keśinī and Sumati. Keśinī had one son
<div n="lb"/>named Asamañjas and Sumati 60,000 sons. Sagara
<div n="lb"/>once conducted an Aśvamedha yajña in the Indo-
<div n="lb"/>Gangetic plane, when Indra stole away the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>horse and kept it quite near to sage Kapila who was
<div n="lb"/>doing tapas in Pātāla. The 60,000 sons of Sagara set
<div n="lb"/>out in search of the horse and found it out in Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>At the sight of the horse they shouted themselves
<div n="lb"/>hoarse. Enraged at this sage Kapila reduced those sons
<div n="lb"/>of Sagara to ashes in the fire which emanated from his
<div n="lb"/>eyes.
<div n="NI"/>After entrusting Asamañjas with the duty of perform-
<div n="lb"/>ing the funeral rites of his 60,000 sons Sagara expired.
<div n="lb"/>Asamañjas transferred that duty on to Aṃśumān, and
<div n="lb"/>he to Bhagīratha. Bhagīratha did penance on the sea-
<div n="lb"/>shore concentrating his mind on Gaṅgādevī. The Devī
<div n="lb"/>appeared before Bhagīratha and asked him to choose
<div n="lb"/>what boon he would, and he requested the Devī to per-
<div n="lb"/>form the funeral rites of 60,000 sons of Sagara remain-
<div n="lb"/>ing in the form of ashes in Pātāla. To this Gaṅgādevī
<div n="lb"/>replied that the earth will not be able to withstand
<div n="lb"/>the impact of her powerful flow, but she shall, if Śiva
<div n="lb"/>permits, flow into his matted hair. And, Gaṅgādevī
<div n="lb"/>asked Bhagīratha to first get that permission. This did
<div n="lb"/>not dishearten Bhagīratha, who went to mount Kailāsa
<div n="lb"/>to do penance so that Śiva might grant him his prayer.
<div n="lb"/>He thus did penance for 1000 years. Śiva appeared to
<div n="lb"/>him and agreed to receive the rushing flow of Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>water on his matted head. And, accordingly Śiva stood
<div n="lb"/>in position to receive the rushing waters of Gaṅgā, and
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā flowed on to his head. Even the most powerful
<div n="lb"/>flow of Gaṅgā water on his head did not cause Śiva to
<div n="lb"/>move from his position even by a hair's breadth. This
<div n="lb"/>awakened the conceit in Gaṅgādevī, understanding
<div n="lb"/>which Śiva contained her on his head. Without finding
<div n="lb"/>any outlet the waters of river Gaṅgā flowed along the
<div n="lb"/>matted hairs of Śiva for thousand years. So, Bhagi-
<div n="lb"/>ratha had once again to please Śiva. Thus pleased
<div n="lb"/>again Śiva shook his matted head and one drop of
<div n="lb"/>water fell on the ground, and that is the river Ganges
<div n="lb"/>in North India. The Gaṅgā flowed along plane ground
<div n="lb"/>to Pātāla and performed the funeral rites of Sagara's
<div n="lb"/>sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 108; Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Canto 42; Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>purāṇa, Chapter 97; Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Kampa Rāmāyaṇa (Tamil), Yuddha Kāṇḍa; Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Part 4, Chapter 21).
