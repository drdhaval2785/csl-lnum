NAHUṢA I¦. A famous King of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order:—Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Āyus, the son of Purūravas, married the
<div n="lb"/>princess named Indumatī (Svarbhānukumārī). Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>was the son born to the couple, thanks to the blessing of
<div n="lb"/>the great hermit Dattātreya. Nahuṣa married Aśoka-
<div n="lb"/>sundarī, the daughter of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the birth and marriage of Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>and Aśokasundarī in Padma Purāṇa as given below:
<div n="NI"/>Once Śiva and Pārvatī were engaged in love-making in
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa. Pārvatī requested Śiva to show her the best
<div n="lb"/>garden ever created by Brahmā. Śiva took her to
<div n="lb"/>Nandanavana, where she saw the Kalpa tree, which
<div n="lb"/>was beautiful all over, and she asked Śiva about its
<div n="lb"/>special features. Śiva replied that anything asked of it
<div n="lb"/>would be granted by the Kalpa tree. Pārvatī made a
<div n="lb"/>request to the Kalpa tree for a girl just for a test.
<div n="lb"/>Instantly a very beautiful girl was born from the tree.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī named her Aśokasundarī and brought her up as
<div n="lb"/>her daughter. Once Pārvatī gave her a boon that she
<div n="lb"/>would become the wife of King Nahuṣa of the Lunar
<div n="lb"/>family, who would be equal to Indra.
<div n="NI"/>One day, when the beautiful Aśokasundarī was walking
<div n="lb"/>with celestial maids in the Nandanavana an asura
<div n="lb"/>named Huṇḍa the son of Vipracitti, came there. The
<div n="lb"/>moment his eyes fell on Aśokasundarī he fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with her. The asura spoke to her of his love and re-
<div n="lb"/>quested her to be his wife. Not only did she refuse his
<div n="lb"/>request but also told him that according to the boon
<div n="lb"/>given by Pārvatī she would become the wife of Nahuṣa,
<div n="lb"/>the King of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Huṇḍa smiled and said: “That righteous
<div n="lb"/>man named Nahuṣa is yet to be born in the Lunar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. You will be much older than he. He will not suit
<div n="lb"/>you as he will be too young. So don't waste your blooming
<div n="lb"/>youth. Come and enjoy life with me.” But Aśokasundarī
<div n="lb"/>did not concede. Huṇḍa was disappointed. So he began
<div n="lb"/>to think about ways to get her. He disappeared from
<div n="lb"/>there and reappeared in the guise of a beautiful woman
[Page516-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and told Aśokasundarī thus:—“Lady, I have taken a
<div n="lb"/>fast. Huṇḍa has killed my husband. I am doing penance
<div n="lb"/>to curse him. You may come to my hermitage on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Gaṅgā”.
<div n="NI"/>Aśokasundarī believed these false words. She went with
<div n="lb"/>her. Both of them walked on and at last entered a
<div n="lb"/>palace. Then only did she understand that it was the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Huṇḍa, who assumed his original form and
<div n="lb"/>tried to violate her chastity. Aśokasundarī became angry
<div n="lb"/>and cursed Huṇḍa that he would die at the hands of
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa, and ran away to Kailāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Huṇḍa was sad for two reasons. On the one hand
<div n="lb"/>he did not get Aśokasundarī and on the other hand
<div n="lb"/>he had incurred the curse that Nahuṣa would be his
<div n="lb"/>slayer. Now what was the way to get out of the trouble?
<div n="lb"/>He asked his minister Kampana to take Indumatī the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Āyus by stealth and bring her to his palace. They
<div n="lb"/>decided to destroy Nahuṣa in the womb of Indumatī, in
<div n="lb"/>case it was not possible to carry her away. They waited
<div n="lb"/>for an opportunity.
<div n="NI"/>Āyus was an emperor of righteousness. After the marri-
<div n="lb"/>age, for a long time he was childless. Once he visited
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Dattātreya, in his hermitage. Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>who was the son of Atri and the most famous and
<div n="lb"/>the noblest of all the hermits, was quite senseless and
<div n="lb"/>red-eyed because of drinking, and without even the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmasūtra, was playing with a young woman,
<div n="lb"/>seating her in his lap. His body was besmeared with
<div n="lb"/>sandalwood and aloe and adorned with garlands and
<div n="lb"/>necklaces of pearl and he was surrounded by many
<div n="lb"/>women. The King seeing the divine hermit bowed
<div n="lb"/>him with reverence and fear. The moment the hermit
<div n="lb"/>saw the King, he sat in deep meditation. This continued
<div n="lb"/>for a hundred years, at the end of which period, seeing
<div n="lb"/>the devotion of the King, he said, “Oh King! why do
<div n="lb"/>you take this trouble. I have left off the customs and
<div n="lb"/>manners of Brahmins. I have no Brāhmaṇya (Brahmin-
<div n="lb"/>ism). I am immersed in liquor, meat and women. So
<div n="lb"/>you had better go and serve another Brahmin.”
<div n="NI"/>Āyus refuted all that the hermit said and requested him
<div n="lb"/>to bless him that he might get a son. Finally the hermit
<div n="lb"/>ordered the King to bring meat and liquor in a skull.
<div n="lb"/>The King obeyed him. Dattātreya was pleased at the
<div n="lb"/>devotion and willingness to serve as a disciple and told
<div n="lb"/>the King that a son would be born to him; that the
<div n="lb"/>son would be a worshipper of Devatīrthas (Holy baths),
<div n="lb"/>that he would not be defeated by devas, asuras, Kinnaras
<div n="lb"/>giants, and Kṣatriyas, that he would be the protector of
<div n="lb"/>his subjects and that he would be a great scholar in
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and Śāstras. Saying this he gave the King a
<div n="lb"/>fruit to be given to his wife. The King returned to his
<div n="lb"/>palace.
<div n="NI"/>The King gave the fruit to his wife Indumatī. She ate
<div n="lb"/>it and became pregnant. One night she gave birth to a
<div n="lb"/>son. When the servant-maid went out of the room of
<div n="lb"/>confinement Huṇḍa entered into her body and went
<div n="lb"/>in. When all were asleep he took the child and ran to
<div n="lb"/>his palace at Kāñcanapura. He gave the child to his
<div n="lb"/>wife Vipulā and asked her to make a sauce of the child
<div n="lb"/>for him. Vipulā gave the child to the servant woman to
<div n="lb"/>cook it. With the aid of the cook she hid the child and
<div n="lb"/>prepared a sauce with some other flesh. The cook took
<div n="lb"/>the child to the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha and placed it at
<div n="lb"/>the door of the hermitage, in the night. At dawn
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha came out of the hermitage and seeing the
[Page516-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>child took it, named it Nahuṣa and brought him up.
<div n="lb"/>The King and his wife Indumatī cried for a long time
<div n="lb"/>over the loss of the child. At that time Nārada came
<div n="lb"/>there and told them that their son would return
<div n="lb"/>soon.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nahuṣa was bringing Samits (butea-fuel) when
<div n="lb"/>he heard some devacāraṇas (heavenly singers) saying
<div n="lb"/>among themselves the history of Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa heard
<div n="lb"/>it. He told Vasiṣṭha all that he had heard. Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>told him all the stories from the beginning to his being
<div n="lb"/>kidnapped by Huṇḍa. Nahuṣa was amazed at what
<div n="lb"/>he heard. He wanted to kill Huṇḍa instantly. So he
<div n="lb"/>bowed before Vasiṣṭha and taking bow and arrow went
<div n="lb"/>away to kill Huṇḍa.
<div n="NI"/>Believing that he had eaten Nahuṣa, Huṇḍa approached
<div n="lb"/>Aśokasundarī again and told her that he had actually
<div n="lb"/>eaten Nahuṣa. Aśokasundarī felt very sad when she
<div n="lb"/>heard this. At that time a Kinnara named Vidyuddhara
<div n="lb"/>and his wife came there. They consoled Aśokasundarī
<div n="lb"/>and told her that Nahuṣa was alive. He continued.
<div n="NI"/>“Oh beautiful lady, that great sage will kill Huṇḍā-
<div n="lb"/>sura and marry you, and live with you as an emperor
<div n="lb"/>in this world, as Śakra (Indra) in heaven. From Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>will be born to you a son named Yayāti, who will be
<div n="lb"/>righteous, kind and loving towards his subjects and
<div n="lb"/>equal to Indra, and a hundred daughters who would
<div n="lb"/>be exceedingly beautiful and of very fine character. Then
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa will go to heaven and become Devendra.
<div n="lb"/>At that time your son Yayāti will be the emperor and
<div n="lb"/>will rule his subjects with kindness. Four sons, who
<div n="lb"/>would possess prowess and valour, who would be second
<div n="lb"/>to none in archery will be born to him. They will be
<div n="lb"/>known by the names Turvasu, Puru, Kuru and Yadu.
<div n="lb"/>Powerful and mighty sons called Bhoja, Bhīma,
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka, Kukkura, Vṛṣṇi, Śrutasena, Srutadhāra and
<div n="lb"/>Kāladaṃṣṭra will be born to Yadu. They will become
<div n="lb"/>famous by the name Yādavas. Several sons will be born
<div n="lb"/>to them. Thus the family of Nahuṣa and yourself will
<div n="lb"/>increase.”
<div n="NI"/>By this time Nahuṣa had arrived at the spot fully armed
<div n="lb"/>and ready to fight Huṇḍa, who was killed in the terrible
<div n="lb"/>battle which ensued. Nahuṣa married Aśokasundarī in
<div n="lb"/>the midst of devas and after the marriage the couple
<div n="lb"/>reached the palace of Nahuṣa. (Padma Purāṇa, fifteen
<div n="lb"/>chapters from 102).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nahuṣa became Indra.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%Became a python by the curse of Agastya.%} To get remission
<div n="lb"/>from the sin of Brahmahatyā, incurred by killing Vṛtrā-
<div n="lb"/>sura, Indra hid himself in a cluster lotuses in the Mānasa
<div n="lb"/>lake. The devas who were worried due to the absence
<div n="lb"/>of Indra, elected Nahuṣa as Indra temporarily. Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>wanted to get Indrāṇī. Agastya cursed Nahuṣa and
<div n="lb"/>changed him to a python. At the sight of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>he regained his original form and went back to the
<div n="lb"/>world of Indra. (For detailed story see under
<div n="lb"/>Agastya).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Nahuṣa had six sons Yati, Yayāti, Saṃyāti, Āyati,
<div n="lb"/>Ayati and Dhruva. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 75,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 30).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Nahuṣa was allowed to enter heaven because he
