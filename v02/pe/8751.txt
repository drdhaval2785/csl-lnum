YĀTUDHĀNĪ¦. A Rākṣasī who was born from the sacrifi-
<div n="lb"/>cial fire when King Vṛṣādarbhi performed a yāga. As
<div n="lb"/>directed by the king, she proceeded to the forest to des-
<div n="lb"/>troy the Saptarṣis. She remained there as the owner of
<div n="lb"/>the tank in which the sages used to take bath. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>her standing alone there, they enquired who she was.
<div n="lb"/>She answered that she was guarding the tank. She allow-
<div n="lb"/>ed them to enter into the tank after each of them explain-
<div n="lb"/>ed the meaning of his name. Accordingly, the sages
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, Viśvāmitra, Gautama and
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja explained the meaning of their names be-
<div n="lb"/>fore getting down into the tank. At last when sage
<div n="lb"/>Śunassakha's turn came, he said that he was not pre-
<div n="lb"/>pared to explain in detail, the meaning of his name and
<div n="lb"/>that she should be satisfied with his statement that he
<div n="lb"/>was the sage Śunassakha. Yātudhānī became angry on
<div n="lb"/>hearing it and insisted on his giving the meaning of his
<div n="lb"/>name. Śunassakha with a single stroke with his
<div n="lb"/>“tridaṇḍa” (trident) killed her. Śunassakha was really
<div n="lb"/>Indra himself. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 93).
