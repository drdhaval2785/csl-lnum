ŚĀNTI V¦. A maharṣi who was a disciple of the Ṛṣi called
<div n="lb"/>Bhūti, who did once go to participate in a yajña con-
<div n="lb"/>ducted by his brother Suvarccas, leaving matters con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with his āśrama with Śānti, who discharged his
<div n="lb"/>duties quite well in the absence of his master. One day
<div n="lb"/>when agni became very scarce in the āśrama he praised
<div n="lb"/>Agnideva, and noticing that the Deva was pleased
<div n="lb"/>Śānti requested him to bestow a son on the maharṣi.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly a son was born to Bhūti, who later on be-
<div n="lb"/>came famous as ‘Bhautyamanu.’ Bhūti, who was pleased
<div n="lb"/>with the devout life of his disciple (Śānti) taught him
<div n="lb"/>Sāṅgaveda. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
