NĀGĀSTRA¦. A destructive weapon (arrow). The
<div n="lb"/>following story about the astra is told in the Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>In olden times there was a very powerful and mean
<div n="lb"/>asura called Nāga. Brahmā resorted to virulent black
<div n="lb"/>magic to kill Nāga, and from the fire-pit arose a terri-
<div n="lb"/>ble goblin called Nāgapāśa. It was deputed to kill
<div n="lb"/>Nāga and the Trimūrtis followed it. Nāgapāśa went
<div n="lb"/>to the city of Nāgāsura called Vīramahendra, ascended
<div n="lb"/>its tower and made a terrible noise the echo of which
<div n="lb"/>caused abortion in all the pregnant nāga women. Many
<div n="lb"/>children fainted and many died. Nāgāsura deputed his
<div n="lb"/>army chieftain Vīrasena with an army to kill the nāga
<div n="lb"/>goblin. At the sight of the army the goblin raised
<div n="lb"/>another terrible cry, which blew off Vīrasena and his
<div n="lb"/>army, reducing them to powder. Then Nāgāsura's
<div n="lb"/>minister with a big army attacked the goblin. But the
<div n="lb"/>minister was devoured by him, and the army annihilated.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this defeat of his minister, Nāgāsura attack-
<div n="lb"/>ed the goblin with an army of crores of soldiers. But,
<div n="lb"/>within seconds the goblin devoured the mighty army.
<div n="lb"/>At last Nāgapāśa and Nāgāsura engaged themselves in
<div n="lb"/>a duel which lasted for years. Ultimately the goblin
<div n="lb"/>swallowed up Nāgāsura also. Then he went to the
<div n="lb"/>Trimūrtis and saluted them. They granted him many
<div n="lb"/>boons, and Śiva, in excess of joy, wore it as one of the
<div n="lb"/>ornaments round his neck. Some time later Nāgapāśa
<div n="lb"/>set out on a tour to see the fourteen worlds, and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>specially instructed him not to visit the Śālmali island.
<div n="lb"/>He visited the various worlds earning all knowledge
<div n="lb"/>and started for mount Kailāsa. On his way he saw
<div n="lb"/>Śālmali island, the abode of nāgas, and in violation of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's instructions, he entered the island. The nāgas
<div n="lb"/>there did not honour him and his false pride made him
<div n="lb"/>tremble with rage. Then the nāgas of the island told
<div n="lb"/>him thus: “We have a powerful enemy, who visits us
<div n="lb"/>every month, and unless we feed him sumptuously he
<div n="lb"/>will devour all of us for food He is to come today, and
<div n="lb"/>if you are capable enough, you defeat and drive him
<div n="lb"/>off and save us. If you do so, we shall crown you as our
<div n="lb"/>King and honour you.”
<div n="NI"/>The powerful enemy of the nāgas was Garuḍa and he
<div n="lb"/>came. All the nāgas ran off at his sight. Garuḍa then
<div n="lb"/>attacked the goblin Nāgapāśa, who was standing un-
<div n="lb"/>perturbed before him. There being no chance of vic-
<div n="lb"/>tory for the goblin he ran away and took refuge with
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Garuḍa also followed him, and demanded of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva to return to him, his enemy, the goblin. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>told Garuḍa thus:—“If, in future he (the goblin)
<div n="lb"/>interferes with anybody connected with you, you may
<div n="lb"/>either punish or eat him. Do not do anything with him
<div n="lb"/>now”.
<div n="NI"/>Garuḍa agreed to the above proposal of Śiva. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards Nāgapāśa lived in Vaikuṇṭha en-
<div n="lb"/>twined with nooses. He became the arrow called nāga-
<div n="lb"/>pāśa or nāgāstra.
