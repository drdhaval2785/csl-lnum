VIDHAVĀ¦ A woman whose husband is dead. In
<div n="lb"/>ancient India, it was ordained how a widow should
<div n="lb"/>live. It was allowed for a widow to get a son by her
<div n="lb"/>younger brother-in law to continue the family line in
<div n="lb"/>case the death of her husband occurred before the
<div n="lb"/>couple had children. The procedure about this is
<div n="lb"/>given in Manusmṛti, Chapter 9.
<div n="NI"/>“He who goes to accept the widow with the permission
<div n="lb"/>of great people, should besmear his body with ghee and
<div n="lb"/>go to her bed in the night in a dark room. She should
<div n="lb"/>have only one son in this manner. After she has become
<div n="lb"/>pregnant, they should behave to each other as a
<div n="lb"/>teacher and a younger brother-in-law.”
