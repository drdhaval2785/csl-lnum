JĪMŪTAKETU I¦. A synonym of Śiva. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas about how Śiva got the name Jīmūta-
<div n="lb"/>ketu.
<div n="NI"/>When summer season began Pārvatī told her husband
<div n="lb"/>Śiva: “My Lord, Summer has set in. What are we to
<div n="lb"/>do without a house to protect us from the hot sun and
<div n="lb"/>the strong wind?” Śiva replied. “Dear! It is because
<div n="lb"/>I have no house that I walk about in the forest
<div n="lb"/>always.”
<div n="NI"/>Because Śiva said so, the loyal wife Satīdevī spent the
<div n="lb"/>summer with her husband in the shade of trees. When
<div n="lb"/>the summer was over rainy season began. People stopp-
<div n="lb"/>ed walking about. The sky became black with clouds.
<div n="lb"/>The roaring sound of thunder was heard everywhere.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing that the rainy season had begun Pārvatī again
<div n="lb"/>request her husband to erect a house. Hearing her
<div n="lb"/>request Śiva replied. “I have no wealth at all to build
<div n="lb"/>a house. You see that I am wearing the hide of a leo-
<div n="lb"/>pard. The serpent Śeṣa is my Brāhma-string. Padma
<div n="lb"/>and Piṅgala are my ear-rings. One of my bracelets for
<div n="lb"/>the upper arm is Kambala and the other one is the
<div n="lb"/>nāga (serpent) Dhanañjaya. My bracelet on the right
<div n="lb"/>hand is Aśvatara and on the left hand is Takṣaka. The
<div n="lb"/>string that I wear round my waist is Nīla, as black as
<div n="lb"/>antimony. So let us go above the clouds and spend the
<div n="lb"/>rainy season there. Then rain will not fall on your
<div n="lb"/>body.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying thus, Śiva got into a lofty cloud with Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>and sat there. That cloud looked like the flag of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Thenceforward Śiva came to be known by the name
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtaketu. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter).
