SVĀYAMBHUVA¦ MANU. Son of Brahmā and the
<div n="lb"/>first of the Manus.
[Page779-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Svāyambhuva Manu was born as the
<div n="lb"/>mental son, and Śatarūpā as the mental daughter, of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Svāyambhuva did penance and acquired
<div n="lb"/>boons for ruling over the subjects. He married
<div n="lb"/>Śatarūpā herself. Brahmā appointed him as the
<div n="lb"/>first Manu to rule over the subjects. Two sons named
<div n="lb"/>Priyavrata and Uttānapāda and two daughters named
<div n="lb"/>Prasūti and Ākūti, were born to Svāyambhuva by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Śatarūpā. Of the two daughters Prasūti was
<div n="lb"/>given to Prajāpati Dakṣa and Ākūti to Prajāpati
<div n="lb"/>Ruci as wives. A son named Yajña and a daughter
<div n="lb"/>named Dakṣiṇā were born to Ruci by Ākūti. The
<div n="lb"/>children were twins.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that Svāyambhuva and Śatarūpā are
<div n="lb"/>the first human beings. A story as given below,
<div n="lb"/>occurs in Matsya Purāṇa. Brahmā took birth as a
<div n="lb"/>man somewhere in Kāśmīra. Brahmā who took birth
<div n="lb"/>as man, created Śatarūpā from his own body, with-
<div n="lb"/>out any decrease in its radiance. Svāyambhuva
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmā) appreciated the beauty of Śatarūpā. He
<div n="lb"/>grew amorous. But Brahmā was ashamed of his
<div n="lb"/>feeling, as Śatarūpā being half of his body, was his
<div n="lb"/>daughter. Being subjected to love and shame at the
<div n="lb"/>same time Svāyambhuva stood there, looking at
<div n="lb"/>Śatarūpā. To avoid the look of Brahmā, Satarūpā
<div n="lb"/>moved to one side. Brahmā had no courage to turn
<div n="lb"/>his face to that side. So another face sprang up
<div n="lb"/>on that side for him. Śatarūpā turned to four sides
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmā thus got four faces. His amour subsided.
<div n="lb"/>When the desire subsided, a man originated from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. That man is Svāyambhuva. (For further
<div n="lb"/>details see under Manvantara).
