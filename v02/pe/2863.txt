JANALOKA¦. One of the fourteen worlds. This world is
<div n="lb"/>situated three crores of yojanas (leagues) away from
<div n="lb"/>Dhruvapada (the region of Dhruva—Pole star) according
<div n="lb"/>to Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa II, Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>JANAMEJAYA I. A famous King of the Solar dynasty

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth, marriage and accession to throne.%} Janamejaya
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Parīkṣit by his wife Madravatī. Vapu-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭamā, daughter of Suvarṇavarman, King of Kāśī was
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya's wife. Two sons, Śatānīka and Śaṅku-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa were born to them. Janamejaya had three
<div n="lb"/>brothers called Śrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 2nd Skandha; Ādi Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>3 and 95).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Death of his father.%} Janamejaya's father, Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>ruled the country in a very distinguished manner for
<div n="lb"/>sixty years. While once hunting in the forest Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>became very tired and thirsty. While searching for
<div n="lb"/>water he came across a Sage named Śamīka and asked
<div n="lb"/>him for some water. Śamīka being engaged in medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion did not hear the King's request. But, the
[Page346-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>King mistaking the sage's silence for haughtiness threw
<div n="lb"/>in anger a dead snake round his neck and went away.
<div n="lb"/>But, within seven days of the incident Parīkṣit was
<div n="lb"/>bitten to death by Takṣaka, king of the Nāgas accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the curse pronounced on him by Gavijāta,
<div n="lb"/>son of sage Śamīka.
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya was only an infant at the time of his
<div n="lb"/>father's death. So the obsequies of the late king were
<div n="lb"/>performed by his ministers. After that at an auspicious
<div n="lb"/>time Janamejaya was crowned King. Within a short
<div n="lb"/>time he mastered statecraft. Dhanurvidyā was taught
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛpācārya. Very soon he earned reputation as an
<div n="lb"/>efficient administrator. He got married in due course.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 2nd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%His hatred towards snakes.%} In the course of a talk
<div n="lb"/>one day with Janamejaya Uttaṅka the sage detailed to
<div n="lb"/>him the circumstances of his father's death. Only
<div n="lb"/>then did he understand the actual cause of Parīkṣit's
<div n="lb"/>death, and the information kindled in him intense
<div n="lb"/>feelings of revenge not only against serpents but also
<div n="lb"/>against the whole serpent dynasty. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>2nd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Sarpasatra. (Serpent yajña).%} Janamejaya sought
<div n="lb"/>the advice of priests and Ṛtviks as to how best revenge
<div n="lb"/>could be taken against the serpents, and they advised
<div n="lb"/>him to perform the great Yajña called Sarpasatra.
<div n="lb"/>And, accordingly all necessary arrangements for the
<div n="lb"/>Satra were made, and the King began dīkṣā (Initiation)
<div n="lb"/>for it (to live for a few days under severe routine to
<div n="lb"/>prepare the author of the yajña for it). But the priest
<div n="lb"/>who made the arrangements looked into signs about the
<div n="lb"/>successful conclusion of the yajña and opined that it
<div n="lb"/>would be obstructed by a brahmin, and, the King,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, ordered strict steps to be taken against the
<div n="lb"/>entry of strangers into the Yāgaśālā.
<div n="NI"/>And, the Sarpasatra began. High priests wore black
<div n="lb"/>clothes, and chanting mantras they made offerings in
<div n="lb"/>the sacred fire, and this created a burning sensation in
<div n="lb"/>the hearts of serpents. They began, one after another
<div n="lb"/>to come and fall into the fire. All varieties of serpents
<div n="lb"/>got consumed by the fire thus.
<div n="NI"/>Sages like Uttaṅka, Caṇḍabhārgava, Śārṅgarava, Vyāsa,
<div n="lb"/>Uddālaka, Ātreya, Pramataka, Śvetaketu, Nārada,
<div n="lb"/>Devala, Kālaghaṭa, Śrutaśravas, Kohala, Devaśarman,
<div n="lb"/>Maudgalya and Samasaurabha acted as Ṛtviks at the
<div n="lb"/>Satra. Though almost all the serpents courted death in
<div n="lb"/>the fire, Takṣaka alone did not come. Fear-stricken he
<div n="lb"/>had taken refuge with Indra.
<div n="NI"/>As the chanting of mantras increased in intensity and
<div n="lb"/>volume Vāsuki began to feel the burning sensation. He
<div n="lb"/>requested his sister Jaratkāru to find out some means
<div n="lb"/>of escape from the Satra, and at the instance of Jarat-
<div n="lb"/>kāru her son Āstīka set out for the palace of Janame-
<div n="lb"/>jaya to obstruct the Yajña.
<div n="NI"/>Though the Ṛtviks invoked for a long time Takṣaka did
<div n="lb"/>not appear. Enraged at his absence, Uttaṅka searched
<div n="lb"/>for Takṣaka with his divine eyes and found him seated
<div n="lb"/>on the throne of Indra along with him, who had given
<div n="lb"/>him (Takṣaka) asylum. This challenge of Indra kindled
<div n="lb"/>the wrath of Uttaṅka all the more, and he invoked
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Takṣaka and Indra's throne too so that all of
<div n="lb"/>them might together come and fall into the fire. And,
<div n="lb"/>lo! there came the whole lot of them. Only two minutes
<div n="lb"/>more and all of them would be reduced to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>By now Āstīka, the son of Jaratkāru had arrived at the
[Page346-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Yajña śālā. Janamejaya received the young Sage with
<div n="lb"/>all respect and promised to grant his desire what-
<div n="lb"/>ever that be. Āstīka's demand was that the Sarpa Satra
<div n="lb"/>should be stopped. Though Janamejaya was not for
<div n="lb"/>stopping the yajña, he was reminded of his promise to
<div n="lb"/>grant any desire of Āstīka and the latter insisted on the
<div n="lb"/>stopping of the Satra. Janamejaya stopped it. Āstīka
<div n="lb"/>blessed that the serpents which had died at the Satra
<div n="lb"/>would attain salvation. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 52-58;
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata, 2nd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Listens to the Bhārata story.%} While the Sarpa Śatra
<div n="lb"/>was being conducted Vyāsa came over there and related
<div n="lb"/>the whole story of the Mahābhārata at the request of
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 60).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Saramā's curse.%} Janamejaya along with his brother
<div n="lb"/>once performed a yajña of long duration at Kurukṣetra.
<div n="lb"/>While the yajña was going on, a dog (son of Saramā
<div n="lb"/>the bitch of the Devas) came there. The three brothers
<div n="lb"/>of Janamejaya beat the dog which returned to its
<div n="lb"/>mother, Saramā, crying. The mother asked him whe-
<div n="lb"/>ther he had done anything to deserve the beating, and
<div n="lb"/>he answered thus: “No, mother, I had done nothing
<div n="lb"/>wrong. I did not lick the havis, nor did I even look at
<div n="lb"/>it.” Hearing her son's reply Saramā in deep anguish,
<div n="lb"/>went to Kurukṣetra and questioned Janamejaya as to
<div n="lb"/>why her innocent son was beaten by his brothers. Nei-
<div n="lb"/>ther he nor his brothers replied to Saramā, and she
<div n="lb"/>cursed Janamejaya that he would be subjected to
<div n="lb"/>adṛṣṭaphala (unforeseen results). This curse upset
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya so much that after the Sarpa Satra was
<div n="lb"/>over and on his return to Hastināpura he made a search
<div n="lb"/>for a Purohita (priest) competent enough to redeem
<div n="lb"/>him from his sins, and at last he invited Somaśravas,
<div n="lb"/>son of the great sage Śrutaśravas to be his Purohita, and
<div n="lb"/>thus did Somaśravas become the priest of Janamejaya
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Successors of Janamejaya.%} Janamejaya had two sons,
<div n="lb"/>Candrāpīḍa and Suryāpīḍa by his wife Kāśyā. Hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons, experts in archery, were born to Candrāpīḍa. The
<div n="lb"/>eldest of them, Satyakarṇa, ruled the country after Jana-
<div n="lb"/>mejaya. Satyakarṇa had a son called Śvetakarṇa to
<div n="lb"/>whom was born a son called Ajapārśva by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Yādavī, the daughter of Sucāru. (Bhaviṣya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other Information%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Janamejaya defeated the King of Takṣaśilā and sub-
<div n="lb"/>jugated the country. Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The Sage called Veda was the preceptor of Jana-
<div n="lb"/>mejaya. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 82).
<div n="NI"/>(3) After the Sarpa Satra, Janamejaya performed an
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha yajña at which Vyāsa delivered a lengthy
<div n="lb"/>discourse on life and salvation. As Janamejaya said
<div n="lb"/>that if he were to believe the words of Vyāsa his dead
<div n="lb"/>father Parīkṣit should be shown to him. Vyāsa brought
<div n="lb"/>Parīkṣit down from Svarga and showed him to his son.
<div n="lb"/>On the occasion were also present sage Śamīka and
<div n="lb"/>his son Śṛṅgī. (Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 35)
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Life time of Janamejaya.%} The great war at Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra was fought in 3138 B.C. (See under Mahābhārata)
<div n="lb"/>After the war was over the Pāṇḍavas ruled the country
<div n="lb"/>for 36 years. Vyāsa took three years to compose the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata. According to the Mahāprasthānika Parva
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas set out for the forest after handing over
<div n="lb"/>the government to Parīkṣit, who ruled the country for
[Page347-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sixty years. From the above facts it becomes evident
<div n="lb"/>that Janamejaya became king in 3042 B.C.
