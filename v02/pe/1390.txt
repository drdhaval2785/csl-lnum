CAKRIKA¦. A forest hunter. The following story is
<div n="lb"/>told about him in Chapter 16, Kriyāyoga of the Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Devoted much to his parents, Cakrika was a great
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Viṣṇu. He used to worship Viṣṇu daily with
<div n="lb"/>fruits, (edible) roots etc. But, he did so only after
<div n="lb"/>himself tasting them. One day while thus tasting a
<div n="lb"/>fruit, somehow or other it got itself lodged in his
<div n="lb"/>throat, and all his attempts to dislodge it failed. The
<div n="lb"/>fruit had to be, at any rate, offered to Viṣṇu and there-
<div n="lb"/>fore Cakrika drew his sword and cut his throat with it.
<div n="lb"/>Lord Viṣṇu who was so pleased at such great devotion
<div n="lb"/>of the man appeared on the scene and brought him
<div n="lb"/>back to life. Sometime afterwards Cakrika expired at
<div n="lb"/>the Dvārakā temple, and thus attained salvation.
