ASIPATRAVANA¦. One of the notorious twentyeight
<div n="lb"/>hells. If you destroy forests without purpose you will go
<div n="lb"/>to this hell. (Chapter 6, Anuśāsana Parva 2, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa). The Devī Bhāgavata describes Asipatravana
<div n="lb"/>like this: “Those who forsake their own natural duty
<div n="lb"/>and go in for that of others are thrown into this hell;
<div n="lb"/>they die by the orderlies of Yama, the King of Death.
<div n="lb"/>There they will be whipped by a whip made of thorny
<div n="lb"/>herbs and as they run about with pain they will be
<div n="lb"/>followed and whipped. Crashing against the big stones
<div n="lb"/>there they will fall fainting and the moment they wake
<div n="lb"/>up from the faint they will be stabbed again. This
<div n="lb"/>will be repeated. (Aṣṭama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
