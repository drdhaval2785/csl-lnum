GUṆAVARĀ¦. A heroine, devoted to her husband, in
<div n="lb"/>the ancient literature of India. There is a story in
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara describing the depth of her devotion
<div n="lb"/>to her husband.
<div n="NI"/>Guṇavarā was the queen of Vīrabhuja, King of the
<div n="lb"/>country of Vardhamāna. He had besides Guṇavarā
<div n="lb"/>ninetynine other wives. But none had any children. So,
<div n="lb"/>the King asked the chief physician of the state to
<div n="lb"/>suggest a way to remedy this. The physician asked for
<div n="lb"/>a white and horned goat to be brought and he then
<div n="lb"/>made with its flesh a preparation. Then sprinkling
<div n="lb"/>over it a special medicinal dust, he gave it to the wives
<div n="lb"/>to eat. But Guṇavarā who never left her husband for
<div n="lb"/>a moment came late to take the preparation and by the
<div n="lb"/>time she came the others had already consumed the whole
<div n="lb"/>lot. Then by an order of the King the horns of the
<div n="lb"/>goat were made into a similar preparation and
<div n="lb"/>Guṇavarā took it with the dust sprinkled over it. All
<div n="lb"/>the wives got a child each. Guṇavarā's son was named
<div n="lb"/>Śṛṅgabhuja.
<div n="NI"/>All the other wives of Vīrabhuja became jealous of
<div n="lb"/>Guṇavarā. They told the King that Guṇavarā was in
<div n="lb"/>love with a servant of the palace. The King did not
<div n="lb"/>believe it. But he thought he would test her. The King
<div n="lb"/>called the servant in question and accusing him of
<div n="lb"/>having committed the murder of a brahmin sent him
<div n="lb"/>away from the state on a pilgrimage. Sorrow-stricken
<div n="lb"/>the servant set out for the pilgrimage. The King then
<div n="lb"/>approached Guṇavarā and said that a sannyāsin had
<div n="lb"/>declared that he, the King, would lose his crown if one
<div n="lb"/>of his wives was not put in a cell underground.
<div n="lb"/>Guṇavarā who adored her husband readily agreed to
<div n="lb"/>live underground.
<div n="NI"/>The other wives were satisfied and yet they wanted to
<div n="lb"/>send away her son, Śṛṅgabhuja also from the palace.
<div n="lb"/>One day when all the children were playing in the
<div n="lb"/>court-yard a stork came and sat perched on the top of
<div n="lb"/>the palace. The princes attempted to catch hold of it.
<div n="lb"/>A sannyāsin who came there then informed the children
<div n="lb"/>that the stork was none other than Agniśikha, a demon,
<div n="lb"/>who had come there to capture and take away the
<div n="lb"/>children. All the children then tried to drop it down
<div n="lb"/>by arrows. But none succeeded. Then Śṛṅgabhuja took
<div n="lb"/>a golden arrow from the palace and sent it against the
<div n="lb"/>bird. The arrow struck the demon but the bird flew
<div n="lb"/>away carrying the golden arrow.
<div n="NI"/>The other princes found it as an opportunity to rebuke
<div n="lb"/>Śṛṅgabhuja and they, led by Nirvāsabhuja, reproached
<div n="lb"/>him for losing the golden arrow. Unable to bear their
<div n="lb"/>insult Śṛṅgabhuja went after the stork following the
<div n="lb"/>path of the blood drops which fell on the ground from
<div n="lb"/>the wound. At last he reached Dhūmapura, the land of
<div n="lb"/>Agniśikha. There he fell in love with Rūpaśikhā, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Agniśikha. They were soon married and
<div n="lb"/>yet Agniśikha gave Śṛṅgabhuja great trouble. At last
<div n="lb"/>Śṛṅgabhuja and Rūpaśikhā took the golden arrow and
<div n="lb"/>eloped from the place one night and reached the city of
<div n="lb"/>Vardhamāna. Agniśikha followed them but the magic
<div n="lb"/>powers of Rūpaśikhā made him turn back. When King
<div n="lb"/>Vīrabhuja saw his son Śṛṅgabhuja he was extremely
<div n="lb"/>happy. The King then released Guṇavarā from the
<div n="lb"/>dungeon and praised her for her devotion to her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band. He loved her more and treated her with greater
[Page304-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>affection than before. At that time the servant who had
<div n="lb"/>been sent away also returned. (Taraṅga 5, Ratnapra-
<div n="lb"/>bhālaṃbaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
