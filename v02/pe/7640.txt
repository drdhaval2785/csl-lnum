TUṢĀRA¦. A place of habitation of ancient Bhārata.
<div n="lb"/>Scholars are of opinion that the present Tukhāristan
<div n="lb"/>was the ancient Tuṣāra. The people of this place used
<div n="lb"/>to be called Tuṣāras and their King Tuṣāra. The King
<div n="lb"/>of Tuṣāra was the store-keeper during the Rājasūyayajña
<div n="lb"/>of Yudhiṣṭhira, (Chapter 51, Vana Parva). The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas during their exile crossed this country of
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣāra on their way to Dvaitavana from the mountain
<div n="lb"/>of Gandhamādana. During the great battle, the Tuṣā-
<div n="lb"/>ras arrayed themselves on the right side of the Krauñca
<div n="lb"/>Vyūha (an army formation in the shape of a stork)
<div n="lb"/>constructed by Bhīṣma. (Śloka 21, Chapter 75, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva). There is a statement in Chapter 65 of Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva that a barbarous tribe called Tuṣāras lived in
<div n="lb"/>the country of Māndhātā.
