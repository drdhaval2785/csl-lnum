KUṬṬĀLA¦ (M). Seat of a famous Śiva temple in
<div n="lb"/>South India, originally a Viṣṇu temple. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story about its conversion into the present Śiva temple
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Agastya, on his journey to the south, reached Tirukku-
<div n="lb"/>tralam (Kuṭṭālam) in the Tirunelveli Zilla on the
<div n="lb"/>southern borders of Tamil Nadu. The temple there was
<div n="lb"/>dedicated to Viṣṇu, and the Vaiṣṇavas (devotees of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu) prevented Agastya from entering the temple
<div n="lb"/>with ashes on his forehead. At once he transformed
<div n="lb"/>himself into a devotee of Viṣṇu, and was permitted
<div n="lb"/>entry into the temple. As Viṣṇu wanted to show the
[Page448-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>world that he and Śiva were one and the same,
<div n="lb"/>and also the greatness of Agastya, the idol of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was all on a sudden changed into a Śiva Liṅga. Since
<div n="lb"/>then the temple has remained a Śiva Temple.
