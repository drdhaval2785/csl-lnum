GADĀVASĀNA¦. A particular centre in Madhurāpurī.
<div n="lb"/>The name owes its origin to the following reason. When
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa, his father-in-law Jarāsandha got
<div n="lb"/>so angry that he hurled his gadā (club) ninetynine
<div n="lb"/>times at Madhurāpurī from his capital, Girivraja. The
<div n="lb"/>spot where the gadā finally fell came to be called Gadā-
<div n="lb"/>vasāna in course of time. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>18, Verses 22-25).
