ṚCĪKA¦ I
<div n="NI"/>King Hariścandra who was distressed by having no
<div n="lb"/>children, propitiated god Varuṇa. Varuṇa blessed
<div n="lb"/>him saying that a son would be born to him. But
<div n="lb"/>the condition was that the child should be sacrificed
<div n="lb"/>to Varuṇa. When the child was born, Hariścandra did
<div n="lb"/>not like to sacrifice the boy. The sage Viśvāmitra suggest-
<div n="lb"/>ed that instead of sacrificing his own son it would be
<div n="lb"/>enough if he bought another boy and sacrificed him.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly, Hariścandra sent his minister to find out
<div n="lb"/>and purchase a Brahmin boy for the sacrifice. At that
<div n="lb"/>time there lived in Ayodhyā a greedy Brahmin named
<div n="lb"/>Ajīgarta. He had three sons. In the course of his search,
<div n="lb"/>the minister came across this needy Brahmin and asked
<div n="lb"/>him whether he was willing to sell one of his three sons.
<div n="lb"/>He continued: “Why should you be in this wretched
<div n="lb"/>state of poverty and misery? Sell one of your sons and
<div n="lb"/>you will get 100 cows as the price”. The minister's
<div n="lb"/>words and the price offered for the son made a deep
<div n="lb"/>impression on the Brahmin's mind. He thought:
<div n="lb"/>“It is impossible for me to earn 100 cows. Even if it were
<div n="lb"/>possible how long would it take? If I sell him I shall
<div n="lb"/>get hundred cows at once. What a lucky chance! The
<div n="lb"/>loss of a son is nothing.” So thinking, he sold his son
<div n="lb"/>Śunaśśepha. (For the rest of the story, see the word
<div n="lb"/>“Śunaśśepha”. Devī Bhāgavata, Skandhas 7, 8).
