CAMARA¦. (CAMARĪ). An animal whose tail is its most
<div n="lb"/>important and valued organ. In the course of its move-
<div n="lb"/>ments in the forest if the tail gets entangled anywhere
<div n="lb"/>it is supposed to lie down there till the tail is freed by
<div n="lb"/>itself. About the origin of Camara, the following story
<div n="lb"/>is told in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. Krodhavaśā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣaprajāpati and wife of Kaśyapa had ten daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ters, viz. Mṛgī, Mṛgamadā, Hari, Bhadramadā,
<div n="lb"/>Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetī, Surasā, Surabhi and Kadrū.
<div n="lb"/>To Mṛgamadā the Sṛmaras and Camaras owe their
<div n="lb"/>origin. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Canto 14).
