VIRŪPĀKṢA II¦. A Rākṣasa (giant) who fought on the
<div n="lb"/>side of Rāvaṇa against Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. It is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa that this giant was
<div n="lb"/>born to Mālyavān by a Gandharva damsel called Sun-
<div n="lb"/>darī. Seven sons named Vajramuṣṭi, Virūpākṣa, Durmu-
<div n="lb"/>kha, Suptaghna, Yajñakośa, Matta and Unmatta and a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Nalā were born to Mālyavān by Sun-
<div n="lb"/>darī.
<div n="NI"/>All these sons held prominent places in the army of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 10,
<div n="lb"/>that in the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, when
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa was killed, the army was commanded by
<div n="lb"/>Kumbha, Nikumbha, Makarākṣa, Mahodara, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>pārśva, Matta, Unmatta, Praghasa, Bhāsakarṇa, Virūpā-
<div n="lb"/>kṣa, Devāntaka, Narāntaka, Triśiras and Atikāya.
<div n="NI"/>When Sugrīva devastated the army of Rāvaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>caused havoc among the giants, Virūpākṣa, who was
<div n="lb"/>an archer got on an elephant and entered the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field. He confronted Sugrīva first. He thwarted the stone
<div n="lb"/>flung at him by Sugrīva, and struck him. For a time
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva found it difficult to withstand him. But in the
<div n="lb"/>battle which followed, Sugrīva struck Virūpākṣa down
<div n="lb"/>and killed him. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 97).
