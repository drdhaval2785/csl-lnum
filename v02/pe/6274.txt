ŚARALOMĀ¦. A maharṣi, the father of Dāśūra.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha once told Śrī Rāma the story of Dāśūra to
<div n="lb"/>prove that the world is all an illusion.
<div n="NI"/>Dāśūra was the only son of Śaralomā, a muni, who
<div n="lb"/>performed tapas in the plains of the mountain in
<div n="lb"/>Magadha. Dāśūra too did tapas in another part of
<div n="lb"/>the mountain. While the father and the son were
<div n="lb"/>living happily the father entered samādhi and the son
<div n="lb"/>wept over the loss of his father. Then a forest-nymph
<div n="lb"/>comforted him with celestial advice.
<div n="NI"/>Dāśūra performed his father's obsequies. He began
<div n="lb"/>thinking that the earth was impure and that the top of
<div n="lb"/>trees was pure and decided to do tapas in such a manner
<div n="lb"/>that he got power to sit on the branches and leaves of
<div n="lb"/>trees. Accordingly he made a big pit of fire and began
<div n="lb"/>making offerings of flesh cut from his body into the fire.
<div n="lb"/>Agnibhagavān (Fire-deity) appeared and asked him to
<div n="lb"/>choose the boons he wanted. Dāśūra told Agni as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “Oh Lord; I do not find any pure spot on this
<div n="lb"/>earth, which is full of created living beings. You should
<div n="lb"/>therefore, grant me the power to live on the tops of
<div n="lb"/>trees.” Agni granted him the boon.
<div n="NI"/>Dāśūra then climbed a big tree in the forest and occu-
<div n="lb"/>pied, without the least fear, a tender leaf at the top of
<div n="lb"/>the topmost branch of the tree. He there assumed the
<div n="lb"/>Padmāsana (the lotus seat for meditation). His mind
<div n="lb"/>was functioning actively as it had not been turned in-
<div n="lb"/>wards into true knowledge. With his mind in such a
<div n="lb"/>state he performed yajña. He continued performing
<div n="lb"/>yajñas like gomedha, a vamedha etc. mentally for ten
<div n="lb"/>years. Then self-illuminating knowledge arose in his
<div n="lb"/>mind. and he saw a beautiful forest-nymph seated
<div n="lb"/>beautifully attired at the end of the tender leaf on
<div n="lb"/>which he was sitting. She was looking very sad, her
<div n="lb"/>head bent down. Dāśūra asked her, who she was so
<div n="lb"/>much beautiful and attractive as to evoke love even in
<div n="lb"/>Kāma (the God of love). She answered him in a sweet
<div n="lb"/>voice as follows: “Very rare desires in life may be got if
<div n="lb"/>great men are requested for. I am the forest-nymph
<div n="lb"/>of this forest beautified by the tree you sit on and by
<div n="lb"/>trees and creepers equally beautiful. An assembly of the
<div n="lb"/>forest-nymphs has been held to celebrate a festival for
[Page693-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the worship of Kāmadeva on trayodasī in the śuklapakṣa
<div n="lb"/>of the month of Caitra. I too went there, and I, who
<div n="lb"/>am childless, felt sorry in mind to see the others petting
<div n="lb"/>their children on their laps. But, why should I be sad
<div n="lb"/>when you, who can give supplicants anything they wish
<div n="lb"/>for, are here? You should, therefore, bless me with a
<div n="lb"/>child or else I will end my life in fire.”
<div n="NI"/>Dāśūra blessed her to have a son within a month. He
<div n="lb"/>told her also that it would be difficult for the son to
<div n="lb"/>acquire knowledge as he was got on the insistence that
<div n="lb"/>she would die in fire unless she got him. He did not
<div n="lb"/>grant her request for permission to live with him; he
<div n="lb"/>went into the forests leaving her behind him.
<div n="NI"/>The son of the forest-nymph became twelve years old.
<div n="lb"/>Then, one day, she took the child to the muni; left it
<div n="lb"/>with him and went away. One day the father began
<div n="lb"/>telling the son a story, on the top of the tree, and
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, who was going by the sky in invisible form
<div n="lb"/>to bathe in Kailāsagaṅgā, heard the story. Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>hid himself on the tree and listened to the story.
<div n="NI"/>It was the story of king Svottha that the muni was tell-
<div n="lb"/>ing his son as follows:—“He was famous for his noble
<div n="lb"/>qualities and unique prowess. He possessed three bodies,
<div n="lb"/>which possessed capacity to rule the country. One of
<div n="lb"/>the three bodies was the best, the other midway between
<div n="lb"/>good and bad and the third bad. The very origin of
<div n="lb"/>the King was in the wide and extensive sky; like birds
<div n="lb"/>he lived in the sky. He built a city in the sky with
<div n="lb"/>fourteen streets and three divisions or sectors. There
<div n="lb"/>were also forests, woods and mountains for games in
<div n="lb"/>the city; seven big tanks, wavy-white with creepers of
<div n="lb"/>pearl and two lamps, spreading heat and coolness,
<div n="lb"/>burning always. The King, who went about all his time
<div n="lb"/>in this vast city, built in it many movable inner dwell-
<div n="lb"/>ings, and they were divided between the upper and
<div n="lb"/>lower parts of the city. They were thatched with a
<div n="lb"/>kind of black grass. Each inner house had nine doors,
<div n="lb"/>some of them windows, which admitted air always. In
<div n="lb"/>each house five lamps burned, the lamps resting on three
<div n="lb"/>pillars and a white piece of wood. Each house was
<div n="lb"/>glitteringly plastered and had courtyards. A particular
<div n="lb"/>sect of bhūtas, who ever feared light, guarded the
<div n="lb"/>houses. When the houses created thus by magic moved
<div n="lb"/>from one place to another, King Svottha enjoyed, like
<div n="lb"/>birds in nests, playing various games therein. The
<div n="lb"/>king, who possessed three bodies, used to go out
<div n="lb"/>after playing for some time with the guards, and run
<div n="lb"/>about like one possessed of a desire to occupy houses,
<div n="lb"/>newly built, and then reach the city, which was like a
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva city. Frail and unsettled in mind, the king,
<div n="lb"/>off and on, developed a will to die, and accordingly he
<div n="lb"/>died. Just as waves come up in the sea, the king used
<div n="lb"/>to be born again from the sky and to attend to worldly
<div n="lb"/>affairs. At times he used to repent about and weep over
<div n="lb"/>his actions asking himself what he, the fool, was doing
<div n="lb"/>and why he should be sad like that. At other times he
<div n="lb"/>used to feel elated and enthusiastic. Briefly put, he
<div n="lb"/>used to be, by turns drinking, walking, jumping, expand-
<div n="lb"/>ing, contracting, feeling, drowsy and then exuberant.
<div n="lb"/>The great and handsome king was actually, like the
<div n="lb"/>sea, rendered restless by wind, possessed by various
<div n="lb"/>moods.
<div n="NI"/>The father was describing a philosophy of life figuratively
<div n="lb"/>to his son, but the boy understood nothing. Then, as
[Page693-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>requested by the son, the father explained to him the
<div n="lb"/>meaning of the story as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Svottha was concretised conception born out of the
<div n="lb"/>ultimate sky. Conceptions originate and die automatic-
<div n="lb"/>ally. The whole visible world is imaginary. The world
<div n="lb"/>is there only when there is conception and in its absence
<div n="lb"/>no world exists. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and Indra are
<div n="lb"/>only parts of that conception. It is conception itself,
<div n="lb"/>which creates the world of three cities in nothingness or
<div n="lb"/>vacuum. On account of the blessing (will) of that
<div n="lb"/>fundamental Caitanya (awareness, life) the formless con-
<div n="lb"/>ception attains Brahmanhood (the universal self) and
<div n="lb"/>engages itself in the process of creation. The glittering
<div n="lb"/>city said to have been created in the sky is the fourteen
<div n="lb"/>worlds, the gardens in it are forests and woods, the play
<div n="lb"/>hills therein are mountains like the Himālayas, Meru
<div n="lb"/>etc. The two eternal lamps of heat and cold of the
<div n="lb"/>story refer to the Sun and Moon. The creepers or
<div n="lb"/>garlands of pearl refer to rivers. Special gems have
<div n="lb"/>been described as tendrils of lotus and fire in the ocean
<div n="lb"/>and the seven seas are described respectively as lotus and
<div n="lb"/>the seven tanks. The statement that in this three-tiered
<div n="lb"/>city the king of conception built play-houses referred to
<div n="lb"/>the creation of individual bodies. The houses were con-
<div n="lb"/>nected as those in the upper, middle and lower parts
<div n="lb"/>to denote living beings in the three worlds, Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka, Manuṣyaloka and Pātāla. Movement is the
<div n="lb"/>journey of bodies due to the flow of Prāṇa (breath).
<div n="lb"/>Pieces of wood refer to bones and the plastering is skin.
<div n="lb"/>Black grass said to have been used for thatching is hair
<div n="lb"/>on the head. The nine doors are the nine openings in
<div n="lb"/>the body. Windows refer to the ear, nose etc. The
<div n="lb"/>hand arms etc. are roads and the five sense organs,
<div n="lb"/>lamps. The guards, who shun and quit light, are the
<div n="lb"/>egoes which run away from knowledge and discretion.
<div n="lb"/>The king of conception or imagination born from non-
<div n="lb"/>materials finds enjoyment in the house of the body,
<div n="lb"/>but the enjoyment is only ephemeral. Imagination
<div n="lb"/>develops a moment and is extinguished, like the lamp,
<div n="lb"/>the next moment. The place or status of conceptions
<div n="lb"/>in the body may be compared to that of waves in the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. When desire takes place for things conceived it
<div n="lb"/>returns to the ‘body-house,’ which is to be born, and it
<div n="lb"/>ends or perishes on achievement. Rebirth due to desire
<div n="lb"/>(will-power) is never for happiness, but is for unending
<div n="lb"/>sorrow and pain. The wide world causes sorrow be-
<div n="lb"/>cause it is felt to be real. Absence of this feeling ends
<div n="lb"/>the sorrow as night swallows clouds. Lamentation is
<div n="lb"/>the appeal or expression of the mind remembering for-
<div n="lb"/>bidden practices in life and ānanda happiness, is the
<div n="lb"/>proud state of mind remembering noble practices.
<div n="lb"/>The three bodies of the king according to the three
<div n="lb"/>states-the best or highest, the middle one and the low-
<div n="lb"/>denote the three attributes (Sattva rajas-tamo guṇas)
<div n="lb"/>Causative of the existence of the world. The lowest
<div n="lb"/>of the attributes (tamoguṇa) or conceptions according
<div n="lb"/>to them, getting more and more pain-giving on account
<div n="lb"/>of uncultured action lead one to lower forms of life like
<div n="lb"/>the worm, tree, grass etc. Conception of real knowledge
<div n="lb"/>and truth is realisation of duty, righteousness and
<div n="lb"/>wisdom. It is next to the state of salvation called
<div n="lb"/>Deveśvara state. Rājasa (the middle attribute) guṇa
<div n="lb"/>functions as material activities in the form of attachment
<div n="lb"/>to wife, son, wealth etc. When one has rejected the
<div n="lb"/>forms of guṇas (conceptions) and the very conception
[Page694-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>is thus annihilated, one attains the supreme state.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, Oh! son! you reject all external perceptions,
<div n="lb"/>control the mind by itself and completely annihilate all
<div n="lb"/>internal and external conceptions. Whether you live in
<div n="lb"/>heaven, on earth or in pātāla and do intense tapas for
<div n="lb"/>thousands of years, unless conception is eliminated you
<div n="lb"/>will not attain salvation.
<div n="NI"/>After hearing the above explanation about the illusions
<div n="lb"/>in life, from his hiding place Vasiṣṭha went away.
<div n="lb"/>(Jñānavāsiṣṭha, Canto 17).
