UPAYĀJA¦. Brother of the hermit Yāja. Both of them
<div n="lb"/>lived on the banks of the Gaṅgā. Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī were born to the King Drupada of Pāñcāla as
<div n="lb"/>the fruit of the sacrifices performed by these hermits.
<div n="lb"/>The story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>The famous teacher Droṇa was the son of the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja, who was a friend of the King Pṛṣata of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla. So King Pṛṣata sent his son Drupada to the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Bharadvāja for education. Thus Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Drupada were fellow students.
<div n="NI"/>After completing his education Drupada became King
<div n="lb"/>of Pāñcāla. At that time the teacher Droṇa once visited
<div n="lb"/>the palace of the King. But Drupada did not duly
<div n="lb"/>receive his former classmate. Droṇa got angry at this
<div n="lb"/>and went to Hastināpura and became the teacher of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas. As a remuneration
<div n="lb"/>for teaching them Droṇa demanded that Arjuna should
<div n="lb"/>bind Drupada and bring him before him. Arjuna did
<div n="lb"/>so. Drupada gave Droṇa a portion of his kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>got his liberty. From that day onwards Drupada wished
<div n="lb"/>for a son who would take revenge on Droṇa, and
<div n="lb"/>requested the hermit Upayāja to perform a sacrifice for
<div n="lb"/>getting a son. At first the hermit refused. The King
<div n="lb"/>served the hermit for a year. The hermit was pleased
<div n="lb"/>and asked the King to invite Yāja for the sacrifice. The
<div n="lb"/>King did as he was told and Yāja and Upayāja came
<div n="lb"/>to Pāñcāla and performed the sacrifice for getting a
<div n="lb"/>son. From the sacrificial dais Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī were born. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 166
<div n="lb"/>and Sabhā Parva, Chapter 80, Stanza 45).
