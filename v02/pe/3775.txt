KULADHARMA¦. The moral and ethical codes of
<div n="lb"/>conduct, especially with reference to family life. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>told the following about Kuladharmas to Kṛṣṇa at
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra.
<div n="NI"/>In the decline of a family, its time-honoured usages
<div n="lb"/>perish; with the perishing of such rites impiety over-
<div n="lb"/>takes the entire family.
<div n="NI"/>With the growth of impiety even the noble women
<div n="lb"/>become unchaste, and if women become corrupt,
<div n="lb"/>mixture of castes ensues.
<div n="NI"/>Hell is verily the lot of the family and family-destroyers
<div n="lb"/>through caste admixture; for, their ancestors fall
<div n="lb"/>deprived of balls of rice and libations.
<div n="NI"/>The ever-lasting caste virtues and the family merits get
<div n="lb"/>ruined because of the chaos in the caste system.
<div n="lb"/>We have heard that hell is verily the long-lasting abode
<div n="lb"/>of the men whose family religious practices have been
<div n="lb"/>broken. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 25 and the Gītā).
