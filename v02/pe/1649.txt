DADHĪCA¦. (DADHĪCI).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} A famous hermit. Mention is made in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 83, that
<div n="lb"/>this hermit was the son of the great hermit Bhṛgu, and
[Page191-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>that he was made of the essences of the world, with a
<div n="lb"/>huge body.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The birth of the hermit Sārasvata.%} Dadhīca erected his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage on the bank of the river Sarasvatī and began
<div n="lb"/>to do penance. The power of penance increased daily.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing this Indra was flurried. So he sent the celestial
<div n="lb"/>maid Alaṃbuṣā to break the penance of Dadhīca some-
<div n="lb"/>how or other. Alaṃbuṣā came to the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīca and began to dance and sing. When the hermit
<div n="lb"/>saw her he grew lustful and seminal discharge occurred
<div n="lb"/>to him. The semen fell in the river Sarasvatī, who be-
<div n="lb"/>came pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child.
<div n="lb"/>She took the child to the hermit Dadhīca and told him
<div n="lb"/>the story of the child. The hermit was much pleased.
<div n="lb"/>He took the child and embraced it and blessed the river
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“Brahmā, the gods and the celestial maids will be pleased
<div n="lb"/>if your water is offered as oblation.”
<div n="NI"/>Dadhīci then said that the child should be named Sāras-
<div n="lb"/>vata. He also added that when there was a drought conti-
<div n="lb"/>nuously for twelve years, Sārasvata would have the
<div n="lb"/>power to bring rain. Then Sarasvatī took the child to
<div n="lb"/>her abode and brought it up.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How he destroyed the asuras with the head of a horse.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīci went to the world of the devas (gods).
<div n="lb"/>From there he looked down and saw the earth filled with
<div n="lb"/>the asuras. Indra went to destroy them. But he could
<div n="lb"/>not. So he made a search for anything left behind by
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīca. He understood that Dadhīca had with him
<div n="lb"/>the head of a horse. It was found in a lake in the country
<div n="lb"/>of Śaraṇya. With the bones taken from that head Indra
<div n="lb"/>and Dadhīca destroyed a large number of asuras.
<div n="lb"/>(Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 13, Sūkta 84).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The weapon%} (Vajra) of Indra was made from a bone.
<div n="lb"/>A story occurs in the Mahābhārata, which says that the
<div n="lb"/>Diamond-weapon of Indra was made of a bone of
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīci. The asuras went to fight with Indra under the
<div n="lb"/>leadership of Vṛttrāsura. Indra tried his utmost to kill
<div n="lb"/>Vṛttrāsura, but he could not. At last Indra approached
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, who told Indra that if a bone of the hermit,
<div n="lb"/>called Dadhīca was obtained it could effectively be used
<div n="lb"/>against Vṛtra. Accordingly Indra went with Nara
<div n="lb"/>and Nārāyaṇa to the banks of the river Sarasvatī and
<div n="lb"/>entered the hermitage and bowed before the shining
<div n="lb"/>hermit Dadhīca and informed him of their errand. The
<div n="lb"/>hermit replied that he had no objection in giving his
<div n="lb"/>bone to save the gods. Saying thus the hermit discarded
<div n="lb"/>his life. Indra took the bone of Dadhīci and made his
<div n="lb"/>weapon of Diamond (Vajra) with which he killed Vṛtra
<div n="lb"/>and his followers. (Mahābhārata, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) At the sacrifice of Dakṣa, Dadhīci got angry because
<div n="lb"/>Śiva was not given his dues of the sacrifice. (M.B. Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 284).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once Dadhīci talked to a Brāhmin called Karuṇa
<div n="lb"/>about the importance of the ashes dedicated to Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 101).
<div n="NI"/>(3) See Dhanañjaya V to know how this hermit gave
<div n="lb"/>absolution from curse to a fly.
