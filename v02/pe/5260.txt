PRADYUMNA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A son born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa of his
<div n="lb"/>wife Rukmiṇī, Pradyumna was the rebirth of Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>deva. (For genealogy see under Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} It was at the time when Kāmadeva and
<div n="lb"/>Ratidevī were living together that Pārvatī, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Himavān, started her penance to get Śiva as her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band. It was a need of the devas to get a son of Śiva to
<div n="lb"/>kill the fierce demon Tārakāsura. The devas employed
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva to create feelings of love in the ascetic Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and make him marry Pārvatī. Taking instructions from
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Kāmadeva took aim at Śiva with his bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrow. Śiva was then in deep meditation and Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>deva broke his concentration and Śiva got angry. He
<div n="lb"/>opened his third eye and burnt Kāmadeva to death.
<div n="NI"/>Griefstricken by the death of her husband Ratidevī per-
<div n="lb"/>formed penance near the Himālayas to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Mahādevī. Mahādevī appeared before her and consoled
<div n="lb"/>her thus: “Little girl, Kāmadeva would be reborn as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa of Rukmiṇī. He would then be
<div n="lb"/>named Pradyumna. The devas have cursed Śambara
<div n="lb"/>the leader of the asuras, during the battle between the
<div n="lb"/>demons and the demi-gods that he (Śambara) would be
<div n="lb"/>killed by Pradyumna. So Śambara is now searching
<div n="lb"/>for the infant which is a rebirth of Kāmadeva. So you
<div n="lb"/>abandon your present body and be born again as Māyā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī to be the wife of Śambara. Pradyumna, the re-
<div n="lb"/>born Kāmadeva, would kill Śambara and accept you as
<div n="lb"/>his wife.” Devī disappeared after saying this.
<div n="NI"/>Obeying the instructions of Mahādevī, Rati abandoned
<div n="lb"/>her life and was born in the world of asuras. She grew
<div n="lb"/>up under the name Māyāvatī and became the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Śambara.
<div n="NI"/>While Śrī Kṛṣṇa was living as the chief of Dvārakā his
<div n="lb"/>first wife Rukmiṇī was yearning for a child. Kṛṣṇa was
<div n="lb"/>deeply moved by the grief of Rukmiṇī and he flew on
<div n="lb"/>the back of Garuḍa to Kailāsa to obtain a boon for the
<div n="lb"/>birth of a child for her. On the way he alighted in the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Naranārāyaṇas and after obtaining the bless-
<div n="lb"/>ings of the sages there, went to Kailāsa and bowed
<div n="lb"/>before Śiva and explained to him the purpose of his
<div n="lb"/>visit. Śiva blessed him and said that Kāmadeva who
<div n="lb"/>was burnt to death by the fire of his third eye would
<div n="lb"/>take birth again as the son of Rukmiṇī. Kṛṣṇa returned
<div n="lb"/>to Dvārakā well-pleased. Rukmiṇī became pregnant
<div n="lb"/>and gave birth to Pradyumna, a rebirth of Kāmadeva.
<div n="lb"/>The demon Śambara knew of this birth and coming to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā in an invisible form carried away the infant
<div n="lb"/>when it was seven days old.
<div n="NI"/>The demon threw the child into the ocean and a great
<div n="lb"/>fish swallowed it. The fishermen of the country of
<div n="lb"/>Śambara caught this fish and following the custom pre-
<div n="lb"/>valent there presented the king with the fish. Śambara
<div n="lb"/>called his wife Māyāvatī and asked her to take the fish
[Page594-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and get it cooked. When Māyāvatī cut open the fish for
<div n="lb"/>cooking she found to her surprise a beautiful child in-
<div n="lb"/>side it. Even from the first sight of the child Māyāvatī
<div n="lb"/>had a great liking for it and so she took the child and
<div n="lb"/>brought it up as her own child.
<div n="NI"/>When Pradyumna grew into a youth all the charm
<div n="lb"/>and beauty of Kāmadeva were found in him. Māyāvatī
<div n="lb"/>was excited to find a resemblance in him of her lost
<div n="lb"/>husband Kāmadeva. One day the great sage Nārada
<div n="lb"/>came that way and calling Māyāvatī to his side secretly
<div n="lb"/>revealed to her that Pradyumna was the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva and was thus her lost husband. From that
<div n="lb"/>day onwards Māyāvatī's affection for him changed into
<div n="lb"/>one of love. She taught him all the magic and witch-
<div n="lb"/>craft of Śambara. When Pradyumna found that Māyā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī's affection for him was gradually changing into one
<div n="lb"/>of passionate love he questioned her about it. Māyāvatī
<div n="lb"/>then told him everything that happened and Pra-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna decided to kill Śambara and take Māyāvatī
<div n="lb"/>away.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%War with Śambara.%} Pradyumna waited for an
<div n="lb"/>opportunity to kill Śambara. One day Pradyumna went
<div n="lb"/>under the flagstaff of Śambara which flew the royal flag
<div n="lb"/>of the king with an emblem of the figure of a lion em-
<div n="lb"/>bossed on it. He dropped it down by one stroke of his
<div n="lb"/>arrow. Hearing of this Śambara ordered his sons to kill
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna. The eleven sons of Śambara, viz., Atisena,
<div n="lb"/>Citrasena, Viṣvaksena, Śrutasena, Suṣeṇa, Somasena,
<div n="lb"/>Ākkāla, Vikala, Kumbhaketu, Sudaṃṣṭra and Keśī,
<div n="lb"/>attacked Pradyumna. The devas came in their vimānas
<div n="lb"/>and joined sides with Pradyumna. The army of the
<div n="lb"/>demons teased him with various kinds of weapons like
<div n="lb"/>javelins, arrows, spears and battle axes. But Pra-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna cut them all by his arrows and cut to pieces all
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Śambara. Then Śambara sent an army
<div n="lb"/>against him. They were also made to flee by the arrows
<div n="lb"/>of Pradyumna. Then Śambara himself came on the
<div n="lb"/>scene. The fight became horrible. The continuous flow
<div n="lb"/>of arrows made it impossible for even Sun's rays to
<div n="lb"/>reach the earth. Then Śambara started his magical war.
<div n="lb"/>But Pradyumna faced that also. Śambara sent phantom
<div n="lb"/>lions; but Pradyumna made them immobile. Śambara
<div n="lb"/>then in turn created storms, rains, wild animals, ser-
<div n="lb"/>pents and vultures. All of them were killed by Pradyu-
<div n="lb"/>mna. Then with a well-aimed arrow Pradyumna killed
<div n="lb"/>Śambara. Then he rushed to Dvārakā carrying Māyā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī with him. The people of Dvārakā were astounded
<div n="lb"/>to see them. Pradyumna went to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Ruk-
<div n="lb"/>miṇī and told them the whole story. They were over-
<div n="lb"/>joyed to find them and blessed them.
<div n="NI"/>Aniruddha who married Uṣā the daughter of Bāṇa was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Pradyumna. (Chapters 103 to 108, 10th
