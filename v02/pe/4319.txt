MAṆIBHADRA I¦. A Yakṣa. He who worships this
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣa would get his desire fulfilled. This Yakṣa is
<div n="lb"/>installed in a temple near the city of Tāmralipti. If any-
<div n="lb"/>body commits adultery in that place Maṇibhadra would
<div n="lb"/>take him to the temple and keep him there for the night.
<div n="lb"/>Next morning he would take the couple before the
<div n="lb"/>King and exposing the sin would get them killed by
<div n="lb"/>the King.
<div n="NI"/>Once a Vaiśya named Samudradatta committed adult-
<div n="lb"/>ery and another house-holder found it out and took
<div n="lb"/>them to the temple of Maṇibhadra and kept them there
<div n="lb"/>Śaktimatī, the virtuous wife of Samudradatta came to
<div n="lb"/>know of the mishap to her husband and the intelligent
<div n="lb"/>woman went to the temple with materials for worship
<div n="lb"/>and under the pretext of worshipping made the priest
<div n="lb"/>of the temple open the doors. When she entered
<div n="lb"/>Samudradatta felt ashamed and sat with his head bent
<div n="lb"/>down. Śaktimatī gave the other woman her own dress
<div n="lb"/>taking hers in return and sent her out as Śaktimatī with-
<div n="lb"/>out raising the least suspicion in the priest. Then she
<div n="lb"/>remained with Samudradatta, and when in the morn-
<div n="lb"/>ing officers of the King came to take them they were
<div n="lb"/>surprised to find that the culprits were really husband
<div n="lb"/>and wife. The house-holder was punished for giving
[Page478-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>wrong information and Samudradatta was set free with
<div n="lb"/>his wife. (Kathāmukhalambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
