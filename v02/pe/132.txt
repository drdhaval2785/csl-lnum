AJARA¦. Tapantaka, the minister of King Vatsa, told
<div n="lb"/>him the story of a man named Ajara to illustrate the law
<div n="lb"/>that all people will have to suffer the consequences of
<div n="lb"/>their actions in a previous birth. The story is given be-
<div n="lb"/>low:—
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time, there lived a King named Vinayaśīla
<div n="lb"/>in Vilāsapura, in the city of Śrīkaṇṭhanagarī. After
<div n="lb"/>some years, the King was affected by wrinkles of old age.
<div n="lb"/>A physician named Taruṇacandra came to the palace to
<div n="lb"/>cure the King of his wrinkles. “The King should remain
<div n="lb"/>alone in the interior of the earth for full eight months.
<div n="lb"/>He has to use a medicine while remaining there. It
<div n="lb"/>should not even be seen by anyone else. I myself am to
<div n="lb"/>administer the medicine”—This was the physician's
<div n="lb"/>prescription. The King agreed. Accordingly the King

<div n="lb"/>and the physician spent six months in the interior of the
<div n="lb"/>earth. After that the physician, after a search, found a
<div n="lb"/>man who exactly resembled the King and brought him
<div n="lb"/>to the interior of the earth. After two more months,
<div n="lb"/>the physician murdered the King and came out with the
<div n="lb"/>new man. The people welcomed him with honour as
<div n="lb"/>the King who was cured of his wrinkles. This man was
<div n="lb"/>Ajara. After some time, the physician approached
<div n="lb"/>Ajara for his reward. Ajara said: “It is by my Karma-
<div n="lb"/>phala (consequence of my actions in my previous birth)
<div n="lb"/>that I have become King. In my previous birth I re-
<div n="lb"/>nounced my body after doing penance. According to the
<div n="lb"/>boon which God gave me on that occasion, I have be-
<div n="lb"/>come King in my present birth”. The physician returned
<div n="lb"/>empty-handed. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratnaprabhā-
<div n="lb"/>laṃbaka, 6th Taraṅga).
