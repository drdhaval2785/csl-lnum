YAJÑADATTA II¦. A Brāhmaṇa. There was a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>village called Mahat at the foot of the Yāmuna mount-
<div n="lb"/>ain, between the rivers Gaṅgā and Yamunā. This
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa was born and brought up here. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story in Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 92, about him, which
<div n="lb"/>says that by mistake he was taken to hell by Kāla's
<div n="lb"/>messenger and that he was reluctant to leave hell. The
<div n="lb"/>story is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Yama (Kāla) ordered his agent to bring the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa named Yajñadatta, who lived in Mahat village,
<div n="lb"/>born in Vasiṣṭha gotra and was gentle, scholarly and
<div n="lb"/>well-versed in Yajña practices. He was specially warned
<div n="lb"/>that he should not make a mistake as there was another
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa with the same name who lived in the neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bourhood and who resembled Yajñadatta in appearance,
<div n="lb"/>learning and in every other respect. But in spite of Yama's
<div n="lb"/>specific warning, his agent brought the wrong person.
<div n="NI"/>Yama, with his sense of justice, received him with due
<div n="lb"/>respect and allowed him to return to the world. But
<div n="lb"/>Yajñadatta was not willing to return to the world.
