<div n="NI"/>Pulastya had a son named Dattoli (Dambholi) of his

<div n="NI"/>Pulastya had a son named Viśravas of his wife Havir-
<div n="lb"/>bhū. (4th Skandha, Bhāgavata). Mahābhārata states that
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya had two wives named Sandhyā and Pratīcī.
<div n="lb"/>Havirbhū mother of Viśravas had another name,
<div n="lb"/>Māninī.
<div n="NI"/>All these statements taken together indicate that Pulas-
<div n="lb"/>tya had four wives named Prīti, Havirbhū, Sandhyā

<div n="lb"/>three sons, Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa, and Vibhīṣaṇa and

<div n="lb"/>Pulastya Maharṣi was doing penance on Mt. Meru. On
<div n="lb"/>a nearby hillock the sage Tṛṇabindu was also doing
<div n="lb"/>penance. Celestial maidens, Nāga maidens and their
<div n="lb"/>lovers came to the āśrama and by their erotic sports
<div n="lb"/>and dances vitiated the precincts of the āśrama. Pulastya
<div n="lb"/>got angry and cursed all the maidens to become preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant if they entered the āśrama area. Without know-
<div n="lb"/>ing this curse Māninī, daughter of Tṛṇabindu came to
<div n="lb"/>that spot and got pregnant of Pulastya. Pulastya then
<div n="lb"/>married her and the celebrated Maharṣi Viśravas was

<div n="lb"/>a victory campaign met Kārtavīryārjuna on the shores
<div n="lb"/>of Narmadā. Kārtavīryārjuna chained Rāvaṇa in the
<div n="lb"/>former's prison. Pulastya was grieved much to hear
<div n="lb"/>about the plight of his grandson and going to Kārta-
