ŚIBI V¦. An ancient Rājarṣi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-Nahuṣa-
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti-Anudruhyu-Sabhānara-Kālanara-Sṛñjaya-
<div n="lb"/>Uśīnara-Śibi.
<div n="NI"/>Śibi was born to Uśīnara of Mādhavī, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Suhotra made to give way.%} King Suhotra of Kuru
<div n="lb"/>dynasty once on his return from a visit of maharṣis saw
<div n="lb"/>King Śibi coming in the opposite direction in his
<div n="lb"/>chariot, and both the Kings saluted each other as their
<div n="lb"/>age ordained. But, they did not give passage to each
<div n="lb"/>other as they thought themselves to be equal in merit.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Nārada came there and asked the kings
<div n="lb"/>why they stood there thus blocking the path. They
<div n="lb"/>answered Nārada thus: “He who is more noble or
<div n="lb"/>clever on account of former actions etc. is usually
<div n="lb"/>given way to by the other person. Both of us are
<div n="lb"/>comrades and are equals.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada then spoke as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Oh! King of the Kuru dynasty! You are cruel to the
<div n="lb"/>gentle and gentle to the cruel. To the evil you are
<div n="lb"/>good; then why not be good to the good. Devas have
<div n="lb"/>ordered that he who does good will get it hundred-
<div n="lb"/>fold by return. King Uśīnara is more noble and gentle
<div n="lb"/>than you are. The miser is won over by liberality,
<div n="lb"/>the liar by truth, the cruel by patience and the evil
<div n="lb"/>person by good. But, both of you Kings are noble
<div n="lb"/>persons. Therefore, one of you should give way to the
<div n="lb"/>other.”
<div n="NI"/>Listening to Nārada's advice, Suhotra gave way to
<div n="lb"/>Śibi and proceeded on his way. (Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>194).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śibi tested.%} Śibi's fame spread in the three worlds,
<div n="lb"/>and an idea was mooted among the Devas that it should
<div n="lb"/>be tested how much of the reputation of the King was
<div n="lb"/>genuine. Accordingly, Agni in the form of a dove
<div n="lb"/>and Indra in that of a kite hunting after the dove,
<div n="lb"/>rushed to King Śibi. The dove took refuge in the lap
<div n="lb"/>of the King sitting in ‘divya’ posture, and the priest
<div n="lb"/>told the King that it was the latter's duty to protect
<div n="lb"/>the dove, which took refuge with him for its life. The
<div n="lb"/>dove also told the King thus; “I am really a muni,
<div n="lb"/>who has entered the body of the dove. I take refuge
<div n="lb"/>in you for my life.”
<div n="NI"/>By that time the kite too had flown up to the King. It
<div n="lb"/>asked the King to return the dove, which it had been
<div n="lb"/>chasing. The King was surprised to hear the kite talk
<div n="lb"/>and told the bird that it was not proper for him to give
<div n="lb"/>up the dove who had sought refuge under him, but
<div n="lb"/>that he would give the kite any other flesh in lieu of the
[Page716-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>dove. The kite replied as follows: “You must give me
<div n="lb"/>flesh cut from your right thigh equal in weight to that
<div n="lb"/>of the dove. If you do so, the dove will be saved and
<div n="lb"/>you will be praised by people.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly, the King cut a piece of flesh from his
<div n="lb"/>right thigh and weighed it in the balance against the
<div n="lb"/>dove. But, the dove weighed more. The King cut more
<div n="lb"/>flesh from his thigh and weighed, but the dove still
<div n="lb"/>weighed more. Thus, by instalments the King cut his
<div n="lb"/>whole body and weighed the flesh against the dove,
<div n="lb"/>yet it weighed more. Then the King himself sat in the
<div n="lb"/>balance, seeing which the kite flew away. Then the
<div n="lb"/>dove assumed its original form and told the King that
<div n="lb"/>it was Agni and the kite, Indra. The Devas were
<div n="lb"/>greatly pleased with the firm sense of sacrifice of the
<div n="lb"/>King; they blessed him and told him that a son called
<div n="lb"/>Kapotaromā will be born to him. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 197).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) When Yayāti fell down on earth from heaven, Śibi

<div n="lb"/>him (Śibi). (Ādi Parva, Chapter 93, Verse 3).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Śibi worships Yama in his court. (Sabhā Parva,

<div n="lb"/>cow by the Kauravas. (Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 56, Verse
<div n="lb"/>9).

<div n="NI"/>(vii) He did not eat flesh. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Conclusion.%} The story of two Kings connected with
<div n="lb"/>the episode of the dove and the kite is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata. One of the Kings is Śibi and the
<div n="lb"/>other Uśīnara, father of Śibi. (See under Uśīnara).
