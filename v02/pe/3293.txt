KAPIÑJARA¦. (KAPIÑJALA). A bird. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story about the origin of this bird in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>Once Tvaṣṭā created Triśiras to kill Indra. Triśiras had
<div n="lb"/>three heads. When by one head he recited the Vedas by
<div n="lb"/>another head he drank wine and by the third he looked
<div n="lb"/>at the world wickedly. Indra envious of the growing
<div n="lb"/>strength of Triśiras felled him down by his Vajrāyudha.
<div n="lb"/>A person called Takṣaka carrying an axe came that
<div n="lb"/>way then and by orders from Indra he cut off the heads
<div n="lb"/>of Triśiras. When the heads fell down there emerged
<div n="lb"/>from them birds called Kapiñjala, Tittiri and Kala-
<div n="lb"/>piṅgala. From the head which recited the Vedas came
<div n="lb"/>the birds Kapiñjalas; from the head that drank the
<div n="lb"/>wine came the birds Kalapiṅgalas; and from the head
<div n="lb"/>that looked at the world with wickedness came the
<div n="lb"/>birds Tittiris. (Chapter 9, Udyoga Parva).
