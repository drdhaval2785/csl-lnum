PUṢPAVATĪ¦. A sacred place. If one stays here for
<div n="lb"/>three nights fasting and bathes in the holy pond there
<div n="lb"/>one would get the benefit of making a thousand
<div n="lb"/>godānas (cow-gifts) and his family will be absolved of
<div n="lb"/>all sins. (Śloka 12, Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
