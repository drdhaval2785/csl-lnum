VEDA¦ (S).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Introduction.%} The root ‘Vid’ in Sanskrit means ‘to
<div n="lb"/>know’. The books composed of the knowledge of the
[Page842-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Āryans, collected and compiled were called the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The origin and importance of the Vedas.%} It is said that
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was the creator of the Vedas. Many say that,
<div n="lb"/>for the performance of sacrifices Brahmā created from
<div n="lb"/>Agni (fire), Vāyu (Wind) and Ravi (the Sun), the
<div n="lb"/>three Vedas Ṛg, Yajus and Sāman which are eternal and
<div n="lb"/>in accordance with regulations.
<div n="NI"/>The Vedas have two sides, the spiritual and the mun-
<div n="lb"/>dane. Moreover all the explanations of the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>from the Brāhmaṇas to the Bhāṣya of Sāyaṇa, pertain
<div n="lb"/>to sacrifices. The literary meaning of Veda is mundane.
<div n="lb"/>Considering these two points and the facts that they are
<div n="lb"/>religious books and that they reveal the mental and
<div n="lb"/>social outlooks of the early Āryans, and as the origin of
<div n="lb"/>all the thoughts of Indians, all the Vedas, especially
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda, hold a lofty place.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Parts of the Vedas.%} Mahāviṣṇu incarnated as Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>in Dvāpara Yuga and divided the Vedas. The first
<div n="lb"/>Veda consisted of four pādas and a hundred thousand
<div n="lb"/>granthas. Vyāsa divided it into four parts known as,
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda.
<div n="lb"/>The sage and seer Vyāsa thus created by Ṛg, “Hautra”
<div n="lb"/>(a collection of lyrics in praise of different Gods, to be
<div n="lb"/>recited by the priest styled the ‘hotṛ’), by Yajus
<div n="lb"/>“Ādhvaryava”, (a book of sacrificial prayer, of prose
<div n="lb"/>formulas to be uttered by the ‘Adhvaryu’ priest, who
<div n="lb"/>performed the manual work involved in a sacrifice), by
<div n="lb"/>Sāman, “Audgātra”, (Songs meant to be sung at the
<div n="lb"/>Soma sacrifice by a special class of priests ‘Udgātṛ’) and
<div n="lb"/>by Atharva “Brahmatva”, (a collection of songs, spells
<div n="lb"/>and incantations, for the healing of disease, the restora-
<div n="lb"/>tion of harmony, the exorcism of evil spirits and to
<div n="lb"/>celebrate the power and omniscience of God) and
<div n="lb"/>established them separately. Paila, a scholar in Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda, and a disciple of Vyāsa, gave the original Veda
<div n="lb"/>to Indrapramiti and its Saṃhitā (collections) to Bāṣkala
<div n="lb"/>as gifts. Bāṣkala divided the Saṃhitā into four, and
<div n="lb"/>gave each of them to Baudhya and others. Yajurveda
<div n="lb"/>was divided into twentyfour branches. They were com-
<div n="lb"/>posed by Vaiśampāyana of extraordinary intelligence,
<div n="lb"/>a disciple of Vyāsa. Kāṇḍas (Chapters) such as Vāja-
<div n="lb"/>saneya etc. were composed later by hermits such as
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya and others in the form of Smṛtis (tradition,
<div n="lb"/>as handing down only the tradition derived from an-
<div n="lb"/>cient sages, to whom the Vedas were ‘revealed’).
<div n="lb"/>Jaimini the disciple of Vyāsa, divided Sāmaveda into
<div n="lb"/>different branches. Sumantu and Sukarmā compiled
<div n="lb"/>separate Saṃhitās (collections) from them. Sukarmā
<div n="lb"/>composed thousand Saṃhitās. Sumantu the disciple
<div n="lb"/>of Vyāsa took the Atharvaveda and taught it to
<div n="lb"/>thousands of Paippalāda disciples. By the blessings of
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa, Sūta made the Purāṇa Saṃhitā (the collection
<div n="lb"/>of Purāṇas). (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 150).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Branches af the Vedas.%} It has already been mentioned
<div n="lb"/>that the Vedas are four in number called Ṛg, Yajus,
<div n="lb"/>Sāma and Atharva. Each of these Vedas has branches
<div n="lb"/>called Saṃhitās (collections) and Brāhmaṇas (treatises
<div n="lb"/>relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony). Āraṇyakas
<div n="lb"/>are appendices to the Brāhmaṇas. Upaniṣads (secret
<div n="lb"/>or esoteric doctrines) are appendices of the Āraṇyakas.
<div n="lb"/>Thus each of the Vedas has Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas,
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads. All these are, in a way, ex-
<div n="lb"/>positions of the Vedas. In all these expositions there
<div n="lb"/>are numberless Sūktas. All these taken together are
<div n="lb"/>called Vedic literature.
[Page842-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>In the Saṃhitās there are lyrics in praise of different gods.
<div n="lb"/>All these are spells and incantations (mantras) in the
<div n="lb"/>form of songs. The under-currents of all these spells are
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and stories from the Vedas. Generally speaking
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇas contain prose texts giving practical
<div n="lb"/>observations on sacrifice which are mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>songs of praise. Here and there stories from Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>and epics occur. The Āraṇyakas (forest-texts) got that
<div n="lb"/>name, because they are books of instruction to be given
<div n="lb"/>in the forest or writings meant for wood-dwelling her-
<div n="lb"/>mits. As they contained esoteric spells and incanta-
<div n="lb"/>tions which might cause injury even to those who were
<div n="lb"/>not concerned with them instruction in them was not
<div n="lb"/>given in towns or villages. The contents of the Āraṇy-
<div n="lb"/>akas are the allegorical signification of the rites and
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices and the mystic meaning of the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>It has been mentioned that the Upaniṣads are append-
<div n="lb"/>ices of the Āraṇyakas. Still there is not much differ-
<div n="lb"/>ence between the two and hence they cannot be separat-
<div n="lb"/>ed from one another so easily. The Upaniṣads are
<div n="lb"/>called Vedāntas, (The aim and completion of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas), because they are the end of the Vedas. The
<div n="lb"/>Vedāntas belong to the later period of the Vedic age.
<div n="lb"/>Instruction in Vedāntas was given only after completing
<div n="lb"/>the study of the mantras (Vedas) and the Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="lb"/>The Upaniṣads contain philosophical speculations about
<div n="lb"/>the conception of Brahman and the Vedas. The word
<div n="lb"/>Veda includes the Vedāṅgas also. Vedāṅgas (Ancillaries
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedas) are Śikṣā (phonetics), Vyākaraṇa
<div n="lb"/>(grammar), Chandas (metrics), Nirukta (etymology),
<div n="lb"/>Joytiṣa (astronomy), and Kalpa (ritual). At first
<div n="lb"/>instruction is given in the study of Brahman and the
<div n="lb"/>study of Vedas. When more discussions and expositions
<div n="lb"/>on them are needed, the study of Brāhmaṇas and
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyakas are resorted to. In course of time the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas, which contain discussions
<div n="lb"/>and expositions of the Vedas became independent
<div n="lb"/>branches of study under these names. That is why they
<div n="lb"/>contain mainly prose texts.
<div n="NI"/>There are one lakh of mantras or spells and incanta-
<div n="lb"/>tions in all the four Vedas taken together. They are
<div n="lb"/>for blessing everybody and to make the four objects of
<div n="lb"/>life easily attainable. Sāṅkhyāyana and Āśvalāyana
<div n="lb"/>sorted and grouped the mantras. Accordingly there
<div n="lb"/>are two thousand one hundred and ten mantras known
<div n="lb"/>as Brāhmaṇas. Dvaipāyana and other hermits have
<div n="lb"/>stated the number of granthas (verses) in Ṛgveda. It
<div n="lb"/>is said that there are one thousand nine hundred and
<div n="lb"/>ninety nine mantras in Yajurveda. There are one
<div n="lb"/>thousand eighty-six branches also. The branches in
<div n="lb"/>Yajus are known by the names Kāṇvī, Mādhyandinī,
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭhī, Madhyakaṭhī, Maitrāyaṇī, Taittirīya, Vaiśam-
<div n="lb"/>pāyanikā and so on.
<div n="NI"/>In Sāma Veda there are branches such as Kauthumī,
<div n="lb"/>Ātharvaṇāyinī and so on; and songs such as Āraṇyakam,
<div n="lb"/>Uktham, Ūham and son on. The number of Sāmavedic
<div n="lb"/>verses are nine thousand four hundred and twenty-
<div n="lb"/>five.
<div n="NI"/>Sumantu, Jañjali, Ślokāyani, Śaunaka, Pippalāda,
<div n="lb"/>Muñjakeśa and such others were responsible for the
<div n="lb"/>sorting and grouping of the mantras in the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda. Altogether there are one thousand six hundred
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 271).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Expositions of the Vedas.%} The religion of the Āryans
<div n="lb"/>became an established one when Vyāsa had created the
[Page843-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Vedasaṃhitās. The aim of Vyāsa was to bring about
<div n="lb"/>uniformity in the religious observances by performing
<div n="lb"/>rites and rituals, religious ceremonies such as sacrifices
<div n="lb"/>etc. without any flaw. Following this a very wide
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature grew up. The study of the Vedas,
<div n="lb"/>critical review of meaning, the connection between
<div n="lb"/>mantras and tantras (Chants and rituals), Grammar,
<div n="lb"/>etymology, all these became inevitable. As the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>could be looked at from different points of view, from
<div n="lb"/>very early days, various types of expositions of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas came out. Seven types of commentaries,
<div n="lb"/>Nairukta, Yājñika, Vaiyākaraṇa Jyautiṣa, Sāmpradāyika
<div n="lb"/>Ādhyātmika, Aitihāsika (pertaining to etymology,
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, grammar astronomy, customs of a tribe,
<div n="lb"/>Brāhma or Spiritual legends and ancient lore) were
<div n="lb"/>the prominent among them. When the westerners
<div n="lb"/>began research work in the Vedas, another branch of
<div n="lb"/>literature also took form, known as the Āgamikas
<div n="lb"/>(the historical). Even in the time of Yāska, who
<div n="lb"/>was an authority on Nirukta (etymology) the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>were expounded on the basis of legends and ancient
<div n="lb"/>lore. Hints to this effect are seen in Yāska's works.
<div n="lb"/>Mention is made about other types of expositions also,
<div n="lb"/>in them. The last book of importance in the Sāmpra-
<div n="lb"/>dāyika type of exposition, was Vedārthaprakāśa, of
<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa. But the commentary of Skandasvāmī, the
<div n="lb"/>books Ṛgarthadipikā and Udgīthabhāṣya of Mādhavā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya etc. have spread the sāmpradāyika type of
<div n="lb"/>speculations in India. There is another cult in India
<div n="lb"/>which believes that everything seen in the Vedas is
<div n="lb"/>spiritual and that the spells and incantations are
<div n="lb"/>esoteric.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The gods of the Vedas.%} All the gods known today
<div n="lb"/>are not found in the Vedas. Even those who are found
<div n="lb"/>do not have the prominence that is given to them now.
<div n="lb"/>For example, the deity Viṣṇu, worshipped as one of
<div n="lb"/>the three godheads today, is not as omnipotent as the
<div n="lb"/>Indra of the Vedas. Though Viṣṇu is praised in five
<div n="lb"/>spells in Ṛgveda, when compared with other deities,
<div n="lb"/>he was not of much prominence. In the Vedas the
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Vāmana is not given much importance.
<div n="lb"/>Even though Rudra is a recognized deity and mention
<div n="lb"/>occurs about Kapardī, in the Vedas, there is not a song
<div n="lb"/>of praise of Śiva in the Ṛgveda. There is no mention
<div n="lb"/>at all, about the worship of the Phallus, Devī and so
<div n="lb"/>on in the Vedas. The Vedas celebrate the Omniscience
<div n="lb"/>of Varuṇa, Indra, Agni, Mitra, the Maruts and so on.
<div n="lb"/>The lustre of Indra was gradually dimmed with the
<div n="lb"/>efflux of time and he became a mere libertine in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. The importance of many deities such as
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, Agni, Mitra, Aśvin and so on was greatly dimi-
<div n="lb"/>nished in the Purāṇas. Thirtythree deities pertaining
<div n="lb"/>to Earth, Ether and Sky are praised in the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The rites concerning instruction in Vedas.%} Manu has
<div n="lb"/>given certain instructions as to how the teaching of
<div n="lb"/>Vedas should be conducted.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The teachers of Veda.%} See under Guruparamparā.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The period of the Vedas.%} The Indians believe that the
<div n="lb"/>spells and incantations and the Brāhmaṇas are not man-
<div n="lb"/>made, but are revelations by God. So they are con-
<div n="lb"/>sidered to be beginningless and endless. The hermits
<div n="lb"/>are considered to be seers of the spells. It is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>“Mantradraṣṭāraḥ na tu Kartāraḥ”. (They are seers
<div n="lb"/>of Mantra, not makers). In the opinion of one party,
<div n="lb"/>according to this maxim, it is not necessary to search
[Page843-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>for the creators or the period of creation, of mantras.
<div n="lb"/>They hold that only the Sūtras (thread, clue, guide,
<div n="lb"/>rule, aphorism) are made by man.
<div n="NI"/>The westerners and the modern thinkers of India do
<div n="lb"/>not agree completely with this view. They believe
<div n="lb"/>that the early Āryans who entered India, first settled
<div n="lb"/>down in the Punjab and that the local civilization which
<div n="lb"/>they had assumed, broke out as songs of praise. In
<div n="lb"/>course of time, these songs of Praise took the form of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda mantras (saying, song, formula). In the begin-
<div n="lb"/>ning there was only one Veda. Many believe that this
<div n="lb"/>state continued up to B.C. 1500. It is a fact universally
<div n="lb"/>acknowledged, that this Vedic literature is the most
<div n="lb"/>ancient literature of the world. There is difference of
<div n="lb"/>opinion as to the period of origin of this Vedic literature.
<div n="lb"/>Prof. Macdonell and Prof. Jacobi are foremost among
<div n="lb"/>those who have made their opinions. In the opinion
<div n="lb"/>of Prof. Macdonell, the Vedic literature originated in
<div n="lb"/>the period between B.C. 1500 and 1200. But Jacobi's
<div n="lb"/>opinion is that all the Vedas were made before B.C.
<div n="lb"/>4000.
