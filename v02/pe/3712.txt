KṚTYĀ¦ (KṚTYAKĀ) I. A Rākṣasī who is born when
<div n="lb"/>the black arts as enunciated in the Atharvaveda are
<div n="lb"/>practised to annihilate enemies. Kṛtyā may appear in
<div n="lb"/>male form too. Some of the activities of Kṛtyā are
<div n="lb"/>given below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Carried off Duryodhana.%} While the Pāṇḍavas were
<div n="lb"/>living in exile in the forest, Duryodhana and others
<div n="lb"/>went in a procession to the forest. Though Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>was taken into captivity in the forest by a Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva, Arjuna saved him out of fraternal considera-
<div n="lb"/>tion for him. Duryodhana returned to Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>Now the question was whether half of the kingdom
[Page432-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>should be given to the Pāṇḍavas or not. Śakuni and
<div n="lb"/>others advised Duryodhana to give it, but the latter
<div n="lb"/>remained adamant against it. Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to
<div n="lb"/>end his life and for the purpose spread darbha grass on
<div n="lb"/>earth and sat thereon. The Asuras heard about these
<div n="lb"/>developments and created a Kṛtyā by mantras. The
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtyā took Duryodhana to Pātāla where the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>advised him against any compromise with the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas. On the other hand they wanted him to intensify
<div n="lb"/>his hatred against the Pāṇḍavas, and they assured
<div n="lb"/>him all support. After that Kṛtyā took Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>back to Hastināpura. (Vana Parva, Chapter 252).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Kṛtyā born under the name Madana.%} Devendra once
<div n="lb"/>prevented the Aśvinīdevas from drinking Soma juice.
<div n="NI"/>(Devas drink a liquid-liqueur extracted from the soma
<div n="lb"/>creeper, during yajñas, and that is called Somapāna).
<div n="lb"/>Aggrieved at the orders of Indra the Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>wandered about the world in the course of which they
<div n="lb"/>approached sage Cyavana of the Bhārgava family.
<div n="lb"/>They restored sight to the blind Cyavana, who, in
<div n="lb"/>return, assured them that he would see to it that they
<div n="lb"/>got the right of drinking soma juice. Cyavana began
<div n="lb"/>a Yajña and Indra came for Somapāna. The sage
<div n="lb"/>invited the Aśvinīdevas also for Somapāna. Indra
<div n="lb"/>prevented them from doing so, and the sage opposed
<div n="lb"/>him. Then Indra drew his Vajrāyudha against Cyavana.
<div n="lb"/>The sage made Indra's hands paralysed. Further, he
<div n="lb"/>raised from the Yājñic fire a Kṛtyā which appeared in
<div n="lb"/>male form under the name Madana. Sharp molar
<div n="lb"/>teeth hundred yojanas long, other teeth each ten yoja-
<div n="lb"/>nas long, hands ten thousand yojanas long and as big
<div n="lb"/>as mountains, round eyes like the Sun and Moon,
<div n="lb"/>mouth spitting fire—such was Madana, the Kṛtyā, a
<div n="lb"/>really terrible being. Frightened at the sight of the
<div n="lb"/>terrible being Indra permitted the Aśvinīdevas to drink
<div n="lb"/>Soma.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Kṛtyā against Ambarīṣa.%} Ambarīṣa once began the
<div n="lb"/>Ekādaśī Vrata and the Devas deputed Durvāsas to
<div n="lb"/>obstruct it somehow or other. Durvāsas came to
<div n="lb"/>Ambarīṣa, who requested him to return after bath.
<div n="lb"/>But, though the vrata was over the sage did not return
<div n="lb"/>and Ambarīṣa fed the Devas with the offerings (havis).
<div n="lb"/>Immediately after that Durvāsas returned and com-
<div n="lb"/>plained that what he was given was the left-overs of
<div n="lb"/>the havis, By means of black art he created a Kṛtyā,
<div n="lb"/>who charged against Ambarīṣa's throat. Ambarīṣa
<div n="lb"/>prayed and the Sudarśana Cakra of Viṣṇu appeared and
<div n="lb"/>killed the Kṛtyā and drove Durvāsas round the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds. At last the sage sought refuge with Ambarīṣa
<div n="lb"/>himself and thus saved himself. (Bhāgavata, 9th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Kṛtyā opposed Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} While Kṛṣṇa was ruling
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā, Pauṇḍrakavāsudeva was the King of Kārūṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Once he sent a messenger to ask Kṛṣṇa to go and bow
<div n="lb"/>down before him as he was the real Vāsudeva. Enraged
<div n="lb"/>at this insolent demand Kṛṣṇa cut off Pauṇḍraka's head
<div n="lb"/>with the Sudarśana Cakra. The dead King's son,
<div n="lb"/>Sudakṣiṇa, to gather power enough to fight Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to Kāśī and performed penance to please Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva appeared and taught him the method of creating
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtyā. Accordingly he created from fire, a Kṛtyā, who
<div n="lb"/>dashed against Kṛṣṇa roaring like hell. Kṛṣṇa used the
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana Cakra, which burnt to death not only the
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtyā, but also Sudakṣiṇa.

<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kṛtyā against Prahlāda.%} To change the nature of
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda, a great devotee of Viṣṇu, his father Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu deputed Asura preceptors. But, severe punish-
<div n="lb"/>ments like poisoning, throwing into fire etc. did not
<div n="lb"/>succeed in changing the devotee's character. At last,
<div n="lb"/>the preceptors raised Kṛtyā from fire. The Śūlam,
<div n="lb"/>which Kṛtyā thrust against the throat of Prahlāda was
<div n="lb"/>broken into hundreds of pieces. Kṛtyā then got angry
<div n="lb"/>and turned against the preceptors, who had sent her
<div n="lb"/>against Prahlāda. The preceptors fell down unconscious
<div n="lb"/>on the verge of death. But, Prahlāda touched their
<div n="lb"/>bodies and they became alive again. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part 1, Chapter 18).
