AṢṬĀṄGAYOGA¦(S). Yama, Niyama, Āsana, Prāṇā-
<div n="lb"/>yāma, Pratyāhāra, Dhyāna, Dhāraṇā and Samādhi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Yama.%} That which prevents the yogīs from doing
<div n="lb"/>prohibited things. Ahiṃsā, Satya, Asteya, Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>carya and Aparigraha are yamas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Niyama.%} Actions leading to Mokṣa. They are:
<div n="NI"/>(1) ŚAUCA—Cleanliness of the mind—cleaning it of
<div n="lb"/>such bad qualities like jealousy. (2) TAPAS—indiffe-
<div n="lb"/>rence (Samatvabhāva) to the pairs of opposites like
<div n="lb"/>pleasure and pain, heat and cold etc. (3) Svādhyāya
<div n="lb"/>-pursuit of the science of salvation chanting of OM.
<div n="lb"/>(4) SANTOṢA—remaining happy and contented.
<div n="lb"/>(5) ĪŚVARA-PRAṆIDHĀNA—surrendering all ac-
<div n="lb"/>tions to God.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Āsana.%} Postures of sitting firmly and comfortably. Of
<div n="lb"/>the many āsanas the very prominent ones are: Svasti-
<div n="lb"/>kāsana, Vīrāsana, Padmāsana, Siddhāsana, Vastrāsana,
<div n="lb"/>Vyāghracarmāsana, Valkalāsana, Kuśāsana, Kṛṣṇāsana,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṭarāsana, Mayūrāsana and Kūrmāsana. Of these
<div n="lb"/>Siddhāsana is considered to be the best of the lot. This
<div n="lb"/>āsana strengthens the 72,000 nerves of the human system
<div n="lb"/>and all the yogīs prefer this to any other. “Kimanyaiḥ
<div n="lb"/>bahubhiḥ pīṭhaiḥ pīṭhe Siddhāsane sati” (of what use
<div n="lb"/>are the others when there is Siddhāsana).
[Page064-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Prāṇāyāma.%} Control of Prāṇa (Prāṇa is the life giving
<div n="lb"/>breath and āyāma is the checking of it). Select an airy
<div n="lb"/>place and be seated in an ordinary āsana facing north
<div n="lb"/>or east after taking your early morning bath. Sit erect
<div n="lb"/>with your breast slightly pushed forward and your head
<div n="lb"/>slightly drawn back. Then complete one Prāṇāyāma
<div n="lb"/>doing Pūraka, Kumbhaka and Recaka. The Rudrayā-
<div n="lb"/>mala states thus about Prāṇāyāma.
<Poem>Dakṣāṅguṣṭhena dakṣaṃ ca.
<div n="lb"/>Ghrāṇaṃ saṃpīḍya mantravit
<div n="lb"/>Īḍayā pūrayedvāyuṃ

<div n="NI"/>Closing the right nostril by the thumb of the right
<div n="lb"/>hand and inhaling air inside through the left nostril
<div n="lb"/>taking 16 seconds is called Pūraka. Closing the nostrils
<div n="lb"/>by the thumb and ring-finger and keeping the breath
<div n="lb"/>for 64 seconds is called Kumbhaka. Closing the left
<div n="lb"/>nostril well and then exhaling through the right nost-
<div n="lb"/>ril taking 32 seconds is called Recaka. Pūrakas should
<div n="lb"/>be done through the same nostril through which you
<div n="lb"/>have done Recaka. (You must do at least ten Prāṇā-
<div n="lb"/>yāmas at a time).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Pratyāhāra.%} Withdrawing the mind from worldly
<div n="lb"/>objects and sensuous pleasures.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Dhyāna.%} Keeping your mind fixed on the tip of your
<div n="lb"/>nose. Meditation.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Dhāraṇa.%} Steadily thinking of things you should know.
<div n="lb"/>Concentration.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Samādhi.%} The union of mind with God. This is a
<div n="lb"/>blissful superconscious state in which one perceives the
<div n="lb"/>identity of the individualised soul and cosmic spirit.
<div n="lb"/>(Yogābhyāsa).
