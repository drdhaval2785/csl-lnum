AṢṬAVASU¦(S).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Gaṇadevatās are called Aṣṭavasus. They
<div n="lb"/>were born to Dharmadeva of his wife Vasu, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa. They are: Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Ahar, Anila,
<div n="lb"/>Anala, Pratyūṣa and Prabhāsa. (Ślokas 17 and 18,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 66, Ādi Parva, M.B.). There is a version in
<div n="lb"/>certain purāṇas that the Aṣṭavasus are the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>Different purāṇas give different names to these Aṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>vasus. According to Viṣṇu Purāṇa they are: Āpa,
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Anala, Pratyūṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāsa. (Chapter 15 of Aṃśam 1). In Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>they are Droṇa, Prāṇa, Dhruva, Arka, Agni, Doṣa,
<div n="NI"/>Vasu and Vibhāvasu. In Harivaṃśa they are: Akha,
<div n="lb"/>Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Anila, Anala, Pratyūṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāsa. This only indicates that some of these have
<div n="lb"/>two or more names for them.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse of Vasiṣṭha.%} Once the Aṣṭavasus were enjoy-
<div n="lb"/>ing a picnic with their wives and they happened to go
<div n="lb"/>to the āśrama of Vasiṣṭha. One of the wives got ena-
<div n="lb"/>moured over Nandinī, Vasiṣṭha's beautiful cow and
<div n="lb"/>wanted it. The Vasu to please his wife took the cow by
<div n="lb"/>force and left the place. When the sage found his cow
<div n="lb"/>missing after some time he understood by his divine
<div n="lb"/>powers who stole the cow and so he cursed the Aṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>vasus saying that all of them would be born on earth as
<div n="lb"/>men. The Aṣṭavasus were greatly worried and approach-
<div n="lb"/>ed the sage apologising and craving for pardon. The sage
<div n="lb"/>relaxed the curse and declared that their life on earth
<div n="lb"/>would be only for a very short time maintaining that
<div n="lb"/>the particular Vasu who committed the theft would live
<div n="lb"/>for a long time as man. It was this Vasu, Āpa (Dyau)
<div n="lb"/>who was born as Bhīṣma.
[Page066-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Rebirth of Aṣṭavasus.%} The Aṣṭa vasus were pondering
<div n="lb"/>over the curse and were thinking of how to bear it
<div n="lb"/>without hardship when Gaṅgādevī appeared before them
<div n="lb"/>and they then appealed to her: “Devī, if you become
<div n="lb"/>the queen on earth of some noble King we shall be born
<div n="lb"/>as your sons and you must throw us into the river as
<div n="lb"/>soon as we are born”. Gaṅgādevī accepted their request.
<div n="lb"/>Once there was a King called Pratīpa in the Candra
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. One day when this ascetic King was worship-
<div n="lb"/>ping Sūrya on the banks of the river Gaṅgā a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>damsel arose from the waters and sat on the right
<div n="lb"/>thigh of the King. Surprised the King told her thus, “Oh
<div n="lb"/>beautiful maiden, who are you? Do you realise what
<div n="lb"/>unrighteous thing you have done? I am not one who
<div n="lb"/>goes after women and it was a bit daring of you to
<div n="lb"/>have taken me as a beau. Please understand that the
<div n="lb"/>right thigh is intended for a daughter and daughter-in-
<div n="lb"/>law. You can claim this right when you become the
<div n="lb"/>wife of my son.” The beautiful girl was none other than
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādevī herself and she disappeared soon on receiving
<div n="lb"/>the rebuke.
<div n="NI"/>Pratīpa got a son named Śantanu and Gaṅgādevī be-
<div n="lb"/>came the wife of Śantanu. (For more details about this
<div n="lb"/>see under Gaṅgā). When Gaṅgādevī became the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu she made a condition to be his queen.
<div n="lb"/>“Whether good or bad you should not obstruct any
<div n="lb"/>action of mine. You must never give me any opinion of
<div n="lb"/>yours on any matter. You must obey what I order. If at
<div n="lb"/>any time you break any of these promises I will leave
<div n="lb"/>you that instant.”
<div n="NI"/>It was while Gaṅgādevī was living on earth as the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Śantanu that the Aṣṭavasus were born to her. One
<div n="lb"/>after the other she threw into the river seven sons but
<div n="lb"/>when she was about to throw the eighth the King
<div n="lb"/>objected to it and Gaṅgā disappeared immediately. That
<div n="lb"/>son was Bhīṣma, who was none other than Dyau born
<div n="lb"/>on earth by the curse of Vasiṣṭha. All the others, released
<div n="lb"/>from the curse, went to heaven. (More details under
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%A missile to Bhīṣma.%} When Bhīṣma had to fight against
<div n="lb"/>his guru, Paraśurāma, the Aṣṭavasus gave him the
<div n="lb"/>missile, Prasvāpā. (See Ambā) (Ślokas 11 to 13, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>183, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Sons of Aṣṭavasus.%} The sons of Āpa, the first of the
<div n="lb"/>Vasus, are: Vaitaṇḍha, Śrama, Śānta and Dhvani. Kāla,
<div n="lb"/>the destroyer of all, is the son of Dhruva. Varcas is the
<div n="lb"/>son of Soma. Dharma got of his wife Manoharī five sons
<div n="lb"/>Draviṇa, Hutahavyavāha, Śiśira, Prāṇa and Varuṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Śivā was Anila's wife and she got two sons, Manojava
<div n="lb"/>and Avijñātagati. Agni's son Kumāra was born at
<div n="lb"/>Śarastamba. Kumāra got three brothers, Śākha, Viśākha
<div n="lb"/>and Naigameya. Kumāra is known as Kārttikeya
<div n="lb"/>because he was born of Kṛttikas. The sage, Devala is
<div n="lb"/>the son of Pratyūṣa. Devala got two sons of great intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gence and forbearance. Varastrī, sister of Bṛhaspati and
<div n="lb"/>a woman of great yogic powers and world-wide travels
<div n="lb"/>became the wife of Prabhāsa. She gave birth to the
<div n="lb"/>famous Viśvakarmaprajāpati. He was the inventor of a
<div n="lb"/>great many handicrafts and ornaments He became the
<div n="lb"/>consulting architect of the devas and ranked first in that
<div n="lb"/>art. The aeroplanes of the devas were designed by him.
<div n="lb"/>Men on earth depend on his art even now. That archi-
<div n="lb"/>tect had four sons: Ajaikapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā
<div n="lb"/>and Rudra, the bold. The great ascetics, Viśvarūpa,
<div n="lb"/>Hara, Bahurūpa, Tryambaka, Aparājita, Vṛṣākapi,
[Page066-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Śambhu, Kapardi, Raivata, Mṛgavyādha, Śarva and
<div n="lb"/>Kapāli were the sons of Tvaṣṭā. These are known as the
<div n="lb"/>twelve Rudras. Purāṇas say that there are a hundred
<div n="lb"/>Rudras like this. (Chapter 15, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
