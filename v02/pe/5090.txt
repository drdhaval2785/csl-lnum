PĀTĀLA¦. The last of the seven regions or worlds under
<div n="lb"/>the earth said to be peopled by Nāgas. The seven
<div n="lb"/>regions one below the other are (1) Atala (2) Vitala
<div n="lb"/>(3) Sutala (4) Talātala (5) Rasātala (6) Mahātala and
<div n="lb"/>(7) Pātāla. In all these regions there are beautiful cities
<div n="lb"/>and buildings built by Maya, the great architect. The
<div n="lb"/>daityas, dānavas and nāgas live in these regions.
<div n="NI"/>Pātāla is seventy thousand yojanas high each division
<div n="lb"/>being ten thousand yojanas high. The earth in these
[Page581-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>regions is of different hue like white, black, red and
<div n="lb"/>yellow. It is filled with rubbles, black granite and
<div n="lb"/>gold. Once Nārada on his return to Svarga from
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla said that Pātāla was more beautiful than Svarga.
<div n="lb"/>The ornaments worn by nāgas are profusely studded
<div n="lb"/>with shining diamonds. Daytime is lighted by the Sun
<div n="lb"/>and the night by the Moon. There is neither heat nor
<div n="lb"/>cold there and the happy nāgas living contentedly do
<div n="lb"/>not feel the passage of time.
<div n="NI"/>Under the Pātāla is Ādiśeṣa, a tāmasic form of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu, known to the Siddhas as Ananta. He has a thousand
<div n="lb"/>heads and Svastika as his badge. Holding in one hand
<div n="lb"/>a plough and in the other a wooden pestle he sits wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped by Śrīdevī and Vāruṇīdevī. At the time of the
<div n="lb"/>end of the world the Saṅkarṣaṇamūrti, Rudra, is born
<div n="lb"/>from the face of Ādiśeṣa shining brightly like poisonous
<div n="lb"/>fire and it consumes all the three worlds. Ādiśeṣa
<div n="lb"/>worshipped by all gods bears this earth on his head
<div n="lb"/>like a crown and sits in Pātāla. When Ananta yawns
<div n="lb"/>this world begins to quake along with its oceans, rivers
<div n="lb"/>and forests. Nobody has seen an end of his qualities
<div n="lb"/>and that is why he is known as Ananta (no end). It
<div n="lb"/>was by worshipping this Ananta that the ancient sage
<div n="lb"/>Garga learned the truth about the results of Nimittaśā-
<div n="lb"/>stra (predictions by omens) a division of Jyotiṣa-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra.
<div n="NI"/>The distinguishing characteristics of each of the seven
<div n="lb"/>divisions of Pātāla are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Atala.%} The first region of Pātāla. Here lives Bala,
<div n="lb"/>the celebrated son of Maya. He has created ninetysix
<div n="lb"/>kinds of magical arts capable of giving everything one
<div n="lb"/>desires. Those interested in magic are even now using
<div n="lb"/>some of these. When Bala yawns three kinds of women
<div n="lb"/>will come out of his mouth. Puṃścalīs (harlots),
<div n="lb"/>Svairiṇīs (adulteresses) and Kāminīs (lustful maidens).
<div n="lb"/>These women have a charm called Hāṭaka to tempt
<div n="lb"/>all who enter Atala. This hāṭaka is a rasāyana which
<div n="lb"/>will excite sexual passion in men so that the women
<div n="lb"/>can enjoy a sexual life with them for a prolonged period.
<div n="lb"/>These women after enticing the men would live with
<div n="lb"/>them enjoying a life of bliss produced by bewitching side
<div n="lb"/>glances, charming smiles, erotic embraces and exciting
<div n="lb"/>amorous talks. The men who live with them will be
<div n="lb"/>in such a state of bliss that they would say with
<div n="lb"/>pride “I am perfect, I am god. I am one with the
<div n="lb"/>might of ten thousand elephants.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Vitala.%} This is the abode of Hāṭakeśvara who is
<div n="lb"/>none other than Paramaśiva. This god accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by Bhavānīdevī and surrounded by pramathagaṇas
<div n="lb"/>(prominent demigods who attend on him) and wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped by devas, presides over this place increasing
<div n="lb"/>the prajās created by Brahmā. The semen virile of
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī-Parameśvaras flows there as the river Hāṭakī.
<div n="lb"/>The gold named Hāṭaka is what is vomited by the
<div n="lb"/>wind-blown Agni after drinking the rasa of that river.
<div n="lb"/>The wives of daityas wear ornaments made of this
<div n="lb"/>gold.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sutala.%} This is the abode of Mahābali. Here lives
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali meditating on Mahāviṣṇu with more glory
<div n="lb"/>and grandeur than Indra. To please Indra, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu once went to Mahābali on earth and by deceit
<div n="lb"/>took all his possessions and binding him with
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇapāśa pushed him to Sutala through a hole made
[Page581-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>on earth. Later Mahāviṣṇu felt he did a wrong in
<div n="lb"/>thus sending away Mahābali from earth by deceit and
<div n="lb"/>to remedy the sin committed he even now acts as a
<div n="lb"/>gatekeeper to Mahābali in Sutala. Once Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to Sutala to attack Mahābali and then Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>keeping watch over the palace-gate in the form of
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana gave Rāvaṇa a kick and sent him back.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Talātala.%} This is the place where Maya lives. This
<div n="lb"/>Maya is a mighty magician among demons. After the
<div n="lb"/>Tripuradahana (burning the three demons to death)
<div n="lb"/>Śiva blessed Maya and the latter is living as Tripurā-
<div n="lb"/>dhipati (chief of Tripura) in Talātala. Maya is the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor of all demon-magicians and many fierce-
<div n="lb"/>looking demons worship him always.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Mahātala.%} This is the abode of Kādraveyas. They
<div n="lb"/>got the name because they are all children of Kadrū,
<div n="lb"/>the cobra. All these cobras are fierce-looking multi-
<div n="lb"/>headed ill-tempered ones. The prominent ones among
<div n="lb"/>them are Kuhaka, Takṣaka, Suṣena and Kāliya. All
<div n="lb"/>these are long lean serpents possessing big hoods and
<div n="lb"/>great strength. These bad-tempered cobras live with
<div n="lb"/>their family terribly afraid of Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Rasātala.%} This is the residence of the notorious
<div n="lb"/>Nivātakavaca-Kālakeyas. They were enemies of the
<div n="lb"/>devas and they tormented them in many ways. The
<div n="lb"/>majestic authority of Mahāviṣṇu decreased their
<div n="lb"/>virility. They are now living in Rasātala frightened by
<div n="lb"/>the threats and beatings with a magic wand of Saramā,
<div n="lb"/>a mantrarūpiṇi (a sacred chant incarnate) deputed by
<div n="lb"/>Indra.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Pātāla.%} This is the abode of serpents. The
<div n="lb"/>nāgalokādhipatis (chiefs of the serpent world) like
<div n="lb"/>Vāsuki, Śaṅkha, Gulika, Śveta, Dhanañjaya Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>śikha, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Saṅkhacūḍa, Kambala, Aśvadhara
<div n="lb"/>and Devadatta live here. These are all strong, long-
<div n="lb"/>bodied, greatly poisonous snakes with very bad tempers.
<div n="lb"/>They all possess hoods varying in numbers from five to
<div n="lb"/>hundred and the lustre of the diamonds on their hoods
<div n="lb"/>keeps the region of Pātāla always illuminated. At the
<div n="lb"/>base of this Pātāla-world is a place, separated from the
<div n="lb"/>rest, thirty thousand yojanas in area. It is here that
<div n="lb"/>the tāmasic Viṣṇukalā resides under the name Ananta.
<div n="lb"/>Ādiśeṣa or Ananta is the manifestation of this Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>kalā. Śrī Ananta has got a name Saṅkarṣaṇa meaning
<div n="lb"/>one who proudly and arrogantly pulls at every thing
<div n="lb"/>that is seen and unseen.
<div n="NI"/>It is well-known that all the worlds are being borne on
<div n="lb"/>his head by the thousand-hooded Ādiśeṣa. When,
<div n="lb"/>while bearing the worlds like this, he feels that he
<div n="lb"/>should destroy the animate and inanimate objects of
<div n="lb"/>the worlds, he brings forth from his forehead Rudra
<div n="lb"/>named Saṅkarṣaṇa with eleven demigods and weapons
<div n="lb"/>like triśūla (trident). Ananta is very beautiful with
<div n="lb"/>divine brilliance. Other serpent chiefs prostrate before
<div n="lb"/>him and at that time they see their reflection on the
<div n="lb"/>diamond-mirror-like nails on the toes of Ananta and
<div n="lb"/>for some time the serpent chiefs lie there pleasantly
<div n="lb"/>looking at the reflection of thier own faces in the nails.
<div n="lb"/>The earrings of dazzling brilliance worn by these ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent chiefs reflect on their cheeks and the serpents feel
<div n="lb"/>extremely happy when they see the reflection of their
<div n="lb"/>faces on the nails.
<div n="NI"/>The daughters of the serpent kings are all beautiful
<div n="lb"/>damsels with fair, spotless and lustrous bodies. They
[Page582-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>smear their bodies with fragrant pastes made from Aloe,
<div n="lb"/>Sandal and Saffron. They then stand around Ādiśeṣa
<div n="lb"/>with their bewitching smiles and amorous movements of
<div n="lb"/>their bodies accompanied by erotic side glances express-
<div n="lb"/>ing their carnal desires. The mighty, virtuous, celebrat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Ādiśeṣa sits there surrounded by serpents for the
<div n="lb"/>welfare of the world. He sits there worshipped by
<div n="lb"/>Devas, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Vidyādharas and Maha-
<div n="lb"/>rṣis, bearing the divine garland ‘Vaijayantī’, and
<div n="lb"/>wearing fragrant flower garlands, blue apparels and
<div n="lb"/>ornaments in ears and neck and holding in his hand the
<div n="lb"/>Halāyudha. Suppressing his anger and keeping calm
<div n="lb"/>and serene he pleases all around with his pathetic look.
<div n="lb"/>(9th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
