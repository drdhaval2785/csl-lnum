GIRIKĀ¦. Wife of Uparicaravasu. This gem of a lady
<div n="lb"/>was the daughter of the river Śuktimatī. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>behind her marrying Uparicara.
<div n="NI"/>Śuktimatī was a river flowing through the capital city
<div n="lb"/>of the kingdom of Uparicara. Once the mountain
<div n="lb"/>Kolāhala driven by amorous desires subdued Śuktimatī.
<div n="lb"/>The next morning on finding no river in its place the
<div n="lb"/>people were surprised. The news reached the ears of the
<div n="lb"/>King. He became furious and rushing to the mountain
<div n="lb"/>gave it a hard kick. It created a hole in the mountain
<div n="lb"/>and the river flowed through it. But by that time
<div n="lb"/>Kolāhala had got a son and a daughter of Śuktimatī.
<div n="lb"/>Greatly pleased at the King for setting her free from
<div n="lb"/>Kolāhala, Śuktimatī gave her children to the King. The
<div n="lb"/>King brought up the son and made him the chief of his
<div n="lb"/>army. The girl was brought up and named Girikā and
<div n="lb"/>when she was of marriageable age the King married her.
<div n="NI"/>When once Girikā was having her monthly period the
<div n="lb"/>King was forced to go to the forests for hunting. While
<div n="lb"/>in the forests he saw the animals having sexual acts and
<div n="lb"/>as he thought of Girikā at home he had emission. He
<div n="lb"/>never wanted to waste the seminal fluid. He wrapped it
<div n="lb"/>in a leaf and sent it to his wife through a kite. Another
<div n="lb"/>kite thinking it to be something to eat attacked the packet
<div n="lb"/>and it fell into a river down below. A fish swallowed it
<div n="lb"/>and later when a fisherman caught it and opened its
<div n="lb"/>belly a boy and a girl came out of it. The girl was
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī mother of Vyāsa. (10th Skandha, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
