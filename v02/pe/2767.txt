INDRAPŪJĀ¦. This pūjā (Indra-worship) is also
<div n="lb"/>called Indrotsava. It was during the reign of Vasu,
<div n="lb"/>a king of the lunar dynasty that Indrotsava began
<div n="lb"/>being celebrated in an organised manner. Pleased at
<div n="lb"/>the long penance of Vasu, Indra appeared to him and
<div n="lb"/>presented a Veṇudaṇḍa. Vasu planted the daṇḍa on
<div n="lb"/>earth and conducted Indrapūjā. Thenceforward raising
<div n="lb"/>the Veṇudaṇḍa became the first item in celebrating
<div n="lb"/>Indrotsava. The staff is decorated with flowers, sandal,
<div n="lb"/>garlands etc. To the top of the staff is attached the
<div n="lb"/>form of a Haṃsa and offerings are given to it. The
<div n="lb"/>reason for this is the fact that it was in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>Haṃsa that Indra appeared to Vasu. Pleased by the
<div n="lb"/>Indrapūjā of Vasu, Indra announced as follows:—If
<div n="lb"/>men, and especially kings worship me in the manner
<div n="lb"/>done by Vasu, prosperity and welfare will accrue to
<div n="lb"/>them and to their kingdoms. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>63).
