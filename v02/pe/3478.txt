KEŚINĪ V¦. Once there arose a quarrel between Sudh-
<div n="lb"/>anvā, the son of Aṅgiras, and Virocana the son of Prah-
<div n="lb"/>lāda, because both wanted to marry the same girl
<div n="lb"/>named Keśinī. Sudhanvā was a Brahmin whereas
<div n="lb"/>Virocana was an Asura, who argued that Asura was
<div n="lb"/>nobler than Brahmin and Sudhanvā said that it was the
<div n="lb"/>other way. Both wagered their lives and accepted
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda as their judge. The decision of Prahlāda was
[Page407-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>that the Brahmin was the nobler of the two. Because
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda said the truth Sudhanvā did not kill Viro-
<div n="lb"/>cana. But Virocana had to wash the feet of Sudhanvā
<div n="lb"/>in the presence of Keśinī, feet Sudhanvā married
<div n="lb"/>Keśinī in the presence of Virocana. (M.B. Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 35).
