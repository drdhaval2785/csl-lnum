PUṢPARĀGAPRĀKĀRA¦. (RATNAŚĀLĀ). The Purā-
<div n="lb"/>ṇas state about a fort made of diamonds called Puṣpa-
<div n="lb"/>rāga shining red above the heavenly place called
<div n="lb"/>Maṇidvīpa above Brahmaloka. This fort is seven
<div n="lb"/>yojanas high. All things inside it, the ground, the trees,
<div n="lb"/>the birds, the animals, plants, creepers and gardens are
<div n="lb"/>puṣparāga-studded and look red like saffron. Therefore
<div n="lb"/>the fort is called Ratnaśālā also. All the dikpālakas of
<div n="lb"/>the universe live with their family and attendants in
<div n="lb"/>this fort. (12th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
