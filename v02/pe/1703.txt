DĀMODARA¦. Śrī Kṛṣṇa. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa was a small
<div n="lb"/>boy, Yaśodā tied him to a mortar-stone. The boy ran
<div n="lb"/>about, dragging the heavy stone with him and the rope
<div n="lb"/>snapped. Part of the rope still remained round his
<div n="lb"/>abdomen. From that he got the name Dāmodara.
<div n="lb"/>“Dama” means rope and “Udara” means abdomen.
<div n="lb"/>(See Kṛṣṇa).
