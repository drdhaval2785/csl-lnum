<F>1) Mahābhārata Aśvamedha Parva (Chapter 4) says that Mahābāhu was the son of Vaivasvata Manu, Prasandhi was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Mahābāhu, Kṣupa was the son of Prasandhi and Ikṣvāku was the son of Kṣupa.</F> A son of Vaivasvata Manu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the
<div n="lb"/>following order—Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān
<div n="lb"/>-Vaivasvata Manu—Ikṣvāku.
<div n="NI"/>Śraddhā, Vaivasvata Manu's wife bore him ten sons—
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku, Nṛga, Śaryāti, Diṣṭa, Dhṛṣṭa, Karūṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Nariṣyanta, Nābhāga, Pṛṣadhra and Kavi. Vaivasvata
<div n="lb"/>Manu had six more sons by another wife, Chāyā. They
<div n="lb"/>were Manu, Yama, Yamī, Aśvinīkumāra, Revanta,
<div n="lb"/>Sudyumna. The Ikṣvāku family takes its source from
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku. The Kings of the solar dynasty were all born
<div n="lb"/>in the Ikṣvāku family. This dynasty is named “Solar
<div n="lb"/>Dynasty” because Ikṣvāku was born to Vivasvān (Sun)
<div n="lb"/>the son of Kaśyapa. In Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha
<div n="lb"/>we see that Ikṣvāku was born from Manu's spittle. The
<div n="lb"/>descendants of Ikṣvāku up to Śrī Rāmā's sons Lava and
