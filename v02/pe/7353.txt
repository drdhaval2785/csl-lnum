SUVARṆATĪRTHA¦. A very ancient holy spot in
<div n="lb"/>India. Before creation Mahāviṣṇu once did penance
<div n="lb"/>here to please Rudra who appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>granted him boons. That is the great importance of
<div n="lb"/>the place. He who worships Śiva here will derive
<div n="lb"/>benefits equal to those of conducting an Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>yajña and also will attain the status of Gaṇapati.
<div n="lb"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 18).
