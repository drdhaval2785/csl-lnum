DROṆA I¦. The teacher in archery of the Pāṇḍavas and
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Droṇa was the son of Bharadvāja who had his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage erected on the bank of the Ganges. Once
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja went to bathe in the river. When he got
<div n="lb"/>into the river he saw the celestial maid Ghṛtācī. The cele-
<div n="lb"/>stial maid ran away as soon as she saw the hermit. But
<div n="lb"/>her cloth was caught in grass and slipped off her body.
<div n="lb"/>When the hermit saw the complete form of her body
<div n="lb"/>which was bright and beautiful, he had seminal discharge.
<div n="lb"/>The discharged semen was kept in a Droṇa (trough).
<div n="lb"/>A child was born from that and he was named
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa, who was brought up in the hermitage. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Education and Marriage.%} Droṇa learned the art of
<div n="lb"/>using weapons from his father and the hermit Agniveśa.
<div n="lb"/>Drupada the prince of Pāñcāla was the fellow student
<div n="lb"/>of Droṇa. They became great friends. On completion
<div n="lb"/>of education Drupada returned to Pāñcāla. Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>married Kṛpī the daughter of Śaradvān. A son was born
<div n="lb"/>to them. At his birth the child neighed like the horse
<div n="lb"/>Uccaiḥśravas; so his parents named him Aśvatthāmā.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing that Paras urāma was giving Brāhmaṇas free
<div n="lb"/>gift of wealth and property, Droṇa reached there.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa's desire was to get Dhanurveda (the art of
<div n="lb"/>archery). Droṇa with his disciples went to Mahendra-
<div n="lb"/>giri and saw Paraśurāma, who was about to enter forest
<div n="lb"/>giving away everything he had. Paraśurāma said, “I
<div n="lb"/>have given away to the Brāhmaṇas gold and everything
<div n="lb"/>I had. The land I had conquered is given to Kaśyapa.
<div n="lb"/>Now there remains only my body and some weapons.
<div n="lb"/>You can have one of them.”
<div n="NI"/>Droṇa preferred the weapons. Thus Droṇa got the
<div n="lb"/>entire armoury of Paraśurāma. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%He became the teacher of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas.%}
<div n="lb"/>After receiving dhanurveda from Paraśurāma Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to Pāñcāla. Drupada who had been a fellow
<div n="lb"/>student of Droṇa was the King of Uttarapañcāla. then.
<div n="lb"/>Though Droṇa had become proficient in archery, he
<div n="lb"/>was very poor.
<div n="NI"/>He had no money even to buy milk for his child. Once
<div n="lb"/>the playmates of Aśvatthāmā made him drink a mix-
<div n="lb"/>ture of water and flour saying that it was milk. So
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa approached Drupada for financial help. But
<div n="lb"/>Drupada shunned his fellow student, scolded him and
<div n="lb"/>sent him away without giving any help. Droṇa vowed
<div n="lb"/>that he would, somehow or other, take revenge upon
<div n="lb"/>Drupada and departed from Pāñcāla.
<div n="NI"/>The aim of Droṇa was to get some capable disciples. He
<div n="lb"/>reached Hastināpura and stayed in disguise with Gautama
<div n="lb"/>for a while. Once the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas who
<div n="lb"/>were boys were engaged in the game of Kāra (a kind
<div n="lb"/>of cricket play) outside the palace premises. The ball
<div n="lb"/>fell in a well by chance. The princess stood round the
<div n="lb"/>well and began to ponder how to get the ‘ball’ out of
<div n="lb"/>the well. They tried all means but in vain. At that
<div n="lb"/>time a Brāhmaṇa of dark complexion, short and aged,
<div n="lb"/>came by that way. It was Droṇa. The boys gathered
<div n="lb"/>round the old man. Droṇa threw his ring also into the
<F>1. To take revenge on Drupada was the thought that was uppermost in the mind of Droṇa.</F>
[Page248-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>well and said: “Your kingly qualities are very poor.
<div n="lb"/>Your education in using weapons is not complete. If
<div n="lb"/>you give me a meal I will get both the ring and the
<div n="lb"/>ball together” The boys agreed to the conditions.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa took a grass and evoked arrow into it by mantra
<div n="lb"/>(spell) and shot it at the ‘Kāra’. The next grass was
<div n="lb"/>shot at the first grass. It struck the first grass. Thus he
<div n="lb"/>shot grasses one after another till the grass reached the
<div n="lb"/>brink of the well and by pulling the grass he took the ball
<div n="lb"/>out. In the same way he took the ring also out of the
<div n="lb"/>well. When they got the ‘Kāra’ the boys stood round
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa and asked him what he would like as the reward
<div n="lb"/>for his deed. Droṇa said that they need only tell Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>how a short man of dark complexion took the ball out of
<div n="lb"/>the well. Accordingly the boys went to Bhīṣma and
<div n="lb"/>told him everything. Immediately Bhīṣma understood
<div n="lb"/>that it was Droṇa. Bhīṣma thought that Droṇa was the
<div n="lb"/>best person to teach the princes. So Droṇa was brought to
<div n="lb"/>the palace and was engaged as the teacher in archery.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 130 and 131).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Education in Archery of the Kauravas and reward.%}
<div n="NI"/>(a) {%First vow.%} Droṇa asked the Pāṇḍavas and the Kau-
<div n="lb"/>ravas to sit together and then told them. “There is one
<div n="lb"/>thing that you should do for me when your education
<div n="lb"/>is over”. Hearing this they all kept silent. But Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>came forward and took the vow that he would achieve
<div n="lb"/>that task according to the wish of the teacher.
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) The disciple who is second to none.%} The training in
<div n="lb"/>weapons commenced. Hearing of the fame of Droṇa,
<div n="lb"/>disciples came from places far and near. Arjuna was
<div n="lb"/>the first of all the students. Sending all the students to
<div n="lb"/>fetch water Droṇa taught his son Aśvatthāmā certain
<div n="lb"/>special lessons. Arjuna secretly knew this. So he
<div n="lb"/>brought water as quickly as possible before the others.
<div n="lb"/>As Droṇa loved his brilliant student Arjuna, he taught
<div n="lb"/>both his son and Arjuna alike the secrets. Seeing the
<div n="lb"/>brilliance of Arjuna Droṇa ordered the cook not to seat
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna in a dark place for meals. Yet it happened once
<div n="lb"/>that the light was extinguished by wind while the prin-
<div n="lb"/>ces were having their meals. All sat still, without eating,
<div n="lb"/>while Arjuna alone ate his food. From this Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>discovered that without seeing the object one could hit
<div n="lb"/>the target by constant practice. Droṇa was greatly
<div n="lb"/>pleased at this and embracing him promised to try to
<div n="lb"/>make him such an expert that there would be none
<div n="lb"/>equal to him in archery.
<div n="NI"/>{%(c) Ekalavya.%} Once Arjuna and the other disciples went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest for a hunt and there they met Ekalavya
<div n="lb"/>who was superior to Arjuna in archery. This Ekalavya
<div n="lb"/>had once approached Droṇa to learn archery from him.
<div n="lb"/>But it was against the rule for a Brahmin to teach a
<div n="lb"/>forester the art of fighting. So Ekalavya returned to the
<div n="lb"/>forest and making an earthen image of Droṇa worshipp-
<div n="lb"/>ed it and began self-learning in archery. Now he had
<div n="lb"/>become superior to Arjuna in archery. The teacher
<div n="lb"/>had said that none would be equal to Arjuna in archery.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna told Droṇa about Ekalavya. The teacher went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest and got the thumb of Ekalavya as the
<div n="lb"/>reward due to the teacher. Since then Ekalavya became
<div n="lb"/>a great archer though only of a lower level than Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>(See under Ekalavya).
<div n="NI"/>{%d) Expert disciple.%} The education in archery and the
<div n="lb"/>use of weapons was nearing completion. In archery
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna was second to none. Duryodhana and Bhīma
[Page249-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>became expert club-men. Aśvatthāmā was the first in
<div n="lb"/>the secrets of archery. Nakula and Sahadeva became
<div n="lb"/>expert swordsmen. Arjuna was expert in all branches of
<div n="lb"/>weapon-training. Bhīma had bodily strength and Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>had the strength of learning. Yudhiṣṭhira was the fore-
<div n="lb"/>most in chariot-fighting.
<div n="NI"/>e) {%Artificial bird.%} Once Droṇa placed an artificial bird
<div n="lb"/>on the branch of a tree without the knowledge of the
<div n="lb"/>princes, to test their practice in archery. Then he
<div n="lb"/>placed his disciples with their bows, around the tree,
<div n="lb"/>and told them to shoot the bird down at his command.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa first called Dharmaputra and told him to look
<div n="lb"/>at the bird. Then he asked him what he saw. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra said that he saw the bird, the tree, the teacher
<div n="lb"/>and the students. He tested one by one. All gave the
<div n="lb"/>same reply, that Dharmaputra gave. At last he asked
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. Arjuna stood for a while, taking aim and said
<div n="lb"/>that he saw a bird only. The teacher commanded to
<div n="lb"/>shoot and Arjuna sent an arrow. At the first shot the bird
<div n="lb"/>fell down headless. With this test Droṇa understood that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna could defeat Drupada and embraced his
<div n="lb"/>disciple.
<div n="NI"/>{%(f) Droṇa caught by a crocodile.%} Once Droṇa and his
<div n="lb"/>disciples went to bathe in the Ganges. While they were
<div n="lb"/>dipping and splashing in the water a crocodile caught
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa by the leg. Droṇa was unable to extricate
<div n="lb"/>himself from the grip of the crocodile. So he asked his
<div n="lb"/>disciples to shoot the crocodile and kill it. All stood
<div n="lb"/>agape. Arjuna at once took bow and arrows and sent
<div n="lb"/>five arrows one after another at the crocodile, which
<div n="lb"/>died instantly and came afloat. The teacher, who
<div n="lb"/>was much pleased, got out of the water and embraced
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna and taught him ‘Brahma Śirāstra’, a divine
<div n="lb"/>weapon. After imparting this knowledge Droṇa told
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna not to operate this weapon on man. But if an
<div n="lb"/>enemy superior to man attacked him, then only, he
<div n="lb"/>should send this missile at him to kill him.
<div n="NI"/>Giving due respect to the advice of the teacher, Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>received the Brahmaśirāstra. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 133).
<div n="NI"/>g) {%Demonstration by the pupils.%} When the training of the prin-
<div n="lb"/>ces terminated, Dhṛtarāṣṭra accorded sanction to hold a
<div n="lb"/>demonstration of weapon-play, by the princes. An
<div n="lb"/>arena was got ready. Droṇa entered the arena. As a
<div n="lb"/>preliminary rite Droṇa worshipped the gods. Then he
<div n="lb"/>invited Brāhmaṇas to bless his pupils. After that the
<div n="lb"/>pupils gave the teacher, gold, precious stones, cloths,
<div n="lb"/>and other costly things. The princes paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>to their teacher. The teacher gave his blessings to
<div n="lb"/>them. With this the demonstration commenced.
<div n="lb"/>Clubbing between Duryodhana and Bhīma was a
<div n="lb"/>terrible one. But the mock fighting changed to a seri-
<div n="lb"/>ous fight. Droṇa sent Aśvatthāmā who separated them.
<div n="lb"/>The audience applauded their performance. The per-
<div n="lb"/>formance of Arjuna was of the most superior type and
<div n="lb"/>the audience and the teacher were struck with wonder
<div n="lb"/>at his extraordinary capability. Karṇa also showed
<div n="lb"/>his performance. (For details see under Arjuna, Para 1
<div n="lb"/>and Karṇa, Para 4). (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 133
<div n="lb"/>and 134).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Revenge upon Drupada.%} When demonstration came to
<div n="lb"/>an end it was the time for giving the teacher the gift
<div n="lb"/>due to him. The teacher had, at the beginning, told
<div n="lb"/>his pupils that on completion of the training they should
<div n="lb"/>give him a gift. Accordingly he demanded that Drupada,
[Page249-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the King of Pāñcāla, should be brought before him with
<div n="lb"/>his hands tied. As soon as Duryodhana and Karṇa heard
<div n="lb"/>this they rapidly marched to Pāñcāla and engaged
<div n="lb"/>Drupada in a fight but were defeated by Drupada. After
<div n="lb"/>that Arjuna entered the battle-field, defeated and tied
<div n="lb"/>Drupada and brought him before Droṇa who was kind
<div n="lb"/>enough not to kill Drupada. The Kingdom of Pāñcāla
<div n="lb"/>was divided into two. Drupada was given Uttara-Pāñ-
<div n="lb"/>cāla and Droṇa took Dakṣiṇa Pāñcāla. Then Drupada
<div n="lb"/>was released. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 137).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Arjuna is accorded sanction to fight with his teacher.%} One
<div n="lb"/>year after the revenge on Drupada Yudhiṣṭhira was
<div n="lb"/>anointed as heir-apparent, by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Once, in
<div n="lb"/>the council of the king, Droṇa called Arjuna to him and
<div n="lb"/>said: “Oh, Arjuna! you must take an oath to do a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular thing in the presence of your relatives. If it happens
<div n="lb"/>that I oppose you in battle you should fight against me
<div n="lb"/>without thinking that I am your teacher. This oath is
<div n="lb"/>your gift to your teacher.” Arjuna agreed and took the
<div n="lb"/>oath in the presence of the people. Because there was such
<div n="lb"/>an oath Arjuna's conscience did not prick him when he
<div n="lb"/>had to fight against his teacher Droṇa in the battle of
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 139).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Part played by Droṇa up to the battle of Bhārata.%}
<div n="lb"/>(1) Duryodhana and his party came to know only at
<div n="lb"/>the time of the svayaṃvara (marriage) of Pāñcālī that
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas were not killed in the lac house burning.
<div n="lb"/>When Arjuna won the test and got Pāñcālī, the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas became furious and began to plot against the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. At that time Droṇa came to the council-hall
<div n="lb"/>of the Kauravas and said that the Kauravas should go
<div n="lb"/>to Pāñcāla and greet the Pāṇḍavas, bring them back
<div n="lb"/>and give them half of the kingdom. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 203).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Droṇa was present at the sacrifice of Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>(imperial consecration) performed by Yudhiṣṭhira.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 34, Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(3) When the game of dice was going on between
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni and Yudhiṣṭhira Droṇa came with Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>to the place to witness the game. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 60, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Droṇa declared that the game of dice between
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni and Yudhiṣṭhira was not fair (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Droṇa was well-versed in archery. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 37, Stanza 4).
<div n="NI"/>(6) While the Pāṇḍavas were living in the country of
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa, Arjuna in the guise of Bṛhannala, fought with the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas. Droṇa was the first to recognize Bṛhannala
<div n="lb"/>as Arjuna at the sound of his conch. (M.B. Virāṭa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 24).
<div n="NI"/>(7) In that fight Droṇa fought with Arjuna whose
<div n="lb"/>arrows wounded Droṇa and he ran away from the
<div n="lb"/>battlefield. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>(8) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to the council-hall of the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas to plead for a treaty on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>who had returned after forest life and pseudonymity,
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa took the side of the Pāṇḍavas and argued with
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 126).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Droṇa advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to see that a battle
<div n="lb"/>between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas was avoided.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, two Chapters from 138).
<div n="NI"/>(10) When it was almost decided that the battle was
<div n="lb"/>inevitable Droṇa boasted to Duryodhana that he would
[Page250-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>annihilate the army of the Pāṇḍavas within a month.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 193, Stanza 18).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Why Droṇa whose leaning was towards the Pāṇḍavas,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṭook the side of the Kauravas in the battle of Bhārata.%} At
<div n="lb"/>heart Droṇa was on the side of the Pāṇḍavas. But he
<div n="lb"/>fought against them, taking the side of the Kauravas.
<div n="lb"/>Even at that time he ardently wished the Pāṇḍavas to
<div n="lb"/>win the battle. What is the reason for it? An answer to
<div n="lb"/>this question is found in Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 43.
<div n="NI"/>The battle was about to begin. Dharmaputra went to
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa and bowed before him and requested to bless
<div n="lb"/>him so that he might win the battle against the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas. Droṇa said, “It is good on your part to have
<div n="lb"/>come and seen me before the battle is begun. If you
<div n="lb"/>had not seen me I would have cursed you to lose the
<div n="lb"/>battle. But today I am honoured since you have come.
<div n="lb"/>You fight the battle. Victory is yours. But I have to
<div n="lb"/>stand with the Kauravas, and there is a reason for it.
<div n="lb"/>Man is a slave of money and money is not the slave
<div n="lb"/>of Man. The Kauravas have tied me with money. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa will be on the side of the righteous. Where Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa is, there will be victory. But so long as I fight
<div n="lb"/>it is difficult for you to win. So try to kill me at the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of the battle. You need not feel sorry for
<div n="lb"/>killing your teacher. Because when I shower arrows
<div n="lb"/>and fight vehemently I won't look to see which enemy
<div n="lb"/>has struck me down. Enemies could kill me only when
<div n="lb"/>I am lying on darbha grass leaving fighting in dis-
<div n="lb"/>appointment. I will put down my weapons in battle
<div n="lb"/>only when I hear words which I dislike to hear.”
<div n="NI"/>After having revealed these secrets of his own he sent
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira back. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 43).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Droṇa in the battle of Bhārata.%} (1) On the first day
<div n="lb"/>of the battle Droṇa fought in a combat with Dhṛṣṭa-
