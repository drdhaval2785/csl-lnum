VAIKUṆṬHA III¦. A Brahmin saint who lived in the
<div n="lb"/>Tretāyuga. The living things got deliverance from sin,
<div n="lb"/>the moment they came into contact with him. This
<div n="lb"/>power of Vaikuṇṭha to give living things deliverance,
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned in Padma Purāṇa, Brahma khaṇḍa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 3, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Vaikuṇṭha once lighted a ghee-lamp in the presence of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu in Kārttika and returned home. At that time
<div n="lb"/>a rat came there and began to drink the ghee. Then
<div n="lb"/>the lamp blazed into a flame. The rat was terrified
<div n="lb"/>at this, and ran away. But by the grace of Viṣṇu the
<div n="lb"/>rat got deliverance from all its sins.
<div n="NI"/>That rat was killed by snake-bite. The men of Yama
<div n="lb"/>came with ropes. Instantly the messengers of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>also came on Garuḍa. Yama's men got afraid of
[Page819-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu's messengers and humbly asked them: “For
<div n="lb"/>what goodness of him are you taking this great sinner
<div n="lb"/>to Vaikuṇṭha?” They replied: “He had blazed a lamp
<div n="lb"/>before the presence of Viṣṇu. That act has earned for
<div n="lb"/>him a place in Vaikuṇṭha. The goodness earned by
<div n="lb"/>lighting a lamp with devotion and love in Kārttika,
<div n="lb"/>could be described only by Mukunda.” After that the
<div n="lb"/>rat was taken to Vaikuṇṭha.
