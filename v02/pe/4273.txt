MĀNASA IV¦. (MĀNASASARAS). A lake on the peak of
<div n="lb"/>the Himālayas. Arjuna visited this lake once. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>4, Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva). In the precincts of this
<div n="lb"/>lake many devotees conduct Śiva-worship. They believe
<div n="lb"/>they would merge with Śiva at the end of the yuga.
<div n="lb"/>Those who bathe in that pond would acquire mokṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Mānasasaras is called Ujjānaka also. Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatī became realised souls at this place. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>14, Chapter 130, Vana Parva). A sage who lived in
<div n="lb"/>Mānasasaras in the form of a swan visited Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>while he was lying on his bed of arrows. (Śloka 98,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 119, Bhīṣma Parva). Once a Devī named
<div n="lb"/>Upaśruti pointed out Indra who was hiding amongst
<div n="lb"/>the lotus stems in Mānasasaras. It was Brahmā who
<div n="lb"/>made this lotus lake and the river Sarayū starts from
<div n="lb"/>here. (Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
