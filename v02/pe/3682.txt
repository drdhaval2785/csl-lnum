KṚTADYUTI¦. Queen of King Citraketu. Though the
<div n="lb"/>King had many wives he had no children. He pleased
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras by means of his austerities and due to the latter's
<div n="lb"/>blessing Kṛtadyuti delivered a son. But, her co-wives
<div n="lb"/>poisoned the child to death at which both Citraketu
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛtadyuti fell down unconscious. Though Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>and Nārada appeared on the scene and tried their best
<div n="lb"/>to console the King and the queen they refused to be
<div n="lb"/>comforted. Then Aṅgiras returned to them the soul of
<div n="lb"/>the dead child. The soul saluted them and spoke as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—“Oh elders, during various births I had been
<div n="lb"/>the son of various parents. And, you please point out
<div n="lb"/>to me the particular parent as whose son I am to live
<div n="lb"/>just now.” Nobody had any answer to this question,
<div n="lb"/>and the child went on its own way.
<div n="NI"/>Afterwards Citraketu and Kṛtadyuti went round the
<div n="lb"/>earth as great devotees of the Almighty, and during
<div n="lb"/>this perambulation Citraketu came to the presence of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva on whose thigh Pārvatī was sitting then. Citraketu
[Page430-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>felt ashamed at the sight and questioned Pārvatī about
<div n="lb"/>her action whereupon she cursed and turned Citraketu
<div n="lb"/>into an Asura. The well known Vṛtrāsura was Citra-
<div n="lb"/>ketu thus reborn. Kṛtadyuti ended her life following the
<div n="lb"/>curse upon her husband. (Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
