MARAṆA¦ (M) (DEATH). Death is a goddess whose
<div n="lb"/>name is Mṛtyu. The Purāṇas state that there was no
<div n="lb"/>death in the world before the birth of this goddess. In
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Droṇa Parva, Chapter 53 there is the
<div n="lb"/>following story about the circumstances in which
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā created Mṛtyu.
<div n="NI"/>Living beings multiplied endlessly on earth. As they
<div n="lb"/>had no death, the goddess Earth found their weight too
<div n="lb"/>much for her to bear. She went weeping to Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>prayed for his help. At that time, Rudra and Nārada
<div n="lb"/>were present in Brahmā's assembly. Brahmā said that
<div n="lb"/>he did not like destroying living beings. Because of
<div n="lb"/>the pressure of Rudra and Nārada, Brahmā created out
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvaprakāsa (Cosmic Light) a woman. She
<div n="lb"/>was born from the south and Brahmā gave her the
[Page486-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>name “Mṛtyu”. He gave her permission to destroy
<div n="lb"/>human beings.
<div n="NI"/>When she heard that she was to kill living beings, she shed
<div n="lb"/>tears and Brahmā gathered those tears. She went to
<div n="lb"/>Dhenukāśrama and other places and performed tapas. At
<div n="lb"/>last Brahmā called her back and assured her that it was
<div n="lb"/>not against Dharma to kill living beings. He changed
<div n="lb"/>the tears he had gathered from her face into the various
<div n="lb"/>diseases and returned them to her. He gave those dis-
<div n="lb"/>eases and the god Yama as her companions. Thus the
<div n="lb"/>goddess Mṛtyu started her dance of destruction. (See
<div n="lb"/>also under the word PUNARJANMA).
