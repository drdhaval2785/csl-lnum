DHṚTARĀṢṬRA¦. I. Father of the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See the genealogy of Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śantanu, a king of the Lunar dynasty, had
<div n="lb"/>two wives Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Gāṅgā, gave birth to
<div n="lb"/>eight sons. But seven of them were thrown into the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā. Giving the eighth son Bhīṣma to Śantanu
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā disappeared. Śantanu then married Satyavatī,
<div n="lb"/>a fisher-woman. Satyavatī gave birth to two sons, Cit-
<div n="lb"/>rāṅgada and Vicitravīrya. When Śantanu grew old,
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada was anointed as King, as Bhīṣma had taken
<div n="lb"/>Brahmavrata (vow of celibacy). Once when Citrāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>gada went to the forest for hunting, a Gandharva of the
<div n="lb"/>name Citrāṅgada killed him. So Vicitravīrya became
<div n="lb"/>the King of Hastināpura. Bhīṣma took the three daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ters of the King of Kāśi, Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā
[Page236-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>by force into his chariot and brought the last two, to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura to be given as wives to Vicitravīrya. On
<div n="lb"/>the way he sent Ambā back. Vicitravīrya married Am-
<div n="lb"/>bikā and Ambālikā. But shortly after that he also died,
<div n="lb"/>before any children were born to him. Fearing that the
<div n="lb"/>Lunar dynasty would come to an end, Satyavatī brought
<div n="lb"/>her son Vedavyāsa, who was born to her from hermit
<div n="lb"/>Parāśara, before her marriage, to Hastināpura. In the
<div n="lb"/>night Satyavatī sent Ambikā adorned with ornaments
<div n="lb"/>and costly garments, to the bedroom of Vyāsa. But she
<div n="lb"/>could not bear to lie with Vyāsa who was clad in barks
<div n="lb"/>of the tree and wearing matted hair. Still thinking that
<div n="lb"/>it was not right on her part to stand against the wish of
<div n="lb"/>her mother, she approached Vyāsa and lay with him
<div n="lb"/>with closed eyes. Ambikā became pregnant. The child
<div n="lb"/>she gave birth to, was blind. That child was Dhṛtarāṣṭṛa.
<div n="lb"/>Next night Ambālikā approached Vyāsa. When she
<div n="lb"/>saw Vyāsa she turned pale at his uncouth figure and
<div n="lb"/>her face became bloodless. So the child born to her was
<div n="lb"/>pale and was called Pāṇḍu. Next night the maid of the
<div n="lb"/>queen approached Vyāsa with a joyful heart and so she
<div n="lb"/>got Vidura as son, who was extremely wise and intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gent. Thus Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura became sons
<div n="lb"/>of the same father.
<F>1. It is stated in M.B. Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 7 that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born as the incarnation of a Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>having the name Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (See under Dhṛtarāṣṭra III).</F> (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters, 63
<div n="lb"/>and 105).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Up to marriage.%} After the birth of Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>returned to forest and since then Bhīṣma stood in place
<div n="lb"/>of father to the children. Bhīṣma performed ‘Upanay-
<div n="lb"/>ana’ (investiture with Brahma-string) and other rites
<div n="lb"/>of the children. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura had
<div n="lb"/>their education in Hastināpura. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 108).
<Poem>“Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and the wise Vidura
<div n="lb"/>The three were brought up as sons by Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb"/>They became well educated, cultured and devotional,
<div n="lb"/>Respectful towards vows and fasts, and
<div n="lb"/>of good physique earnest in work
<div n="lb"/>And they became valiant youths.
<div n="lb"/>Learned the Vedas and Veda of archery,
<div n="lb"/>Clubbing, shield and swords play,
<div n="lb"/>Elephant-keeping, laws of chastisement,
<div n="lb"/>Veda śāstras, allied works and epics and the Purāṇas,
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu came out expert archer,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra the strongest of all.
<div n="lb"/>None in the three worlds was equal to Vidura,
<div n="lb"/>In wisdom and knowledge and righteousness.”
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 109).</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Because of his blindness Dhṛtarāṣṭra was not anointed
<div n="lb"/>as King. It is stated in M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 108
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 25, that in the place of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu was
<div n="lb"/>anointed the King.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage and birth of children.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra came of
<div n="lb"/>marriageable age. Bhīṣma had heard about Gāndhārī,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Subala, the King of Gāndhāra, as a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful damsel of good qualities. Moreover she had acquired
<div n="lb"/>a boon from Śiva that hundred sons would be born to
<div n="lb"/>her. Bhīṣma sent a messenger to Subala with a request
<div n="lb"/>to give Gāndhārī as wife to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Subala was
<div n="lb"/>not much pleased at the aspect of getting a blind man
<div n="lb"/>as son-in-law. Still he thought of the prestige his family
<div n="lb"/>would get by a marriage alliance with the kings of the
<div n="lb"/>Pūru Dynasty, and finally agreed. Gāndhārī submitted
<div n="lb"/>to the will of her father, and to live with a husband who
[Page236-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>was blind. She tied her eyes with a cloth. Śakuni the
<div n="lb"/>son of Subala brought Gāndhārī to Hastināpura, and
<div n="lb"/>gave her to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. With the sanction of Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>their marriage took place.
<div n="NI"/>Once Gāndhārī feasted Vyāsa who came tired with hun-
<div n="lb"/>ger and thirst. The hermit was pleased with her and
<div n="lb"/>blessed her to have hundred sons. Gāndhārī became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant. But even after two years no delivery took place.
<div n="lb"/>She crushed her womb by force and a lump of flesh
<div n="lb"/>came out. At that time Vyāsa came there. He cut the
<div n="lb"/>lump into hundred pieces and kept them in ghee-pots.
<div n="lb"/>Gandhārī had a desire to get a daughter also. Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>who had known it had cut the lump in such a way that
<div n="lb"/>there was a small piece in excess. The pots broke by
<div n="lb"/>themselves in due course and hundred sons and a
<div n="lb"/>daughter were born. The daughter was named Duśśalā.
<div n="lb"/>A son named Yuyutsu also was born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra of a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya woman. Duryodhana was the eldest of the
<div n="lb"/>hundred sons. The children grew up. Duśśalā was
<div n="lb"/>given in marriage to Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 109 to 116).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Till Bhārata-battle.%} At this juncture Pāṇḍu incurred
<div n="lb"/>a curse from a hermit that he would die if his wife tou-
<div n="lb"/>ched him. With that Pāṇḍu retired to forest with his
<div n="lb"/>wives. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was grieved at the separation of
<div n="lb"/>his brother. Pāṇḍu died in the forest and Mādrī jumped
<div n="lb"/>into fire and died with her husband. Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
<div n="lb"/>Vidura to perform their cremation rites. After that
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira became King. The Pāṇḍavas became more
<div n="lb"/>and more prosperous. This made the heart of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>cloudy. He gave sanction to Duryodhana to transfer the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas to the lac house in Vāraṇāvata. The lac house
<div n="lb"/>caught fire and it was rumoured that the Pāṇḍavas died
<div n="lb"/>in the lac house fire, and Dhṛtarāṣṭra shed crocodile
<div n="lb"/>tears, and ordered for the mourning and oblation to
<div n="lb"/>be performed. After the marriage of Pāñcālī, it came to
<div n="lb"/>be known that the Pāṇḍavas were alive and that they
<div n="lb"/>were living with Drupada. Dhṛtarāṣṭra recalled them and
<div n="lb"/>gave them half of the country. The Pāṇḍavas made
<div n="lb"/>Indraprastha their capital and began to rule the king-
<div n="lb"/>dom. Yudhiṣṭhira performed the sacrifice of Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>(royal consecration). Dhṛtarāṣṭra also took part in the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana wanted to challenge Yudhiṣṭhira to a
<div n="lb"/>game of dice. Dhṛtarāṣṭra agreed but advised Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana not to live in enmity with the Pāṇḍavas. The
<div n="lb"/>game of dice was played, and Yudhiṣṭhira lost every-
<div n="lb"/>thing the Pāṇḍavas had. Dhṛtarāṣṭra called Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>and told her that she might ask any boon. She request-
<div n="lb"/>ed that her husband Dharmaputra might be exempt-
<div n="lb"/>ed from servitude and the Pāṇḍavas made free. Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra compelled her to ask for more boons. She replied
<div n="lb"/>that according to law Vaiśyas were eligible for one boon,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya women two boons, Kings three boons and
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas hundred boons, and since she had already
<div n="lb"/>taken two boons, she wanted no more. Dhṛtarāṣṭra who
<div n="lb"/>was pleased at this reply gave the Pāṇḍavas freedom
<div n="lb"/>and returned all their lost wealth.
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana wanted to challenge the Pāṇḍavas for a
<div n="lb"/>game of dice again. Dhṛtarāṣṭra agreed. This time also
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira lost the game. The Pāṇḍavas who had lost
<div n="lb"/>everything, were ordered to go to forest for twelve years
<div n="lb"/>and to live incognito for one year. The Pāṇḍavas went
[Page237-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to the forest with Pāñcālī. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was grieved.
<div n="NI"/>After thirteen years the Pāṇḍavas returned. Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana said that not an inch of land would be given to
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt sorry at this Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>came to talk about conciliation. Duryodhana wanted to
<div n="lb"/>take him a prisoner. But Dhṛtarāṣṭra opposed it. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa showed Dhṛtarāṣṭra his Viśvarūpa (cosmic form)
<div n="lb"/>to see which, Kṛṣṇa gave him sight for the time being
<div n="lb"/>for which Dhṛtarāṣṭra was very thankful. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kauravas came to Kurukṣetra for Bhārata-battle.
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra called Sañjaya to him and asked him about
<div n="lb"/>the preparations the parties had made for war. Sañjaya
<div n="lb"/>gave a true description of the battle arrays of both
<div n="lb"/>parties. (M.B. Ādi Parva. Sabhā Parva, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>and Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the battle of Bhārata.%} The terrible
<div n="lb"/>battle began. The heart of Dhṛtarāṣṭra was grieved with
<div n="lb"/>sorrow. When Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>dratha, Dhṛtarāṣṭra cried aloud. When he knew that
<div n="lb"/>Śātyaki had destroyed the army of the Kauravas he
<div n="lb"/>became dumb with grief. He praised Bhīma's valour
<div n="lb"/>and blamed his sons. When Sañjaya told him
<div n="lb"/>about the fall of Karṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell down
<div n="lb"/>unconscious. He rose up again and attended to the
<div n="lb"/>noises from the battlefield. He fell down again when
<div n="lb"/>he knew that Śalya and Duryodhana were killed. He
<div n="lb"/>rose again and cried for a long time. He gathered the
<div n="lb"/>women-folk, his people and went to the battlefield.
<div n="lb"/>He broke the metal statue of Bhīma and embraced the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. He asked Yudhiṣṭhira to do the mourning
<div n="lb"/>and offerings for the dead. It was done accordingly.
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas respected Dhṛtarāṣṭra. But Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>scolded them. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī were greatly
<div n="lb"/>depressed and asked Yudhiṣṭhira to permit them to live
<div n="lb"/>in forest. Yudhiṣṭhira tried to prevent it. He kissed on
<div n="lb"/>the head of Yudhiṣṭhira. Seeing that they did not eat
<div n="lb"/>food he asked them to eat. Yudhiṣṭhira saw that they
<div n="lb"/>would eat only if he permitted them to live in forest.
<div n="lb"/>At last Yudhiṣṭhira agreed. Dhṛtarāṣṭra accepted
<div n="lb"/>money from Dharmaputra and performed mourning
<div n="lb"/>and offerings for the dead on a large scale (M.B. Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Karṇa Parva, Strī Parva, Śānti Parva and
<div n="lb"/>Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Journey to forest and death.%} Afterwards Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>and Gāndharī went to forest. Kunti followed them.
<div n="lb"/>All the subjects followed them a long way, crying.
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent them back and entrusted the teacher
<div n="lb"/>Kṛpa and Yuyutsu with the Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī and Kuntī lived on the Ganges. From there
<div n="lb"/>they came to Kurukṣetra and lived in the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Śatayūpā for a time. During that period Nārada
<div n="lb"/>visited them. The Pāṇḍavas and the subjects visited
<div n="lb"/>them again. Vyāsa also came there. He took Dhṛtarā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭra and the rest of them to the river Ganges and
<div n="lb"/>evoked the spirits of those who died in the battle.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra divine eye to see the departed
<div n="lb"/>spirits. After this, at the request of Vyāsa they all
<div n="lb"/>returned. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī went to
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādvāra and performed severe penance and were
<div n="lb"/>burnt to death in a wild fire. The relatives put their
<div n="lb"/>remains in the Ganges. The spirits of the three—Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī entered the realm of
<div n="lb"/>Kubera. (M.B. Āśramavāsika Parva, Svargārohaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
