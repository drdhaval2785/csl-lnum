VIŚVAVEDĪ¦. A minister of King Śauri. This minister
<div n="lb"/>wanted the King to be just. Śauri and his four brothers
<div n="lb"/>Khanitra, Udāvasu, Sunaya and Mahāratha were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Prajāpati. The main ruler of the kingdom was
<div n="lb"/>Khanitra. The others were Governors of the East, West
<div n="lb"/>North and South divisions of the kingdom. The four
<div n="lb"/>brothers had a priest each named Suhotra, Kuśāvarta,
<div n="lb"/>Pramati and Vasiṣṭha respectively.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvavedī gathered these four priests together and
<div n="lb"/>created four wicked fairies and sent them against
<div n="lb"/>Khanitra the King. The fierce fairies attacked Khanitra.
<div n="lb"/>But because of his purity and cleanliness the fairies
<div n="lb"/>had to admit defeat. The fairies came back and
<div n="lb"/>attacked their creators, the four priests and Viśvavedī
<div n="lb"/>who had planned the programme, and killed all the five
<div n="lb"/>of them. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Chapter 314).
