JĀMBAVĀN¦. A monkey of extraordinary might. He
<div n="lb"/>was the minister of Sugrīva.
<F>1) It is difficult to ascertain whether Jāmbavān was a monkey or a bear. In some of the Indian languages he is described as a
<div n="lb"/>monkey. In Malayālaṃ he was thought of as a monkey from ancient period. In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, which is the original work, Jāmba-
<div n="lb"/>vān is denoted by the words ‘Kapi’ (monkey) and Rkṣa (bear). Jāmbavān is called Ṛkṣapuṅgava in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa Bālakāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 17. From this it is to be assumed that Jāmbavān was a bear. In the same chapter it occurs that, it was the aim of Brahmā to
<div n="lb"/>make the gods and the celestial women take birth as monkeys to help Mahāviṣṇu in the incarnation of Śrī Rāma. So it is not
<div n="lb"/>wrong to consider Jāmbavān either as a bear or as a monkey.</F>
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} When the troubles and hardships caused by
<div n="lb"/>the wickedness of Rāvaṇa became unbearable the
<div n="lb"/>goddess Earth and the Devas approached Brahmā for
<div n="lb"/>redress. Brahmā took them to the sea of Milk. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>visṇu heard everything and said that he would incarnate
<div n="lb"/>as the son of Daśaratha and would kill Rāvaṇa. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>was directed to create monkeys to help him on that
<div n="lb"/>occasion. Accordingly Brahmā created Jāmbavān and
<div n="lb"/>several other monkeys.
[Page341-b+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>There are two stories about the birth of Jāmbavān in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Brahmā sat for a long time thinking about the
<div n="lb"/>creation of monkeys. Then he wanted to yawn., for
<div n="lb"/>which he opened the mouth and instantly Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>came out from inside Brahmā through the open mouth.
<div n="lb"/>“I have already created Jāmbayān the noble bear, who
<div n="lb"/>jumped out of my mouth when I yawned.” (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 17, Stanza 6).
<div n="NI"/>(2) One day time of Brahmā ended and the night had
<div n="lb"/>advanced two yāmas (six hours). The Madhukaiṭabhas
<div n="lb"/>born of the ear-wax of Mahāviṣṇu began to create
<div n="lb"/>trouble and commotion in the waters of the great flood.
<div n="lb"/>They saw a lotus on the surface of water. Seeing Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>in it they challenged him for fight. Hearing their shout-
<div n="lb"/>ing and the challenge Brahmā became afraid of the
<div n="lb"/>asuras. His middle face began to sweat. The sweat
<div n="lb"/>flowed through his cheeks and reached the loins. Jāmba-
<div n="lb"/>vān came into being from that sweat. So he got the
<div n="lb"/>name Ambujāta, (born from the water of sweat). As
<div n="lb"/>he was the first person who entered the country of
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbūnada he was called Jāmbavān. As he was born
<div n="lb"/>when there was no universe or time his age or date
<div n="lb"/>of birth could not be ascertained. At the time of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma Jāmbavān was six Manvantaras (age of a Manu)
<div n="lb"/>and for hundred and sixtyfour Caturyugas (a period of
<div n="lb"/>four yugas) old. (The present age is the twenty-eighth
<div n="lb"/>Caturyuga of the seventh Manu). Jāmbavān had wit-
<div n="lb"/>nessed all the incarnations from Matsya to Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa Pūrva Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jāmbavān and the incarnation of Śrī Rāma.%} During the
<div n="lb"/>time of Śrī Rāma Jāmbavān was the minister of
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva. It is stated in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Sarga 41, that Nīla, the son of Agni, Hanūmān,
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbavān, Suhotra, Sarāri, Śaragulma, Gaja, Gavākṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Gavaya, Suṣeṇa, Ṛṣabha, Mainda, Dvivida, Vijaya,
<div n="lb"/>Gandhamādana, Ulkāmukha, Asaṅga, Aṅgada and
<div n="lb"/>others were the ministers of Sugrīva.
<div n="NI"/>The monkeys who went to the south in search of Sītā,
<div n="lb"/>reached the sea shore. The question was how to jump
<div n="lb"/>over the sea to Laṅkā. Each of them came forward to
<div n="lb"/>show his ability and admitted failure. Finally Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>called Hanūmān to him and advised him to jump over
<div n="lb"/>to Laṅkā. Hanūmān who was not aware of his own
<div n="lb"/>powers,
<F>2) For the cause of his forgetting his own powers see under Trṇabindu II.</F> refused. Jāmbavān told him about his birth,
<div n="lb"/>self-power, attainment of boons etc. Hanūmān became
<div n="lb"/>convinced of his powers at the words of Jāmbavān and
<div n="lb"/>jumped over the sea to Laṅkā. (Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jāmbavān and the incarnation of Vāmana.%} Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>walked round Mahāviṣṇu, who incarnated as Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>to curb the powers of Mahābali. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbavān was immensely strong. But by the time of
<div n="lb"/>the incarnation of Śrī Rāma his strength had decreased
<div n="lb"/>much. Hear what he said to the monkeys who as-
<div n="lb"/>sembled on the sea shore to go in search of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>“My abilities in olden times were not what you see
<div n="lb"/>now. In the far old days, I had walked round that
[Page342-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Eternal Being Viṣṇu when he measured three steps at
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice of Mahābali. Now, I am very old and
<div n="lb"/>have not enough strength to jump over the sea.”
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā kāṇḍa, Sarga 65).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Jāmbavān and the incarnation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} The long-
<div n="lb"/>living Jāmbavān who had witnessed nine out of the
<div n="lb"/>ten incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu is seen in connection
<div n="lb"/>with the precious stone Syamantaka, in the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇa. The Sun-god gave this jewel Syamantaka to
<div n="lb"/>King Satrājit. His younger brother Prasena wore it
<div n="lb"/>and went to the forest for hunting. A lion killed him
<div n="lb"/>and took the jewel in his mouth and was going along
<div n="lb"/>the forest when Jāmbavān killed it and took the jewel.
<div n="lb"/>It was rumoured that Srī Kṛṣṇa had killed Prasena
<div n="lb"/>and taken the jewel. So Śrī Kṛṣṇa went in search of
<div n="lb"/>the jewel to the forest, defeated Jāmbavān and took the
<div n="lb"/>jewel, and returned it to Satrājit. Śrī Kṛṣṇa married
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbavatī the daughter of Jāmbavān. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Jāmbavān became old for ever.%} At the time of the
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Vāmana, Jāmbavān was very strong
<div n="lb"/>and valiant. When Vāmana brought under control the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds by measuring three steps Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>travelled throughout the three worlds carrying the news
<div n="lb"/>everywhere. Within three moments Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>travelled eighteen times through the three worlds. In
<div n="lb"/>this travel of lightning-speed the end of the nail of his
<div n="lb"/>toe touched the highest peak of Mahāmeru, who
<div n="lb"/>considered it as an insult and said “You are arrogant
<div n="lb"/>of your speed and youth. Hereafter your body will
<div n="lb"/>not reach where your mind reaches and you shall be
<div n="lb"/>ever old.” Because of this curse Jāmbavān became old
<div n="lb"/>and unable to carry out what he wished. (Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
