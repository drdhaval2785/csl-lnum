KEKARALOHITA¦. A great serpent which once took
<div n="lb"/>sage Cyavana to Pātāla. Cyavana, after worshipping
<div n="lb"/>Śiva at Nakuleśvara tīrtha got into river Narmadā to
<div n="lb"/>take his bath when the nāga called Kekaralohita
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of him, dragged him and bit him. As
<div n="lb"/>the sage meditated upon Viṣṇu the poison did not
<div n="lb"/>affect him. The serpent released him from Pātāla as
<div n="lb"/>he was unaffected by poison. Cyavana went to the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Prahlāda accompanied by nāga damsels. On
<div n="lb"/>the request of Prahlāda Cyavana described to him the
<div n="lb"/>holy places on earth, and without any delay Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>came to earth for hunting during which sojourn on
<div n="lb"/>earth he visited Naimiṣāraṇya. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 8).
