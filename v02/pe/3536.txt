KĪKAṬA¦ (M). The country ruled by King Kīkaṭa.
<div n="lb"/>The following story is told in Devī Bhāgavata as to how
<div n="lb"/>an ass in this kingdom attained heaven.
<div n="NI"/>There was once in Kīkaṭa a merchant who had an ass
<div n="lb"/>to carry his merchandise. Once the merchant was
[Page411-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>returning home from Bhadrācala with his ass loaded
<div n="lb"/>with bundles of costly Rudrākṣas. The old ass fell down
<div n="lb"/>dead on the way, the weight of the Rudrākṣa bundles
<div n="lb"/>having been too much for it, and immediately it
<div n="lb"/>assumed the form of Śiva and went to Kailāsa. Even
<div n="lb"/>if a man does not know what he is carrying, if he
<div n="lb"/>carries sacred things he will certainly attain salvation,
<div n="lb"/>like the ass that attained salvation in this case. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 11th Skandha).
