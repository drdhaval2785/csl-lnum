IRIMPU¦. A Malayalam word meaning ‘iron’. The
<div n="lb"/>metal iron originated in the following way. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>sought Brahmā's protection against the onslaughts of
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura, who had obtained a boon to the effect that
<div n="lb"/>he could be killed only by a son born to Śiva. And,
<div n="lb"/>implored by Brahmā and others Śiva entered into the
<div n="lb"/>sex act with Pārvatī. The impact shook the universe.
<div n="lb"/>Agni separated them from the process and the semen of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva dropped in Agni. Agni deposited it in the Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>The Gaṅgā could not bear it and it coursed through
<div n="lb"/>her (Gaṅgā's) arteries and out of it was born Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya. Also from the particles of the semen gold and
<div n="lb"/>silver were produced. From the intensity of the heat
<div n="lb"/>were produced iron and copper. See under Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Canto 37).
