KĀRANDHAMANA¦ (M). A tīrtha situated near the
<div n="lb"/>southern ocean. The five holy places in the southern
<div n="lb"/>ocean, viz. Agastya tīrtha, Saubhadra tīrtha, Pauloma
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha, Kārandhamana tīrtha and Bhāradvāja tīrtha were
<div n="lb"/>called Pañca tīrthas. In the course of Arjuna's
<div n="lb"/>pilgrimage, he visited these Pañca tīrthas. At that
<div n="lb"/>time, the Sages never used to go there. There was a
<div n="lb"/>special reason for it. The five celestial women, Vargā,
<div n="lb"/>Saurabheyī, Samīcī, Budbudā and Latā used to live in
<div n="lb"/>them in the form of crocodiles as a result of a sage's
<div n="lb"/>curse. Arjuna liberated all of them. (For details see
<div n="lb"/>under the word “Vargā”).
