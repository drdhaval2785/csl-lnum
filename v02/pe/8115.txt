VĀSUKI¦. One of the famous Nāgas (serpents).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The uragas and nāgas (serpents) were born
<div n="lb"/>to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Kadrū. Vāsuki, the
<div n="lb"/>eldest son of Kadrū spent his childhood with his
<div n="lb"/>parents.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Difference of opinion.%} Vinatā and Kadrū staked on
<div n="lb"/>the colour of the tail of Uccaiśśravas (A horse obtained
<div n="lb"/>at the churning of the sea of Milk. To win the stake,
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū asked her sons to hang on the tail of Uccaiśś-
<div n="lb"/>ravas as black hairs. But the truthful Vāsuki was not
<div n="lb"/>prepared to do so. Kadrū cursed Vāsuki and the others
<div n="lb"/>who sided with him. From that day onwards Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>and those who were cursed, separated from their mother
<div n="lb"/>and formed into a serpent group. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 37 and 48)
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The length of Vāsuki.%} The Devas and the asuras
<div n="lb"/>decided to get Amṛta (Ambrosia—the celestial honey of
<div n="lb"/>immortality) by churning the sea of milk. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>went to bring Mandara-mountain, to be used as the
<div n="lb"/>churning rod. Their attempt was futile. The asuras
<div n="lb"/>made a trial with the same result. The Bhūtagaṇas
<div n="lb"/>(Guards) of Śiva also made a vain attempt. On the
<div n="lb"/>instruction of Viṣṇu, Garuḍa went and brought the
<div n="lb"/>mountain as easily as an eagle takes away a frog. Now
<div n="lb"/>Vāsuki should be brought. The Devas and Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>failed in that attempt also. Garuḍa who was haughty
<div n="lb"/>of his strength and speed, went to the city of the nāgas
<div n="lb"/>(serpents) and requested Vāsuki to come to the sea of
<div n="lb"/>Milk. Vāsuki replied that if the matter was so urgent
<div n="lb"/>he had no objection for being carried to that place. He
<div n="lb"/>took the middle part of Vāsuki in his beak and flew up
<div n="lb"/>higher and higher and reached beyond the horizon.
<div n="lb"/>Still the lower half of Vāsuki was lying on the ground.
<div n="lb"/>So he took Vāsuki in his beak as folded in two. Still
<div n="lb"/>the result was the same. Garuḍa became aware of the
<div n="lb"/>impossibility of carrying Vāsuki and returned, ashamed
<div n="lb"/>and disappointed. Viṣṇu rebuked him for his arrogance.
<div n="lb"/>After this, Śiva stretched his hand to Pātāla. Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>became a small bangle on that hand. Thus Vāsuki was
<div n="lb"/>brought to the shore of the sea of Milk. (Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) For the safety and protection of the Nāgas (ser-

<div n="lb"/>hermit Jaratkāru. (See under Jaratkāru).

<div n="lb"/>Vāsuki acted as the bow-string of Śiva and as the axle
<div n="lb"/>of his chariot. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 34, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>22).

<div n="lb"/>ern Sea. (See under Trikūṭa).

<div n="lb"/>Pannaga, Pannagarāṭ, Sarparāja, and so on are used
<div n="lb"/>as synonyms of Vāsuki in Mahābhārata.
