KAUTSYA¦ (KAUTSA). A hermit who was the disciple
<div n="lb"/>of Varatantu. When he had completed his education
<div n="lb"/>he asked his teacher what gift he desired. The teacher
<div n="lb"/>said that he wanted fourteen crores of gold coins as
<div n="lb"/>gift. Kautsya approached the emperor Raghu. The
<div n="lb"/>emperor had just finished a sacrifice called Viśvajit and
<div n="lb"/>had emptied his treasury by giving away all the
<div n="lb"/>wealth he had as alms. Only pots made of wood were
<div n="lb"/>left as his wealth. When the emperor heard about the
<div n="lb"/>need of Kautsya he decided to conquer the capital city
<div n="lb"/>of Kubera. That night Kubera filled the treasury of
<div n="lb"/>Raghu by a shower of gold. The emperor Raghu gave
<div n="lb"/>Kautsya fourteen crores of gold coins. (Raghuvaṃśa).
