GĀLAVA¦. A celebrated sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He was a son of Viśvāmitra. He was a
<div n="lb"/>brahmavādī. (Śloka 52, Chapter 4, Anuśāsana Parva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got his name.%} There is no record of his origi-
<div n="lb"/>nal name in any of the Purāṇas. He got his name
<div n="lb"/>Gālava later. There is a story about this both in Devī-
<div n="lb"/>bhāgavata and Harivaṃśa. It is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>There was once a King called Aruṇa in the family of
<div n="lb"/>Māndhātā. Aruṇa got a son and he was named Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata. (It was this Satyavrata who later became the well
<div n="lb"/>famed Triśaṅku). When Satyavrata was a youngster
<div n="lb"/>he once went inside the marriage hall of a brahmin and
<div n="lb"/>kidnapped the bride. Furious at this evil deed of his
<div n="lb"/>son the king sent him out from his palace and Satyavrata
<div n="lb"/>roamed about aimlessly.
<div n="NI"/>Nature protested against this deed of the King abandon-
<div n="lb"/>ing his heir and there was no rain in the country for
<div n="lb"/>twelve years. The people were all put to great trouble.
<div n="lb"/>Among those who suffered were the wife and children
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvāmitra. Viśvāmitra had at that time gone to
<div n="lb"/>the shores of the river Kauśikī, for doing penance. The
<div n="lb"/>family of Viśvāmitra was in great distress living without
<div n="lb"/>any means for food. The sight of the children crying
<div n="lb"/>for food to appease their hunger pained their mother
<div n="lb"/>much. So she decided to sell one child and feed the
<div n="lb"/>others by what she got from the sale. It was better to
<div n="lb"/>be without one child than all the children dying out of
<div n="lb"/>hunger.
<div n="NI"/>She made a rope out of darbha leaves and tying it round
<div n="lb"/>the neck of one child took it to the market for sale.
<div n="lb"/>Both the mother and child were weeping profusely on
<div n="lb"/>their way. Satyavrata saw them and took pity on them.
<div n="lb"/>When Satyavrata heard their sad story and knew that
<div n="lb"/>the woman was the wife of Viśvāmitra he told her
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Oh, Venerable Lady, you need not sell this boy.
<div n="lb"/>Untie the rope round his neck and throw it away. I
<div n="lb"/>will look after your family till the return of your hus-
<div n="lb"/>band. I will daily bring food for you all and hang it
<div n="lb"/>on a tree near your āśrama.”
<div n="NI"/>The mother was extremely happy to hear this and she
<div n="lb"/>at once untied the rope round the neck of the boy and
<div n="lb"/>the boy from thence became known as Gālava. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see under Triśaṅku).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gurudakṣiṇā of Gālava.%} Gālava continued his educa-
<div n="lb"/>tion under his father. At that time Dharmadeva to
[Page272-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>test Viśvāmitra came to him disguised as Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra came out with rice to receive the guest but
<div n="lb"/>by that time the guest had disappeared. But Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra remained there with the rice for hundred years
<div n="lb"/>till Dharmadeva returned. All these years Gālava looked
<div n="lb"/>after Viśvāmitra's comforts. Viśvāmitra was immensely
<div n="lb"/>pleased with Gālava and allowed him to go away free
<div n="lb"/>without any gurudakṣiṇā when his education was over.
<div n="lb"/>Gālava wanted to give some dakṣiṇā but Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>refused to accept it. Gālava insisted on giving and then
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra asked him to give whatever he liked but
<div n="lb"/>Gālava wanted the Dakṣiṇā to be named. Disgusted
<div n="lb"/>with this stubbornness Viśvāmitra said “Go and get me
<div n="lb"/>eight hundred horses each with one of its ears black”.
<div n="lb"/>Gālava was shocked to hear the demand and greatly
<div n="lb"/>worried roamed about in search of horses of the type
<div n="lb"/>specified. Garuḍa taking pity on his sad plight took
<div n="lb"/>him to the palace of Yayāti. Hearing the story of
<div n="lb"/>Gālava Yayāti sent his daughter Mādhavī with Gālava
<div n="lb"/>saying that if she was given in marriage to any king he
<div n="lb"/>would give him the eight hundred horses of the type
<div n="lb"/>he required.
<div n="NI"/>Gālava took Mādhavī to Haryaśva, a King of the
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku line of Kings. Haryaśva was doing penance
<div n="lb"/>at that time to obtain a child. Gālava said that Har-
<div n="lb"/>yaśva would get a son of Mādhavī and he should,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, accept Mādhavī and give him in return eight
<div n="lb"/>hundred horses each with one ear black. Haryaśva was
<div n="lb"/>amenable to the terms but the only difficulty was that
<div n="lb"/>he had only two hundred horses of the type specified.
<div n="lb"/>Finding this difficulty Mādhavī said “Oh, Gālava
<div n="lb"/>please do not worry on that account. I have a boon from
<div n="lb"/>a brahmavādī sage that I would remain a maiden
<div n="lb"/>even after delivery. So give me in marriage to this
<div n="lb"/>King and get two hundred horses. After giving birth
<div n="lb"/>to a son to this King take me to another King and
<div n="lb"/>get two hundred horses from him and then to another and
<div n="lb"/>thus by giving me to four Kings you can get the eight
<div n="lb"/>hundred horses you require.”
<div n="NI"/>Gālava liked this plan and so when Mādhavī gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a son he took her to Divodāsa, Rājā of Kāśī.
<div n="lb"/>When a son was born to him Gālava took her to Uśīnara,
<div n="lb"/>King of Bhoja. Gālava thus got six hundred horses but
<div n="lb"/>there was nobody else to give him the remaining two
<div n="lb"/>hundred. When Gālava was contemplating as to what
<div n="lb"/>he should do next Garuḍa came to his rescue. He
<div n="lb"/>advised Gālava to give six hundred horses and Mādhavī
<div n="lb"/>in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses to Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra. Gālava gave Viśvāmitra the horses and Mādhavī
<div n="lb"/>and pleased with the gurudakṣiṇā Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>blessed Gālava. Viśvāmitra got a son named Aṣṭaka
<div n="lb"/>of Madhavī. (See under Aṣṭaka).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gālava and Citrasena.%} Gālava was once having his even-
<div n="lb"/>ing prayers in the river when the spittings from the mouth
<div n="lb"/>of Citrasena who was travelling by air above fell on
<div n="lb"/>the pūjā materials of Gālava. Gālava went and com-
<div n="lb"/>plained to Śrī Kṛṣṇa of this and Kṛṣṇa in haste pro-
<div n="lb"/>mised to bring before Gālava the head of Citrasena
<div n="lb"/>before the sun set. Nārada who heard this went and
<div n="lb"/>informed Citrasena of Kṛṣṇa's vow. Citrasena was
<div n="lb"/>frightened to death. But Nārada asked him not to lose
<div n="lb"/>hope and advised Sandhyā and Valī, wives of Citra-
<div n="lb"/>sena, to approach Subhadrā, sister of Kṛṣṇa, for pro-
<div n="lb"/>tection. Both of them went to Subhadrā and made a
[Page272-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>grand fire-pit in front of her palace. Citrasena decided
<div n="lb"/>to end his life by jumping into the fire and as he was
<div n="lb"/>circling the pit his wives wept loudly. Since her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band Arjuna was away from the palace Subhadrā her-
<div n="lb"/>self ran to the place from where she heard the cries.
<div n="lb"/>When they saw Subhadrā they begged for ‘Maṅgalya-
<div n="lb"/>bhikṣā’ (a boon to live with one's husband). Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>agreed to give them that. Then she heard their story
<div n="lb"/>in full and only then did she realise that she had under-
<div n="lb"/>taken to do the impossible. Yet, to help Subhadrā,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna agreed to protect Citrasena. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>attacked Citrasena Arjuna defended. The fight then
<div n="lb"/>ensued between Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. Both had very
<div n="lb"/>powerful and divine weapons and the world stood on
<div n="lb"/>the verge of a collapse by their fight. Then Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>did a brave thing. She stood between the two and
<div n="lb"/>requested for a cease-fire. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa asked Citra-
<div n="lb"/>sena to bow down and touch the feet of Gālava. Gālava
<div n="lb"/>pardoned him. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Tapodāna.%} Gālava once gave Yayāti one eighth
<div n="lb"/>portion of the goodness accrued to him by his long
<div n="lb"/>penance. (See Yayāti for details).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Gālava gets a horse.%} Pātālaketu, a demon, used to
<div n="lb"/>give trouble to Gālava daily while he used to do
<div n="lb"/>penance. Once this demon sent a deep hot breath to
<div n="lb"/>the sky and then a horse fell from the sky. Soon an
<div n="lb"/>unknown voice from air said, “This is a very strong
<div n="lb"/>horse and it would travel many a yojana in an hour.”
<div n="lb"/>Gālava took that horse and gave it to Ṛtadhvaja.
<div n="lb"/>(Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 59).
