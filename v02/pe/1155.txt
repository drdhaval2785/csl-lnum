<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and Boyhood.%} Bhīṣma's name in his boyhood was
<div n="lb"/>Devavrata. He was the eighth son of Śantanu, a king
<div n="lb"/>of the lunar dynasty and Gaṅgādevī. This boy was the
<div n="lb"/>human embodiment of Dyau, one of the Aṣṭavasus.
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu, his father was the re-birth of another king,
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhiṣeka. The story concerning this, as given in
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>King Mahābhiṣeka after his death, attained Viṣṇuloka.
<div n="lb"/>Once he went to visit Brahmā at Satyaloka. At that
<div n="lb"/>time Gaṅgādevī was also present in Brahmā's assembly.
<div n="lb"/>In that pious atmosphere, a gentle breeze began to blow
<div n="lb"/>and Gaṅgādevī's clothes were slightly deranged. Just
<div n="lb"/>at that moment, Mahābhiṣeka took a stealthy glance at
<div n="lb"/>her and she also returned that glance. This was noted
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmā who turned both of them into human beings
<div n="lb"/>by a curse. Gaṅgādevi begged pardon and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>lifted the curse and blessed her that the Aṣṭavasus would
<div n="lb"/>come to the earth to be born as her sons and that after-
<div n="lb"/>wards she could come back to Heaven. After that
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādevī was born as a mortal woman in the world
<div n="lb"/>under the name Gaṅgā and she spent her days in the
<div n="lb"/>forests near the Gaṅgā river valleys.
<div n="NI"/>In those days the ruler of the Lunar dynasty was a king
<div n="lb"/>named Pratīpa. Having no children, he went to the
<div n="lb"/>bank of the river Gaṅgā and performed tapas there.
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādevī who was moving about in the forests near-
<div n="lb"/>by, saw the King deeply absorbed in his tapas. She
<div n="lb"/>approached him and sat on his right thigh. She wanted
<div n="lb"/>the King to be her husband. He explained to her that
<div n="lb"/>the right thigh is the proper seat of a daughter-in-law
[Page135-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and so she would become his son's wife in due course.
<div n="lb"/>In course of time, Pratīpa had a son, Śantanu, born
<div n="lb"/>to him. When Śantanu grew up into a young man, one
<div n="lb"/>day he went for a hunt to the Gaṅgā-valley and there he
<div n="lb"/>met Gaṅgādevī. He fell in love with her at first sight
<div n="lb"/>and courted her. Gaṅgādevī agreed to become his wife
<div n="lb"/>on condition that he should not say anything to displease
<div n="lb"/>her and if he violated that condition she would leave him.
<div n="lb"/>The king accepted the condition and they became man
<div n="lb"/>and wife.
<div n="NI"/>At about that time, the wife of Dyo, one of the Aṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>vasus, happened to see the sacrificial cow of the sage
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and wished to have it. She expressed her
<div n="lb"/>desire to her husband, Dyo. Dyo, with the other seven
<div n="lb"/>vasus went and took away by force, Vasiṣṭha's cow.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha in his anger cursed the Aṣṭavasus to be born as
<div n="lb"/>mortals. They repented and begged pardon from
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. The sage told them that all of them would
<div n="lb"/>be born as the sons of Gaṅgādevī and all except Dyo,
<div n="lb"/>who actually stole the cow, would return to Heaven
<div n="lb"/>at the time of birth itself. As for Dyo, he would continue
<div n="lb"/>to live in the world for a long time, as an adventurous
<div n="lb"/>hero.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṅgādevī became pregnant and gave birth to her first
<div n="lb"/>child. She carried the child to the river Gaṅgā and
<div n="lb"/>threw it into the river. Śantanu who followed her up
<div n="lb"/>to the river bank, did not say anything against her,
<div n="lb"/>remembering his promise.
<div n="NI"/>Seven children were born to her and she threw all of them
<div n="lb"/>into the river in this way. When she gave birth to the
<div n="lb"/>eighth child, Śantanu insisted that he would not allow
<div n="lb"/>her to throw away that child into the river. As he had
<div n="lb"/>violated the condition, the angry Gaṅgādevī left the
<div n="lb"/>palace with her child. She named it Devavrata and
<div n="lb"/>brought him up in the forest. The sage Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādevī taught him all branches of knowledge.
<div n="lb"/>Thirtytwo years later, the king went to the same forest
<div n="lb"/>for hunting. He saw a handsome boy stopping the
<div n="lb"/>flow of the river Gaṅgā. Getting interested in the boy,
<div n="lb"/>the King approached him. But by that time he had
<div n="lb"/>disappeared. The King prayed to Gaṅgādevī to give
<div n="lb"/>back the child. She appeared with the child and after
<div n="lb"/>handing over the child to him vanished. The king
<div n="lb"/>returned to the palace with the child. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 95-100).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The name Bhīṣma.%} Devavrata was anointed, as
<div n="lb"/>heir-apparent. One day King Śantanu reached the
<div n="lb"/>forest near the Gaṅgā river valley, for hunting. As he
<div n="lb"/>was hunting, absorbed in the beauty of the forest scenery,
<div n="lb"/>he felt the perfume of musk filling the air in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>He wondered from where it could come. He went on
<div n="lb"/>and on trying to find out the source of this smell until
<div n="lb"/>he reached the cottage of a fisherman. The fisherman
<div n="lb"/>had a daughter named Satyavatī. It was from her that
<div n="lb"/>the fragrance of musk spread all around.
<F>1) Satyavatī's original name was Kālī. The fisherman got her from the stomach of a fish. (See the word Adrikā). Since she
<div n="lb"/>had the smell of fish she got the name of “Matsyagandhī.” She used to assist a fisherman in his work as a ferryman in the river Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>Once the sage Parāśara happened to get into her boat and he fell deeply in love with her. The sage removed the smell of fish from her and gave
<div n="lb"/>her the perfume of musk instead. By this mystic power he created a mist at noon and under its cover, he had a sexual union with her. As
<div n="lb"/>a result of it the child Kṛṣṇa (Vyāsa) was born. The child immediately left the mother to perform tapas in the forest after promising to
<div n="lb"/>return to her whenever she wished for his presence. Although she gave birth to a child, Parāśara blessed that she would again remain a
<div n="lb"/>virgin. The whole episode remained a secret. As usual, Satyavatī returned to the fisherman's cottage in the evening and continued to
<div n="lb"/>live with him. It is at this stage that Śantanu was attracted by the perfume of musk and came to the cottage where he met Satyavatī.</F> The king
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with her at first sight. He asked the fisherman
<div n="lb"/>to give the girl in marriage to him. But the brave fisher-
[Page135-b+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>man did not yield to the king's demand immediately.
<div n="lb"/>He laid down several conditions, one of which was that
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī's sons should succeed to the throne of Śantanu.
<div n="lb"/>The king was in a fix. Devavrata was the eldest son and
<div n="lb"/>heir-apparent. To deny kingship to his sons would be
<div n="lb"/>highly improper. Unable to find a solution to this diffi-
<div n="lb"/>cult problem, the king returned to the palace, much
<div n="lb"/>depressed and gloomy. There he avoided all company
<div n="lb"/>and took to his bed, passing his time in sadness and
<div n="lb"/>solitude.
<div n="NI"/>When Devavrata knew about his father's condition, he
<div n="lb"/>called the Ministers and asked them about it. They
<div n="lb"/>told him everything in details. At once, without inform-
<div n="lb"/>ing even his father, Devavrata went to the fisherman's
<div n="lb"/>cottage on the bank of the river Gaṅgā and begged for
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī on behalf of his father. The fisherman repeated
<div n="lb"/>his former condition. Devavrata agreed that Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī's son shall be given the right of Kingship. The
<div n="lb"/>fisherman pointed out that disputes were likely to arise
<div n="lb"/>between Devavrata's sons and Satyavatī's children regar-
<div n="lb"/>ding the right of succession to the throne. At once
<div n="lb"/>Devavrata stood up and made a solemn pledge that he
<div n="lb"/>would remain a bachelor for life. The fisherman gave
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī to Devavrata to be taken to the King. Deva-
<div n="lb"/>vrata took her to the palace and presented her to his
<div n="lb"/>father. The King, when he came to know of the part
<div n="lb"/>played by his son in the matter, rose from his bed and
<div n="lb"/>embraced Devavrata with tears of joy and gratitude.
<div n="lb"/>The gods showered flowers on the scene. Because he had
<div n="lb"/>taken such a solemn oath, it was declared that hence-
<div n="lb"/>forth he would be known by the name “BHĪṢMA”.
<div n="lb"/>The loving father Śantanu also gave him a boon that
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma would die only when he wished. (M.B., Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Affairs of the Kingdom in crisis.%} Two sons named
<div n="lb"/>Vicitravīrya and Citrāṅgada were born to Satyavatī by
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu, who died shortly afterwards. As desired by
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī, Bhīṣma crowned the boy Citrāṅgada as king.
<div n="lb"/>Although Citrāṅgada's reign was a prosperous one, it
<div n="lb"/>could not last long. Once a Gandharva named Citrāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>gada attacked him at Kurukṣetra and after a battle
<div n="lb"/>which lasted for three years, the Gandharva Citrāṅgada
<div n="lb"/>killed the King Citrāṅgada. It was Bhīṣma who per-
<div n="lb"/>formed the funeral rites of the King Citrāṅgada. After
<div n="lb"/>that Vicitravīrya was crowned King.
<div n="NI"/>It was at that time that the Svayaṃvara of the three
<div n="lb"/>daughters of the King of Kāśī, Aṃbā, Aṃbikā and
<div n="lb"/>Aṃbālikā, was held. Bhīṣma thought that it would be
<div n="lb"/>good if Vicitravīrya married them. So Bhīṣma attended
<div n="lb"/>that function. The presence of Bhīṣma who was an old
<div n="lb"/>man, at the Svayaṃvara, frightened the girls. The other
<div n="lb"/>kings who were present, stopped him from entering
<div n="lb"/>the place, since he had taken an oath to remain a life-
<div n="lb"/>long bachelor. The old Bhīṣma stood up and spoke at
<div n="lb"/>length about the eight different forms of marriage and
<div n="lb"/>after defeating several kings like Śālva, he seized the
<div n="lb"/>three daughters of the King of Kāśi and took them with
[Page136-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>him in his chariot to Hastināpura. Preparations were
<div n="lb"/>made for the marriage of Vicitravīrya with the three
<div n="lb"/>princesses. Then Ambā approached Bhīṣma and told
<div n="lb"/>him that she had already dedicated her heart to the king
<div n="lb"/>of Śālva. Bhīṣma generously allowed her to return home.
<div n="lb"/>(For the rest of Ambā's story, see the word “Ambā”.
<div n="NI"/>Vicitravīrya married Ambikā and Ambālikā. He ruled
<div n="lb"/>over the country for seven years at the end of which he
<div n="lb"/>died of consumption. The dynasty faced a crisis, as
<div n="lb"/>there was no one to succeed him. Satyavatī approached
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma with a suggestion to beget children by Vicitra-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya's wife. But Bhīṣma stood firmly on his solemn oath
<div n="lb"/>to continue as a life-long bachelor. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 100-104).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Bhīṣma's Wire Pulling.%} After that Satyavatī sum-
<div n="lb"/>moned Vyāsa to Hastināpura and sons were born
<div n="lb"/>to Ambikā, Ambālikā and their maid by him. Ambikā
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Ambālikā gave birth to
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu and the maid gave birth to Vidura. They grew
<div n="lb"/>up and Dhṛtarāṣṭra married Gāndhārī and Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>married Kuntī and Mādrī. Duryodhana and his brothers
<div n="lb"/>were born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, while the Pāṇḍavas were
<div n="lb"/>born to Pāṇḍu. Pāṇḍu died at the Śataśṛṅga vana and
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī observed satī by jumping into his funeral pyre
<div n="lb"/>and burning herself alive. After that, the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>and Pāṇḍavas who lived in the palace at Hastināpura,
<div n="lb"/>split up into two blocs. When the palace made of lac
<div n="lb"/>was destroyed by fire, the Pāṇḍavas went into the forest
<div n="lb"/>and came back to the country after their marriage with
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī. They ruled over the country with Indraprastha
<div n="lb"/>as their capital. In the gambling contest between
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra and Duryodhana, the Pāṇḍavas lost their
<div n="lb"/>kingdom and everything and so they went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>again. They lived for twelve years in the forest and spent
<div n="lb"/>one year incognito in the palace of the King of Virāṭa.
<div n="lb"/>At that time the Pāṇḍavas reappeared in the battle
<div n="lb"/>which took place as a result of the theft of King Virāṭa's
<div n="lb"/>cows by the Kauravas. Duryodhana asserted that he
<div n="lb"/>would not give so much land to the Pāṇḍavas as to put
<div n="lb"/>a dot with a needle. With the failure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>mediation, the Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas encamped on
<div n="lb"/>the opposite sides of the field of Kurukṣetra, preparing
<div n="lb"/>for a grim battle.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīṣma was the chief protagonist in all these events
<div n="lb"/>relating to the Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas. At every stage
<div n="lb"/>in the story we see Bhīṣma's influence. The main events
<div n="lb"/>in which this superman who used to give shelter to
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas alike, played a decisive role,
<div n="lb"/>are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) Bhīṣma sent a messenger to Subala, king of Gān-
<div n="lb"/>dhāra, to ask for the hand of Gāndhārī, to be married to
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 109, Verse
<div n="lb"/>11).
<div n="NI"/>(2) He went to the palace of Śalya, king of Madra and
<div n="lb"/>secured Mādrī to be married to Pāṇḍu. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 112).
<div n="NI"/>(3) He brought about the marriage between Vidura and
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Devaka. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>113, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(4) The Maharṣis who were the inhabitants of Śatasṛṅga
<div n="lb"/>told Bhīṣma about the birth of the Pāṇḍavas. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 125, Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Bhīṣma offered ‘Jalāñjali’ (worship with holy water)
<div n="lb"/>to Pāṇḍu at his death. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 126,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 27).
[Page136-b+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(6) He performed the death anniversary of Pāṇḍu.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 1).
<div n="NI"/>(7) He engaged Droṇācārya to teach archery to the
<div n="lb"/>princes. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 77).
<div n="NI"/>(8) He burst into tears and wept bitterly on hearing that
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were burnt to death in the palace of lac and
<div n="lb"/>was about to offer them ‘Jalāñjali’. Just then, Vidura
<div n="lb"/>came to him and secretly informed him that the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>were not dead. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 149, Dākṣi-
<div n="lb"/>ṇātya Pāṭha).
<div n="NI"/>(9) He advised Duryodhana to give half the kingdom to
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 202).
<div n="NI"/>(10) He had taken part in Dharmaputra's Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>Yajña. Dharmaputra had entrusted to Bhīṣma, the
<div n="lb"/>arrangements for that yajña. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 35, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(11) He advised Yudhiṣṭhira to give the highest place of
<div n="lb"/>honour in that yajña to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 36, Verse 28).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Bhīṣma ridiculed Śiśupāla (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>33).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Śiśupāla insulted Bhīṣma. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>41).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Bhīṣma stopped Bhīma who rushed out to kill
<div n="lb"/>Śiśupāla. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 42, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(15) It was Bhīṣma who narrated the life story of Śiśu-
<div n="lb"/>pāla. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 43).
<div n="NI"/>(16) In the battle against Śiśupāla, Bhīṣma selected
<div n="lb"/>powerful Kings to help Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 44, Verse 41).
<div n="NI"/>(17) Once Bhīṣma asked the sage Pulastya about the
<div n="lb"/>value and importance of pilgrimage. (Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 82, Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(18) Bhīṣma advised Duryodhana to be on friendly
<div n="lb"/>terms with the Pāṇḍavas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 253,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(19) In the battle which was fought by Kauravas against
<div n="lb"/>King Virāṭa, Bhīṣma arranged the regiments in order,
<div n="lb"/>after sending Duryodhana to Hastināpura. (Virāṭa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 52, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(20) A grim fight took place between Arjuna who went
<div n="lb"/>to help the Virāṭa army and Bhīṣma. At last, it was the
<div n="lb"/>charioteer who removed Bhīṣma, (who had fallen down
<div n="lb"/>unconscious) from the battlefield. (Virāṭa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 64).
<div n="NI"/>(21) When the Kauravas were contemplating to fight
<div n="lb"/>against the Pāṇḍavas who had returned after their
<div n="lb"/>incognito life, Bhīṣma ridiculed Karṇa and praised
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 21, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(22) At that time, he explained to Duryodhana, the
<div n="lb"/>greatness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 49, verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(23) Duryodhana proposed to bind the hands and feet
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was expected to come as the envoy of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. Hearing this, Bhīṣma in great anger,
<div n="lb"/>walked out of the council hall. (Udyoga Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 88, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(24) Bhīṣma strongly advised Duryodhana to make a
<div n="lb"/>treaty of peace with the Pāṇḍavas. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 125, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(25) He declared that he would not kill the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>but would kill 10,000 soldiers of the Pāṇḍavas everyday.
<div n="lb"/>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156, Verse 21).
[Page137-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(26) As desired by Duryodhana, Bhīṣma declared the
<div n="lb"/>Rathīs and Mahārathīs who belonged to the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>side. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 165-168).
<div n="NI"/>(27) Bhīṣma described all the Mahārathīs of the Pāṇḍava
<div n="lb"/>side to Duryodhana. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 169-
<div n="lb"/>172).
<div n="NI"/>(28) Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that Śikhaṇḍī and the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas should not be killed. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>172, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(29) Bhīṣma offered pūjā to Paraśurāma. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 123, Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(30) Aṃbā who was allowed by Bhīṣma to marry her
<div n="lb"/>lover, King Śālva, was rejected by him and returned
<div n="lb"/>to Bhīṣma again. But he did not accept her. Although
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma pleaded with him on behalf of Aṃbā,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma did not marry her. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>178, Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(31) In connection with Ambā's case, a duel was fought
<div n="lb"/>on the field of Kurukṣetra between Bhīṣma and Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma. Bhīṣma started the duel after asking for the
<div n="lb"/>permission of Paraśurāma. Pleased with the fight, the
<div n="lb"/>Vasus presented to Bhīṣma, the Prasvāpana arrow. But
<div n="lb"/>he did not use that arrow against Paraśurāma, since
<div n="lb"/>the gods and Nārada prevented him from doing so.
<div n="lb"/>At the request of the gods, pitṛs and Gaṅgādevī, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>stopped the fight and prostrated at the feet of Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 178-185).
<div n="NI"/>(32) Bhīṣma narrated to Duryodhana the story of Ambā
<div n="lb"/>who was re-born as Śikhaṇḍī. (Udyoga parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>188-192).
<div n="NI"/>(33) Bhīṣma himself told Duryodhana that he had the
<div n="lb"/>strength to annihilate all the Pāṇḍavas. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 193, Verse 14).
<div n="NI"/>(34) Before the beginning of the battle, Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>went to Bhīṣma and asked for his permission to start it.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma granted him permission and blessed him.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 44).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Bhīṣma in Bhārata Yuddha.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) On the first day of the battle a duel took place bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween Bhīṣma and Arjuna. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 45,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(2) In the battle Bhīṣma killed Śveta, the son of king
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 3).
<div n="NI"/>(3) There was again a terrible fight with Arjuna. (Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 52).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Sātyaki killed Bhīṣma's charioteer. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 64, Verse 114).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Seeing that the army of the Kauravas was being
<div n="lb"/>scattered in all directions by the violent strokes of Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma ordered to stop the second day's battle. (Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 55, Verse 42).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Bhīṣma challenged Śrīkṛṣṇa for the fight. (Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 96).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Fought again with Arjuna. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>60, Verse 25).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Bhīṣma gave orders to Droṇācārya and Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>to save Bhagadatta who fell in danger. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 64, verse 64).
