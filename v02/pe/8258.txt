VIDULĀ¦. A heroic Kṣatriya woman of India. In Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Udyoga Parva, there is a story, how this
<div n="lb"/>Vidulā sent her son, who had fled from the battle-field
<div n="lb"/>because of fear, back to the battlefield again.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas, who had completed forest-life and
<div n="lb"/>Pseudonymity successfully and returned to Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>were again deceived and put to shame. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>argument as a mediator was not successful, in the
[Page848-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>palace of the Kauravas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came away from
<div n="lb"/>the palace of Duryodhana and entered the house of
<div n="lb"/>Vidura and visited Kuntī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa asked her opinion
<div n="lb"/>on the idea of waging a war against the Kauravas. It
<div n="lb"/>is not meet and right on the part of a heroic mother to
<div n="lb"/>welcome a son who comes home being defeated in
<div n="lb"/>battle. To substantiate this point, she told Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>the story of Vidulā, as given below.
<div n="NI"/>Vidulā was a brave woman, who lived in ancient India.
<div n="lb"/>Her son Sañjaya fought with the King of Sindhu and
<div n="lb"/>was defeated. When he came home Vidulā did not
<div n="lb"/>receive him. She emboldened him by saying that she
<div n="lb"/>would be more proud of a son, who had sacrificed his
<div n="lb"/>life, in the battlefield than one who returned home
<div n="lb"/>defeated. All his arguments which were excuses for his
<div n="lb"/>cowardice, were refuted by his mother. At last Sañjaya
<div n="lb"/>engaged again in a battle with the King of Sindhu.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this story told by Kuntī Śrī Kṛṣṇa became
<div n="lb"/>immensely pleased. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, 3 Chapters
<div n="lb"/>from 134).
