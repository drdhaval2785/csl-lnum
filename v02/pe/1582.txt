CITRĀṄGADĀ II¦. A wife of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>{%General information.%} When once Dharmaputra was
<div n="lb"/>closeted with Pāñcālī in amorous talks Arjuna by mis-
<div n="lb"/>take entered the room and was thus compelled as per
<div n="lb"/>a previous mutual agreement to go on a pilgrimage for a
<div n="lb"/>year. During this exile he married the serpent girl
<div n="lb"/>Ulūpī. After that he proceeded again on his pilgrimage
<div n="lb"/>and reached a state called Maṇalūr. Maṇalūr was then
<div n="lb"/>reigned by a King called Citravāhana. Citrāṅgadā
<div n="lb"/>was the daughter of Citravāhana.
<div n="NI"/>An ancestor of Citravāhana greatly grieved by the lack
<div n="lb"/>of a son, did great penance to propitiate Śiva and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>blessed him and said that in future he and his successors
[Page185-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>would get a son to keep their line unbroken. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>all the forefathers of Citravāhana got a son each but
<div n="lb"/>when it came to the turn of the latter he got a girl
<div n="lb"/>instead.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna accidentally saw Citrāṅgadā and fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>her, and knowing that, the king received Arjuna in his
<div n="lb"/>palace and requested Arjuna to marry his daughter.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna married her and the couple got a son named
<div n="lb"/>Babhruvāhana. Promising them that he would come
<div n="lb"/>back and take them to Hastināpura Arjuna continued
<div n="lb"/>his pilgrimage. (Chapters 219, 220, and 221, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Citrāṅgadā came to Hastināpura.%} When after the
<div n="lb"/>great epic battle Dharmaputra conducted an Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medhayajña it was Arjuna who led the sacrificial horse
<div n="lb"/>to the south. When Arjuna came to Maṇalūr he came
<div n="lb"/>against Babhruvāhana who challenged him for a fight.
<div n="lb"/>In the grim battle that ensued Arjuna fell dead by the
<div n="lb"/>piercing arrows of Babhruvāhana, his own son. At that
<div n="lb"/>time Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā came to the scene and
<div n="lb"/>seeing Arjuna lying dead, Ulūpī brought the diamond,
<div n="lb"/>Mṛtasañjīvanī, and placing it on Arjuna's face brought
<div n="lb"/>him back to life. (See Babhruvāhana for details).
<div n="lb"/>After this incident all of them, Citrāṅgadā, Ulūpī and
<div n="lb"/>Babhruvāhana went to Hastināpura along with Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 79 to 81, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Citrāṅgadā on reaching Hastināpura bowed down
<div n="lb"/>before Kuntī and Pāñcālī touching their feet and lived
<div n="lb"/>amicably with others like Subhadrā. (Śloka 2, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>88, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Kuntī, Subhadrā and Pāñcālī gave Citrāṅgadā
<div n="lb"/>many diamonds as present. (Śloka 3, Chapter 88,
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Citrāṅgadā looked to the comforts of Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>as a servant-maid. (Śloka 23, Chapter 1, Āśramavāsika
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Citrāṅgadā was one among the women who wept
<div n="lb"/>when at the fag end of their life Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>and Kuntī started for Vanavāsa (life in the forest).
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 10, Chapter 15, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Citrāṅgadā was a beautiful woman having an
<div n="lb"/>enchanting figure as that of a Madhūka flower. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>11, Chapter 25, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) After the Mahāprasthāna of the Pāṇḍavas Citrāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>gadā left for Maṇipur. (Śloka 18, Chapter 1, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>prasthānika Parva).
