KĀŚĪ I¦. (VĀRĀṆASĪ. BANARAS). (See under Divo-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa also).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} One of the oldest and most popular
<div n="lb"/>sacred centres in India, Kāśī is reputed for its Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>nātha temple of hoary traditions, according to one of
<div n="lb"/>which the Śivaliṅga in the temple was installed by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā himself. (Hālāsya Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pilgrimage on foot to Kāśī.%} Devotees from many
<div n="lb"/>parts of India go on pilgrimage to Kāśī on foot, bathe
<div n="lb"/>in the holy waters of the Gaṅgā and thus earn spiritual
<div n="lb"/>satisfaction and release from worldly attachments. The
<div n="lb"/>reason for the above is stated in the Agni Purāṇa as
<div n="lb"/>follows:— Once, at Kailāsa Śiva told Pārvatī that the
<div n="lb"/>temple at Kāśī was called ‘Avimukta’ (unreleased) as
<div n="lb"/>it never perished, and all Japa, tapa, homa and dāna
<div n="lb"/>made there never cease to give auspicious results. One
<div n="lb"/>should walk on foot to Kāśī and live there. Having
<div n="lb"/>gone there one should never leave the place. There are
<div n="lb"/>eight great tīrthas at Avimukta, i.e. Hariścandra tīrtha,
<div n="lb"/>Āvrātakeśvara tīrtha, Japyeśvara tīrtha, Śrī Parva-
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha, Mahālayatīrtha, Bhṛgu tīrtha, Caṇḍeśvara
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha and Kedāratīrtha. These tīrthas extend to two
<div n="lb"/>yojanas to the east of the Kāśī temple and half-a-
<div n="lb"/>yojana to the west of it. The river Varaṇā is also there,
<div n="lb"/>and Vārāṇasī is at the centre of all these. Whatever is
<div n="lb"/>done at Vārāṇasī like bath, Japa, homa, worship of
<div n="lb"/>Devas, dāna, obsequies for the dead, oneself living there
<div n="lb"/>etc. is productive of devotion and salvation. (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 112).
