ADITI¦. 1) {%Genealogy.%} Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>son of Marīci married Aditi, daughter of Dakṣaprajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati. Aditi had twelve sisters: Diti, Kālā, Danāyus,
<div n="lb"/>Danu, Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pṛthā, Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā,
<div n="lb"/>Muni and Kadrū. (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, Verse 12). Devas are sons born to Kaśyapa by Aditi
<div n="lb"/>and hence they are known as Āditeyas also. Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>married all the thirteen sisters including Aditi, and
[Page003-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>all living beings owe their origin to them. (See Kaś-
<div n="lb"/>yapa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Descendants.%} 33 sons were born to Aditi. 12 of them
<div n="lb"/>are called Dvādaśādityas, viz. Dhātā, Aryamā, Mitra,
<div n="lb"/>Śakra, Varuṇa, Aṃśa, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā, Savitā,
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣṭā and Viṣṇu. Amongst the other 21 sons are the
<div n="lb"/>11 Rudras and 8 Vasus. (See M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 65, Verse 15).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Main incidents.%} 1. {%How Mahāviṣṇu was born as the%}
<div n="lb"/>{%son of Aditi.%} The Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>refer to a story about the birth of Mahāviṣṇu as the
<div n="lb"/>son of Aditi. Viṣṇu entered the womb of Aditi as
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana (Dwarf). This story was related by the sage
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra to the boys Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa while
<div n="lb"/>they were accompanying the sage in the forest. When
<div n="lb"/>they entered Siddhāśrama Viśvāmitra pointed to the
<div n="lb"/>latter that the Āśrama was sacred, because Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>had stayed there for long as Vāmana. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>induced Mahāviṣṇu to obstruct the sacrifice (yāga)
<div n="lb"/>being performed by Emperor Mahābali, son of
<div n="lb"/>Virocana. At that time Aditi, the wife of Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>was doing penance so that Mahāviṣṇu might be born
<div n="lb"/>as her son, and accordingly he entered her womb.
<div n="lb"/>1000 years later she gave birth to Viṣṇu, and that child
<div n="lb"/>was known as Vāmana. (See Vāmana; also M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 272, Verse 62, Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 83, Verses 25 and 26, as also Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Canto 29).
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Rebirth of Aditi.%} Once Kaśyapa made all arrange-
<div n="lb"/>ments to perform a sacrifice (yāga). Having failed to
<div n="lb"/>get the suitable cow for it, he stole Varuṇa's cow and
<div n="lb"/>conducted the yāga. Not only that, Kaśyapa refused
<div n="lb"/>to return the cow even after the yāga was over.
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa in hot anger rushed to Kaśyapa's hermitage.
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa was absent, and his wives, Aditi and Surasā
<div n="lb"/>did not treat Varuṇa with due respect. The enraged
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa cursed them to be born in Gokula. He also
<div n="lb"/>complained about the matter to Brahmā. Brahmā told
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa: “Since you, a learned person, have stolen
<div n="lb"/>the cow, may you along with your wives be born in
<div n="lb"/>Gokula and tend cows”. Accordingly Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb"/>his wives, Aditi and Surasā, were born respectively as
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva, Devakī and Rohiṇī in Gokula in the 28th
<div n="lb"/>Dvāpara yuga. (This story has been told by Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>to Rājā Janamejaya). (Devībhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>3. {%Aditi in prison.%} Devakī is Aditi reborn. There was
<div n="lb"/>reason for Devakī being imprisoned on the orders of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. When Kaśyapa was living in an Āśrama with
<div n="lb"/>Aditi and Diti he was so much pleased with the
<div n="lb"/>services of Aditi that he asked her to beg for any
<div n="lb"/>boon she wished. Accordingly she prayed for an
<div n="lb"/>ideal son. The boon was readily granted, and Indra
<div n="lb"/>was the son thus born to her. The birth of Indra
<div n="lb"/>engendered jealousy in Diti towards Aditi, and she
<div n="lb"/>also demanded a son equal to Indra. Kaśyapa obliged
<div n="lb"/>Diti also. As Diti advanced in pregnancy and her
<div n="lb"/>beauty also increased Aditi got jealous of the former
<div n="lb"/>and she called her son Indra and told him that unless
<div n="lb"/>something was done in time, Diti would deliver a
<div n="lb"/>child equal to him (Indra) thus relegating him pro-
<div n="lb"/>bably to the place of second Deva. Thus admonished
<div n="lb"/>by his mother the artful Indra approached Diti and
<div n="lb"/>told her: “Mother, I have come to serve you”. Diti
<div n="lb"/>was greatly pleased. Indra's services drove Diti to
<div n="lb"/>sleep very quickly, and Indra used the opportunity
[Page004-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to enter the womb of Diti and cut into 49 pieces the
<div n="lb"/>child with his weapon, the Vajra. The child in the
<div n="lb"/>womb began crying on receiving cuts with Vajra when
<div n="lb"/>Indra asked it not to cry. (Mā ruda, don't cry) and
<div n="lb"/>so the child got out of Diti's womb as 49 Mārutas
<div n="lb"/>(winds). Then did Diti wake up and cursed Aditi as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “Your son did treacherously kill my
<div n="lb"/>offspring in the womb itself. So he will forfeit the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds. You were responsible for the murder of
<div n="lb"/>my child. You will, therefore, have to spend days in
<div n="lb"/>prison grieving over your children. Your children also
<div n="lb"/>will be annihilated”. Because of this curse of Diti,
<div n="lb"/>Indra once lost Devaloka and had to live elsewhere,
<div n="lb"/>and Nahuṣa functioned, for a time as Indra. (See
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa). In the 28th Dvāpara yuga Aditi trans-
<div n="lb"/>formed as Devakī had to be a captive of Kaṃsa, and
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa killed her children by dashing them on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. (Devībhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>4. {%Narakāsura stole the earrings of Aditi.%} Narakāsura, who
<div n="lb"/>turned out to be a curse and menace to the three worlds
<div n="lb"/>consequent on the boon he got from Viṣṇu, attacked
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka once, and carried off Indra's royal umbrella
<div n="lb"/>and Aditi's earrings. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself as
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, killed Narakāsura in battle and got back the
<div n="lb"/>earrings etc. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 48, Verse
<div n="lb"/>80; Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38, Verse 29; Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>Daśama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5. {%Mahāviṣṇu became seven times son to Aditi.%} Once, de-
<div n="lb"/>sirous of having children Aditi cooked food (rice)
<div n="lb"/>sitting herself in the entrails of Mount Mynaka (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇya Parva, Chapter 135, Verse 3). Dharmaputra,
<div n="lb"/>in the course of singing the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa after
<div n="lb"/>the great war refers to Viṣṇu having taken birth
<div n="lb"/>seven times in the womb of Aditi. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 43, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>6. {%Budha cursed Aditi.%} A story in the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>refers to Budha's once cursing Aditi. The ever increas-
<div n="lb"/>ing power of Asuras made the Devas anxious. Aditi,
<div n="lb"/>the mother of the Devas decided to send them all to
<div n="lb"/>annihilate the Asuras. She had finished cooking food
<div n="lb"/>for her sons, and lo! there appeared before her Budha
<div n="lb"/>and asked for food. Aditi asked him to wait pending
<div n="lb"/>her sons taking their food hoping that there would be
<div n="lb"/>some food left after that. This caused Budha to lose
<div n="lb"/>his temper and he cursed her that (Aditi) she would
<div n="lb"/>become the mother of Vivasvān in his second birth
<div n="lb"/>as Aṇḍa, when she would suffer pain in her abdomen.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 34, Verses 96-98).
<div n="NI"/>7. {%Former birth of Aditi.%} During the former years
<div n="lb"/>(period) of Svāyambhuva Manu the Prajāpati called
<div n="lb"/>Sutapas, along with his wife Pṛśni did Tapas for
<div n="lb"/>12000 years. Then Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them,
<div n="lb"/>and Pṛśni prayed for a son like Viṣṇu himself, and
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu was born as her son named Pṛśnigarbha.
<div n="lb"/>This story is related by Śrī Kṛsna to his mother on
<div n="lb"/>his birth as the son of Vasudeva. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>She, who became the wife of Prajāpati as Pṛśni before
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva Manu, and was born again as Devakī,
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Vasudeva is one and the same person.
