GOHATYĀ¦. In ancient India killing of cows was con-
<div n="lb"/>sidered to be a great sin. It is interesting to note the
<div n="lb"/>punishment prescribed for this crime in the Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa. For one month he should drink barley water
<div n="lb"/>only. He should live in a cow-shed wearing the hide of
<div n="lb"/>the cow he has killed. He can have some supper and
<div n="lb"/>that too without salt He must bathe for two months in
<div n="lb"/>cow's urine. During day time he should follow the cows
<div n="lb"/>looking after their comfort. He should drink the
<div n="lb"/>menstrual discharge with his face lifted upwards.
<div n="lb"/>Fasting, he should give away as charity ten cows and a
<div n="lb"/>bull. If not, he should give as charity all his wealth to
<div n="lb"/>god-fearing brahmins. If a man only stops the cow for
<div n="lb"/>others to kill he should bear a fourth of the punishment;
<div n="lb"/>if he stops and ties it for killing he should bear half of
<div n="lb"/>the punishment and if he stops it, ties it and gives the
<div n="lb"/>weapon for killing he should bear three-fourths of the
<div n="lb"/>punishment. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 159),
