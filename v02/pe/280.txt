ANDHAKA III¦. An Asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This Asura was the foster son of Hiraṇyākṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva was really his father. While once Śiva was
<div n="lb"/>immersed in yoga his daughter closed his eyes play-
<div n="lb"/>fully with her hands, and lo! a darkness rose and
<div n="lb"/>enveloped the whole place. From that darkness, with
<div n="lb"/>a sound as that of thunderbolt, appeared a Rākṣasa.
<div n="lb"/>He got the name Andhaka as he was born from dark-
<div n="lb"/>ness. At that time Hiraṇyākṣa was doing tapas for a
<div n="lb"/>son. Śiva appeared before him and bestowing on him
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka as a foster son said as follows: “If he
<div n="lb"/>(Andhaka) earns the hatred of the world or desires
<div n="lb"/>even the mother of the three worlds or kills brahmins
<div n="lb"/>I will myself burn him to ashes”. After saying this
<div n="lb"/>Śiva disappeared. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Andhaka desires Pārvatī with lust.%} One day overcome
<div n="lb"/>by erotic passion Andhaka said to his henchmen as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “He is my true friend who brings Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>consort, Pārvatī to me. Yes, he is my brother, nay,
<div n="lb"/>father even.” Hearing these ravings of Andhaka,
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda went to him and convinced him that Pārvatī,
[Page036-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in fact was his mother. But Andhaka was not quieten-
<div n="lb"/>ed. Then Prahlāda explained to him the gravity of
<div n="lb"/>the sin of desiring other people's wives. Even this had
<div n="lb"/>no effect on Andhaka. He sent Śambarāsura to Śiva
<div n="lb"/>to ask for and bring Pārvatī to him. Śiva sent word to
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka that if the latter would defeat him in the
<div n="lb"/>game of dice Pārvatī would be sent to him. Andhaka
<div n="lb"/>got enraged and rushed to mount Mandara and began
<div n="lb"/>a fight with Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Death.%} Defeated in the encounter, Andhaka craved
<div n="lb"/>for Śiva's pardon. He admitted that Pārvatī was his
<div n="lb"/>mother. He also prayed for Śiva's blessings for removal
<div n="lb"/>of his Asurahood. Śiva granted him the prayers. The
<div n="lb"/>sins and Asurahood of Andhaka were thus ended. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>made him the head of the Asuras, named Bhṛṅgi.
<div n="lb"/>(Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 63 etc.).
