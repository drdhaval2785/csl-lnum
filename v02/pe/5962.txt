<div n="lb"/>was the son of the Vasu Anala and the younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of Subrahmaṇya and that he had two brothers

<div n="lb"/>Chapter 15, part 1 of Viṣṇu Purāṇa as follows:- “Āpa,
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Agni, Pratyūṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāsa are the aṣṭavasus. Vaitaṇḍa, Śrama, Śānta,
<div n="lb"/>and Dhvani were sons of Āpa. Kāla, who annihilates
<div n="lb"/>the entire world is the son of Dhruva and Varccas is
<div n="lb"/>Soma's son. Varccas gives people the vital glow.
<div n="lb"/>Draviṇa, Hutahavyavaha, Śiśvara, Prāṇa and Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>were the sons of Dharma by Manoharā. Anila's wife
<div n="lb"/>was Śivā, and two sons, Manojava and Avijñatagati
<div n="lb"/>were born to the couple. Kumāra, son of Agni was born
<div n="lb"/>in Śarastamba and he had three brothers called Śākha,
<div n="lb"/>Viśākha and Naigameya.”
<div n="NI"/>The following story about the birth of Śākha is from
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 6, Lāvāṇakalambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara:
<div n="lb"/>Defeated in battle by Tārakāsura, Indra decided to
<div n="lb"/>have no more fight with him and retired to Mount
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru. Devas and maharṣis sought asylum with
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya, who gave them protection. Indra
<div n="lb"/>came to know of it and fought with Subrahmaṇya
<div n="lb"/>feeling that the latter had captured his kingdom. Two
<div n="lb"/>sons, Śākha and Viśākha were born from the face of
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya wounded by the Vajrāyudha of Indra.
