TRIJAṬA¦ (GĀRGYA). A sage. Though he was a sage
<div n="lb"/>he lived by farming. He had a wife and children and
<div n="lb"/>his earnings from farm work were insufficient to make
<div n="lb"/>both ends meet. They were living in poverty and it
[Page792-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was at that time that Rāma started for his life in exile
<div n="lb"/>in the forests. Before he commenced his journey to
<div n="lb"/>the forests he gave immense wealth to all the Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>who had assembled around him. At that time Trijaṭa
<div n="lb"/>never knew about it and when it came to the ears of
<div n="lb"/>Trijaṭa's wife she ran to the fields and persuaded
<div n="lb"/>Trijaṭa to go and see Śrī Rāma. When Trijaṭa came to
<div n="lb"/>the scene, Rāma had almost finished his distribution,
<div n="lb"/>but Trijaṭa took courage and pushing forward through
<div n="lb"/>the crowd approached Rāma and said “Oh, famous
<div n="lb"/>King, I am a poor man with many children. Give
<div n="lb"/>something for this poor man who lives by farming.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this, Śrī Rāma giving him a small stick asked
<div n="lb"/>him to throw the stick into the midst of the cattle
<div n="lb"/>grazing nearby. The Brahmin tightening his clothes
<div n="lb"/>and getting ready threw the stick with all his might
<div n="lb"/>to the south. The stick fell beyond a lakh of cattle
<div n="lb"/>grazing there. Śrī Rāma gave him all the cattle which
<div n="lb"/>stood inside the area covered by the stick. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>32, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Trijaṭa was the son of Viśvāmitra. (Śloka 55, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>4, Anuśāsana Parva).
