PURŪRAVAS¦. I. A prominent king of Candravaṃśa
<div n="lb"/>(lunar race).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin of Candravaṃśa and birth of Purūravas.%} Descend-
<div n="lb"/>ing in order from Brahmā came Atri—Candra—Budha
<div n="lb"/>Purūravas. The dynasty which came from Candra was
<div n="lb"/>called the Candravaṃśa. Though Budha was the first
<div n="lb"/>king of Candravaṃśa it was Purūravas who became
<div n="lb"/>celebrated. The story of the birth of Purūravas is given
<div n="lb"/>below:
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā in the beginning deputed the sage Atri for the
<div n="lb"/>work of creation. Atrimaharṣi started the penance
<div n="lb"/>called anuttara to acquire sufficient power for creation.
<div n="lb"/>After some years Saccidānanda brahma with an aura of
<div n="lb"/>lustre reflected in the heart of that pure and serene
<div n="lb"/>soul. In sheer ecstasy tears rolled down his cheeks and
<div n="lb"/>the glittering flow of water was lustfully drunk by the
<div n="lb"/>zones taking the form of women with a view to produc-
<div n="lb"/>ing progenies. They became pregnant but were un-
<div n="lb"/>able to bear the embryo of Atri and so they threw them
<div n="lb"/>away. Brahmā took them all and made them into one
<div n="lb"/>armoured youth and took him in his chariot to his land.
<div n="lb"/>Then the brahmarṣis requested Brahmā to make him
<div n="lb"/>their lord. When the rṣis, devas, gandharvas and
<div n="lb"/>nymphs praised him reciting sāmaveda the majestic
<div n="lb"/>lustre of the youth increased. It was from this that
<div n="lb"/>auṣadhas (medicines) originated and that is why
<div n="lb"/>Candra is considered to be the lord of medicines, dvija
<div n="lb"/>and Vedasvarūpa. The Candramaṇḍala is full of
<div n="lb"/>chemicals. It increases and decreases according to the
<div n="lb"/>white half and black half of the moon-based month.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa gave in marriage to Candra twentyseven beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful maidens. Then Candra did penance meditating
<div n="lb"/>on Viṣṇu for ten thousand Kalpas. Viṣṇu pleased by
<div n="lb"/>his penance asked him to name a boon and Candra said
<div n="lb"/>“When I perform a yāga in svarga all the devas like
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā should come in person to my yāgaśālā and
<div n="lb"/>take the yāgabhāga. Śūlapāṇi should remain as a
<div n="lb"/>watchman at my Rājasūya.” Accordingly with the
<div n="lb"/>blessing of Viṣṇu, Candra conducted the yāga in which
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Bhṛgu, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Devas, Vasus, Maruts
<div n="lb"/>and Viśvadevas took part. Candra gave as yāga-fees
<div n="lb"/>to Ṛtviks all the three worlds. The yāga was complete
<div n="lb"/>and when Candra rose up after a bath nine devīs fell in
<div n="lb"/>love with the amorous beauty of Candra. Lakṣmī, wife
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu, Sinīvālī, wife of Kardama, Dyuti, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Vibhāvasu, Puṣṭi, wife of Dhātā, Prabhā, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya, Kuhū, wife of Haviṣmān, Kīrti, wife of Jayanta,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśumālī wife of Kaśyapa and Dhṛti wife of Nanda,
<div n="lb"/>abandoned their husbands and went with Candra.
<div n="lb"/>Candra treated them all as his own wives and gave
<div n="lb"/>them erotic pleasure to their hearts' content. Those
<div n="lb"/>who saw this non-virtuous act stood dumbfounded un-
<div n="lb"/>able to curse Candra.
<div n="NI"/>Attracted by the dazzling brilliance of Candra Tārā,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Bṛhaspati, went with him. Enraged at this, Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati joining with other devas prepared for a fight
<div n="lb"/>against Candra. Devas took sides and by the media-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Indra a conference of both the parties was
<div n="lb"/>held and Tārā was sent back to Bṛhaspati. Tārā was
<div n="lb"/>pregnant then and Tārā confessed that the child in her
<div n="lb"/>womb was that of Candra. So when that child was
[Page620-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>born Candra took it away and named it Budha. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and other ṛṣis gave Budha a seat among the planets.
<div n="NI"/>Budha married Ilā and they got a son named Purūravas.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Ilā). After that Budha performed a hundred
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedhayāgas. He then enjoyed world prosperity
<div n="lb"/>as lord of Saptadvīpa living in the beautiful Himādri-
<div n="lb"/>śṛṅga. worshipping Brahmā. (Chapter 12, Bhāga 3,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Testing Purūravas and the curse.%} Purūravas by his bril-
<div n="lb"/>liance performed a hundred Aśvamedhayāgas and lived
<div n="lb"/>in glory at Himādriśṛṅga. Great demons like Keśī
<div n="lb"/>became his servants. Urvaśī attracted by his beauty
<div n="lb"/>became his wife. While he was living like that Dharma,
<div n="lb"/>Artha and Kāma went in disguise to his palace to test
<div n="lb"/>him. Hereceived them all well but paid more attention to
<div n="lb"/>Dharma. Artha and Kāma got angry and cursed him.
<div n="lb"/>Artha cursed him saying that he would be ruined by
<div n="lb"/>his greed and Kāma cursed him saying he would go
<div n="lb"/>mad by being separated from Urvaśī. Hearing that
<div n="lb"/>Dharma blessed him thus: “You will live long lead-
<div n="lb"/>ing a virtuous life. Your race will increase and
<div n="lb"/>remain in glory till the end of the moon and the stars.
<div n="lb"/>The insanity caused by your passion for Urvaśī would
<div n="lb"/>end by the end of sixty years. That celestial maiden
<div n="lb"/>would remain then with you for one Manvantara.”
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 12, Bhāga 3, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Purūravas used to visit Indra daily. One day while he
<div n="lb"/>was going through air well-armed with a bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrows he saw a demon named Keśī carrying away
<div n="lb"/>by force Urvaśī and Citralekhā and after defeating
<div n="lb"/>Keśī in a fight recovered the nymphs and gave them
<div n="lb"/>back to Indra. Indra praised Purūravas and in his
<div n="lb"/>honour a drama, Lakṣmīsvayaṃvara, was enacted by
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī, Menakā and others. Urvaśī taking the part of
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī started to dance but seeing Purūravas before
<div n="lb"/>her she became lustful and made wrong steps. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>who was present at the function got angry and cursed her
<div n="lb"/>“You will forget all you have learnt. Not only that,
<div n="lb"/>you will live as a creeper separated from Purūravas for
<div n="lb"/>a period of sixty years.” (For details see under Urvaśī).
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa says that it was Bharata who cursed
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī. This story is slightly different from that found
<div n="lb"/>in the other Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sons of Purūravas.%} Urvaśī got eight sons of Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>named Āyus, Dṛḍhāyus, Vaśyāyus, Danāyus, Vṛttimān,
<div n="lb"/>Vasu, Divijāta and Subāhu. Of these Āyus became the
<div n="lb"/>propagator of the dynasty. Of the sons born to Āyus
<div n="lb"/>five sons, Nahuṣa, Vṛddhaśarmā, Raji, Dambha and
<div n="lb"/>Vipāpmā became celebrities. A hundred sons were
<div n="lb"/>born to Raji. They were called Rājeyas. (Chapter 12,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāga 3, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Some Purāṇas state that Purūravas had six sons while
<div n="lb"/>some state that he had seven sons.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} The following references are made
<div n="lb"/>about him in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Purūravas stole the wealth of some brahmins.
<div n="lb"/>The brahmins took Sanatkumāra along with them and
<div n="lb"/>made representations to the king. Purūravas did not
<div n="lb"/>give back their wealth. The brahmins cursed him and as
<div n="lb"/>a result the prosperity of the King waned. Then Purū-
<div n="lb"/>ravas brought down from svarga three Agnis and per-
<div n="lb"/>formed a yāga and thus regained his lost splendour
<div n="lb"/>and prosperity. (Chapter 75, Ādi Parva).
[Page621-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Purūravas got six sons of Urvaśī named Āyus,
<div n="lb"/>Dhīmān, Amāvasu, Dṛḍhāyus, Vanāyus and Śatāyus.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once he asked Vāyu the wind-god about the origin
<div n="lb"/>of the four castes and the superiority of the brahmins
<div n="lb"/>over other castes. (Śloka 3, Chapter 72, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) At another time he discussed about yajñapurohitas
<div n="lb"/>with Kaśyapa. (Chapter 73, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Ikṣvāku gave Purūravas a sword which in his old
<div n="lb"/>age he gave to his son Āyus. (Chapter 166, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) He once declared that one can attain svarga by
<div n="lb"/>the blessings of brahmins. (Śloka 31, Chapter 6, Anu-
<div n="lb"/>śāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Purūravas was famous as a donor of cows. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>26, Chapter 76, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Purūravas never ate meat. (Śloka 65, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>111, Anuśāsana Parva).
