ĀBHĪRAS¦.
<div n="NI"/>{%A few details:%} 1) A low-caste people. People living in
<div n="lb"/>the estuary of the rivers of Sindhū and Sarasvatī were
<div n="lb"/>generally called Ābhīras. In the Sabhā Parva of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata we find Nakula defeating these people during
<div n="lb"/>his victory march after the great Mahābhārata battle.
<div n="NI"/>2) Once Ābhīras went to Dharmaputra with many
<div n="lb"/>gifts. (Ślokas 11-13, Chapter 51, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) Once it was prophesied by Mārkaṇḍeya Ṛṣi, that
<div n="lb"/>low-caste people like Ābhīras and Śakas would become
<div n="lb"/>rulers of states in different parts of Bhārata during
<div n="lb"/>Kaliyuga. (Ślokas 35-36, Chapter 188, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) In the Garuḍavyūha (Battle array named after
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa) which Droṇa created during the Kurukṣetra
<div n="lb"/>battle he included Ābhīras also. (Śloka 6, Chapter 20,
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) Because of the hatred of Śūdras and Ābhīras a sac-
<div n="lb"/>red lake named Vināśana disappeared from the river,
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī. (Ślokas 1 and 2, Chapter 37, Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) Ābhīras were Kṣatriyas formerly. Afraid of Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma they fled and lived in mountain-caves not conti-
<div n="lb"/>nuing their hereditary work and thus became Śūdras.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 16, Chapter 29, Aśvamedhika Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>7) When Dvārakā was destroyed by floods and all the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas were killed Arjuna went north taking along with
<div n="lb"/>him the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. At that time Ābhīras were
<div n="lb"/>among those who attacked and carried away the
<div n="lb"/>women. (Ślokas 47-63, Chapter 7, Mausalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
