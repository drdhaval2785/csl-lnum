JYĀMAGHA¦. A King born in the dynasty of Ikṣvāku.
<div n="lb"/>(Harivaṃśa, Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>Five sons, who were equal to gods, named Sahasrada,
<div n="lb"/>Payoda, Kroṣṭā, Nīla and Ājika were born to Yadu of
<div n="lb"/>the family of Ikṣvāku. Several noble persons were born
<div n="lb"/>in the family of Kroṣṭā. A noble and broadminded son
<div n="lb"/>named Vṛjinīvān was born to Kroṣṭā. Śvāhi was born
<div n="lb"/>to Vṛjinīvān, Ruśeku to Śvāhi, Citraratha to Ruśeku
<div n="lb"/>and Śaśabindu to Citraratha. Thousand sons were born
<div n="lb"/>to Śaśabindu who was an emperor. Important among
<div n="lb"/>those thousand who were blessed with radiance, fame,
<div n="lb"/>wealth and beauty, were Pṛthuśravas, Pṛthuyaśas,
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthutejas, Pṛthubhava, Pṛthukīrti and Pṛthumati.
<div n="lb"/>Uśanas was the son of Pṛthuśravas, Śineyu was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Uśanas and Rukmakavaca the son of Śineyu. Ruk-
<div n="lb"/>makavaca killed all the archers and conquered the
<div n="lb"/>countries and performing aśvamedha (horse sacrifice)
<div n="lb"/>gave away all the countries he conquered, as gift to
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas. Five sons were born to Rukmakavaca. Jyā-
<div n="lb"/>magha was one of them. His brothers were Rukmeṣu,
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthurukma, Parigha and Hari. Of them Parigha and
<div n="lb"/>Hari were made Kings of foreign countries. Rukmeṣu
<div n="lb"/>was given the country ruled by his father. Pṛthurukma
<div n="lb"/>served Rukmeṣu. They drove Jyāmagha away from the
<div n="lb"/>country.
<div n="NI"/>Jyāmagha went to the forest and erected a hermitage
<div n="lb"/>for him. Then according to the advice of a Brahmin, he
<div n="lb"/>who was an old man took bow and arrow and got into
<div n="lb"/>a chariot flying a flag and went to the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river Narmadā. He had neither wealth nor attendants.
<div n="lb"/>He stayed on the mountain Ṛkṣavān eating fruits and
<div n="lb"/>roots. His wife Śaibyā also had become old. They had
<div n="lb"/>no children. Still Jyāmagha did not marry anybody
<div n="lb"/>else. Once Jyāmagha came out victorious in a fight in
<div n="lb"/>which he got a girl. Jyāmagha took the girl to his wife
<div n="lb"/>and told her, “This girl shall be the wife of your son.”
<div n="lb"/>She asked him how that could be when she had no
<div n="lb"/>son. He said, “She will become the wife of the son who
<div n="lb"/>is going to be born to you.” As a result of severe
<div n="lb"/>penance a son named Vidarbha was born to Śaibyā.
<div n="lb"/>The damsel who became the wife of Vidarbha gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to two sons named Kratha and Kaiśika. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 13).
