NARAVĀHANADATTA¦. A famous Vidyādhara.
<div n="lb"/>Udayana the King of Vatsa had been spending his time
<div n="lb"/>in play and pleasure with his wives Padmāvatī and
<div n="lb"/>Vāsavadattā, when once Nārada appeared before them.
<div n="lb"/>The king greeted the hermit and showed hospitality.
<div n="lb"/>The King and the queens were childless. Nārada told
<div n="lb"/>them: “Hear, oh King. Your wife Vāsavadattā is the
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Ratidevī blessed by Śiva. The son born
<div n="lb"/>to her would become the emperor of the Vidyādharas.
<div n="lb"/>Not long after this Vāsavadattā conceived and gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a radiant son. He was named Naravāhana-datta.
<div n="lb"/>At this time Kaliṅgasenā, who had been transformed into
<div n="lb"/>a woman by the curse of Indra, gave birth to an
<div n="lb"/>extra-ordinarily beautiful girl. (For detailed story see
<div n="lb"/>under Kaliṅgasenā). That child was named Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañcukā. Even in infancy she was surrounded by a halo
<div n="lb"/>of unearthly beauty. Hearing of this child, Vāsavadattā
<div n="lb"/>brought Kaliṅgasenā and the infant to the palace. To
<div n="lb"/>the wonder of everybody, the infants looked at each
<div n="lb"/>other and they were not satisfied how soever long they
<div n="lb"/>looked at each other. The king and his wives under-
<div n="lb"/>stood this perfectly well and at the proper time their
<div n="lb"/>marriage was conducted.
<div n="NI"/>Naravāhanadatta was anointed as the Heir-apparent.
<div n="lb"/>Once he was playing in the garden in the spring season,
<div n="lb"/>with his ministers Gomukha and others, when the most
<div n="lb"/>beautiful Ratnaprabhā came there. (See under Ratna-
<div n="lb"/>prabhā).
<div n="NI"/>Once Naravāhanadatta went for hunting with his
<div n="lb"/>minister Gomukha and retinue. Somehow or other he
<div n="lb"/>was separated from Gomukha and army in the deep
<div n="lb"/>forest. Then he heard a divine song and sound of a
<div n="lb"/>heavenly lyre. He went in the direction from which
<div n="lb"/>the music came. and reached a Śaivite temple. Getting
<div n="lb"/>in, he saw an excessively beautiful damsel standing in
<div n="lb"/>the midst of her attendants and companions singing
<div n="lb"/>and playing on a lute, in praise of Śiva. At this time a
<div n="lb"/>grown-up Vidyādhara woman came down from the sky
<div n="lb"/>and getting near the damsel, gave her to Naravāhana-
<div n="lb"/>datta. The name of the Vidyādhara damsel was
<div n="lb"/>Alaṅkāravatī. (For other details see under Alaṅkāra-
<div n="lb"/>vatī).
<div n="NI"/>As Naravāhanadatta was spending his days, enjoying the
<div n="lb"/>pleasing company of his wife Alaṅkāravatī, once he
<div n="lb"/>went for hunting, with his army. Being very tired they
<div n="lb"/>went in search of water, and entered a thick forest.
<div n="lb"/>There they saw a lake full of golden lotus flowers and
<div n="lb"/>four men plucking flowers. Naravāhanadatta approached
<div n="lb"/>them. They said that they had been plucking flowers
<div n="lb"/>to worship Viṣṇu. Naravāhana followed them to the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Viṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu was greatly pleased at
<div n="lb"/>Naravāhanadatta who was standing with folded hands
[Page532-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>singing praises of Viṣṇu in intense devotion and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him to become the emperor of the Vidyādharas.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara).
