ĀḌI¦. A mighty son of the demon, Andhakāsura. He did
<div n="lb"/>penance to please Brahmā and obtained from him a
<div n="lb"/>boon to seek vengeance on Śiva who had murdered his
<div n="lb"/>father. The boon was that Āḍi would die only when he
<div n="lb"/>left his present form and took another form. After
<div n="lb"/>obtaining the boon Āḍi went to Kailāsa and outwitting
<div n="lb"/>the sentries entered the abode of Śiva in the shape of a
<div n="lb"/>serpent. After that he disguised himself as Pārvatī and
<div n="lb"/>went near Śiva. But Śiva knew the trick and killed him.
