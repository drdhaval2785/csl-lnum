ARUṆA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Son of Kaśyapa by Vinatā. Kaśyapa, son
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā, married Vinatā and Kadrū, and being so
<div n="lb"/>much pleased by their services he gave them boons.
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū got the boon to have 1000 nāga (serpent) sons,
<div n="lb"/>and Vinatā to have two sons more powerful and vital
<div n="lb"/>than the sons of Kadrū. After this Kaśyapa went into
<div n="lb"/>the forest again for Tapas. After a period, Kadrū gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to 1000 eggs and Vinatā to two. Both the mothers
<div n="lb"/>kept their eggs in pots so that they were in the right
<div n="lb"/>temperature. After 500 years the pot broke up and
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū had her 1000 sons. Vinatā felt pained at this
<div n="lb"/>and opened one of her pots. A child only half-developed
<div n="lb"/>emerged from the egg and he was Aruṇa. (M.B., Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 16, Verses 5-7). After another 500
<div n="lb"/>years the other egg of Vinatā hatched itself and a glow-
<div n="lb"/>ing son emerged. He was Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} While Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa wandered
<div n="lb"/>in the forest searching for Sītā they saw the wounded
<div n="lb"/>and disabled Jaṭāyu. Jaṭāyu described his genealogy
<div n="lb"/>as follows: “Kaśyapa, son of Brahmā, married the
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa. Of the two wives, Vinatā delivered
<div n="lb"/>two sons, Garuḍa and Aruṇa. Sampāti was Aruṇa's
<div n="lb"/>elder son and he (Jaṭāyu) the younger. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14). Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 19 also refers to Garuḍa and Aruṇa as the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Vinatā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Aruṇa curses his mother.%} The fact of Vinatā forcing
<div n="lb"/>open one of her eggs prematurely and Aruṇa emerging
<div n="lb"/>out of it with only a half-developed body has been
<div n="lb"/>mentioned above. Aruṇa got angry at the haste of his
<div n="lb"/>mother and cursed her to live as slave of Kadrū for
<div n="lb"/>500 years, and then Garuḍa would redeem her from
<div n="lb"/>slavery. He also asked her to wait for 500 years so that
<div n="lb"/>the birth of another physically deficient son like him-
<div n="lb"/>self might be avoided. After pronouncing this curse Aruṇa
[Page055-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>rose to the sky. This curse was the reason for Vinatā's
<div n="lb"/>becoming a slave of Kadrū. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>16, Verses 18-23).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Aruṇa became charioteer of Sun.%} The Sun and the
<div n="lb"/>Moon betrayed to the Devas Rāhu, who waited at the
<div n="lb"/>entrance of Devaloka to snatch off the Nectar (Amṛtam)
<div n="lb"/>got at the churning of the sea of milk (Kṣīrābdhi).
<div n="lb"/>Thenceforth Rāhu does often swallow the Sun and the
<div n="lb"/>Moon. That phenomenon is called the eclipse (of the Sun
<div n="lb"/>or Moon. Sūrya-grahaṇa and Candra-grahaṇa). Enraged
<div n="lb"/>by these frequent attacks of Rāhu, the Sun-God began
<div n="lb"/>once to burn like anything. Murmuring that everyone
<div n="lb"/>would cooperate when there was something to be achiev-
<div n="lb"/>ed, but would go on their own way when the object was
<div n="lb"/>achieved, the Sun-God began burning so virulently as
<div n="lb"/>to destroy all living forms, and the Devas were frighten-
<div n="lb"/>ed by this and took refuge in Brahmā. Brahmā called
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa and asked him to stand as charioteer in front
<div n="lb"/>of the Sun-God everyday so that the Sun's intensity
<div n="lb"/>might be reduced. From that day onwards Aruṇa has
<div n="lb"/>been functioning as the charioteer of the Sun. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 24, Verses 15-20).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Birth of sons.%} Śyenī, wife of Aruṇa delivered two
<div n="lb"/>sons, Sampāti and Jaṭāyu. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>68, Verse 71).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Aruṇa assumed female form.%} Śīlāvatī, the chaste
<div n="lb"/>woman, once did naked Tapas to redeem her husband,
<div n="lb"/>Ugratapas from the consequences of a curse. The object
<div n="lb"/>of her tapas was to prevent the next dawn (Sunrise).
<div n="lb"/>Owing to the intensity of her tapas the Sun ceased to
<div n="lb"/>rise, and this gave his charioteer Aruṇa some rest. Then
<div n="lb"/>it was that Aruṇa came to know of a programme of
<div n="lb"/>naked dance by the women in Devaloka. Women alone
<div n="lb"/>were admitted to the dance hall. Aruṇa, therefore, assum-
<div n="lb"/>ed female form and sat among the Deva women, and
<div n="lb"/>the beautiful ‘female’ kindled erotic sentiments in Indra
<div n="lb"/>and he enjoyed a night with ‘her’. Also, a son was born
<div n="lb"/>to them. And, before the day dawned Aruṇa, at the ins-
<div n="lb"/>tance of Indra entrusted the child to Ahalyādevī and re-
<div n="lb"/>turned to join duty as the Sun-God's charioteer. (Aruṇa,
<div n="lb"/>while he acted as Indra's wife was called Āruṇīdevī).
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa was a bit late to report for duty, and when
<div n="lb"/>questioned by Sun he detailed the happenings during
<div n="lb"/>the last night. This evoked the desire in the Sun to see
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa in female form. Aruṇa did so, and the Sun en-
<div n="lb"/>joyed her. This also resulted in the birth of a son, who
<div n="lb"/>too was, at the instance of the Sun, entrusted to Ahalyā-
<div n="lb"/>devī. Ahalyādevī brought both the children with tender
<div n="lb"/>love, which Gautama muni, her husband did not like.
<div n="lb"/>He cursed them and turned them into monkeys. After
<div n="lb"/>some time Indra went to Ahalyā to see his child and he
<div n="lb"/>was told the story of Gautama's curse. Indra searched
<div n="lb"/>out both the monkeys. In view of the elder one having a
<div n="lb"/>long tail he was called Bāli (Vāli) and the neck of the
<div n="lb"/>second one being very beautiful, he was named Sugrīva.
<div n="lb"/>At that time, Ṛkṣarāja, the monkey King of Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>was very unhappy because he had no sons. He came to
<div n="lb"/>know of Bāli and Sugrīva, and requested Indra to give
<div n="lb"/>both the monkeys to him as sons. Indra gladly obliged
<div n="lb"/>him. Indra blessed Bāli to the effect that half the
<div n="lb"/>strength of anybody who attacked him would be added
<div n="lb"/>to his own natural power. Indra then sent him and
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva to Kiṣkindhā.
