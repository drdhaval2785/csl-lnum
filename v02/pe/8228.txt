VIBHĪṢAṆA I¦. Brother of Rāvaṇa. The son Viśravas
<div n="lb"/>was born to Prajāpati Pulastya. Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Vibhīṣaṇa were born to Viśravas by his wife Mālinī.
<div n="lb"/>A daughter named Śūrpaṇakhā also was born to them.
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa went to do penance under
<div n="lb"/>the leadership of their eldest brother Rāvaṇa. They
<div n="lb"/>did severe penance and obtained various boons. The
<div n="lb"/>boon given to Vibhīṣaṇa was to live as a righteous
<div n="lb"/>man. After that they came back and defeated Kubera,
<div n="lb"/>the ruler of Laṅkā and brought Laṅkā under
<div n="lb"/>their control. Rāvaṇa became the ruler of Laṅkā.
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa lived with their brother
<div n="lb"/>in Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa married Mandodarī. Kumbhakarṇa
<div n="lb"/>took Vajrajvālā the daughter of Mahābali and Vibhī-
<div n="lb"/>ṣaṇa took Saralā, the daughter of Śailūṣa a Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>as their wives, according to Uttara Rāmāyaṇa. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>conquered the three worlds and was ruling as the
<div n="lb"/>emperor of the whole world, when Śrī Rāma and Lakṣ-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa went to the forest, with Sītā. Rāvaṇa carried Sītā
<div n="lb"/>away to Laṅkā. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, with the help
<div n="lb"/>of the monkey-army entered Laṅkā. At this time Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>called together his ministers to consider the details about
<div n="lb"/>the battle with Śrī Rāma. Every one present except
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa voted for the battle. Vibhīṣaṇa advised
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa to return Śītā, the stolen property and beg Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma for pardon. Rāvaṇa got angry and expelled
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa from Laṅkā. Vibhīṣaṇa joined the side of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma and informed him of all the military secrets
<div n="lb"/>of Rāvaṇa. In the battle which ensued Rāvaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>killed and Vibhīṣaṇa was made the king of Laṅkā by
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma. It is stated in Kambarāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa that according to the instruction of Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and at the instance of Indra, Viśvakarmā came to
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā and renovated the city of Laṅkā.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma returned to Ayodhyā and became the king.
<div n="lb"/>One day Candragupta, the second son of Sahasramukha
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa (Rāvaṇa with thousand heads) stole away the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Sugrīva and the daughter-in-law of Vibhī-
[Page846-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>ṣaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa informed Śrī Rāma of this. Śrī Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>with Lakṣmaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, Sugrīva, Hanūmān and
<div n="lb"/>the monkey-army went to the city of Sahasramukha
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa in the middle of Milk-sea. A fierce battle ensued
<div n="lb"/>which lasted for three days. All the Rākṣaṣas were
<div n="lb"/>killed. (See under Sahasramukharāvaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Kamba Rāmāyaṇa that in the horse
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice performed by Śrī Rāma, the control of the
<div n="lb"/>army was in the hands of Sugrīva and financial control
<div n="lb"/>was vested in the hands of Vibhīṣaṇa.
