CATURMUKHALIṄGA¦. A Brahma liṅga installed on
<div n="lb"/>the northern bank of Sarasvatī by Brahmā. Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>to start with, created animate and inanimate objects,
<div n="lb"/>and was thinking about further creation when a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful girl, born of herself appeared before him. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>became enamoured of that girl and showed an unbe-
<div n="lb"/>coming passion. As a punishment for this sin one of his
<div n="lb"/>heads broke. Thus broken-headed Brahmā, went to
<div n="lb"/>the Sthāṇutīrtha, which washes off all sins, on the north-
<div n="lb"/>ern bank of Sarasvatī and installed his own liṅga, known
<div n="lb"/>as the Caturmukhaliṅga. This installation of liṅga
<div n="lb"/>redeemed him from sins. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 49).
