VĪRAṆĪ¦ I (VĪRIṆĪ). A daughter of Brahmā. First,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā created the Saptarṣis (the seven hermits) by
<div n="lb"/>his mind. After this Rudra was born from the anger
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā, Nārada from the lap of Brahmā, Dakṣa from
<div n="lb"/>the thumb of Brahmā, Sanaka and the others from the
<div n="lb"/>mind of Brahmā, and the daughter Vīraṇī from the left
<div n="lb"/>thumb of Brahmā. Dakṣa married this Vīraṇī. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>took rebirth as the son of this couple.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa married Vīraṇī at the behest of Brahmā. At first
<div n="lb"/>this beautiful woman gave birth to five thousand sons.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada misguided them. Dakṣa got angry at this. He
<div n="lb"/>cursed Nārada. Owing to that curse Nārada had to
<div n="lb"/>take birth again as the son of Dakṣa and Vīrani. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
