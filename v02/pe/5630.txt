RĀJYAVARDDHANA¦. A king of Vaiśālī. Rājya-
<div n="lb"/>varddhana was a great ascetic, who could comprehend
<div n="lb"/>the past, the present and the future. Knowing that his
<div n="lb"/>death was near, he told his subjects about it and went
<div n="lb"/>into the forests for tapas.
<div n="NI"/>Sorry over the departure of their king, his subjects as
<div n="lb"/>well as ministers began worshipping Sūrya, who appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed and blessed them saying that their king would live
<div n="lb"/>for ten thousand years in perfect health, victory and
<div n="lb"/>with all wealth and prosperity and other resources and
<div n="lb"/>with unimpaired youthfulness.
<div n="NI"/>The ministers and subjects greatly elated over the boon
<div n="lb"/>informed their king in the forest about it, but he only felt
<div n="lb"/>sorry about it. He told them that during his life for ten
<div n="lb"/>thousands years he would have to witness the death of
<div n="lb"/>his sons, grandsons and subjects and would thus have to
<div n="lb"/>be sad throughout life.
<div n="NI"/>The king consoled and made them return. Then he
<div n="lb"/>did rigorous tapas to Sūrya and secured from him the
<div n="lb"/>boon that during his life-time none would die. (Mār-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
