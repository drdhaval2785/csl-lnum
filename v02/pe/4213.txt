MAINĀKA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A mountain. This mountain was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Himavān and father of Krauñca. (Śloka 13,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 18, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How the mountain helped Hanūmān.%} There is an
<div n="lb"/>unbreakable tie between Maināka and the Kings of
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku family. There is a story in Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa that the sāgara (ocean) was constructed by the
<div n="lb"/>sixty thousand sons of the King Sagara of Ikṣvāku
<div n="lb"/>family. This sāgara once gave refuge to Maināka and
<div n="lb"/>brought it up. There is a reason for that:—
[Page468-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>In the early yugas mountains had wings and they used
<div n="lb"/>to fly and drop to the ground as they liked. People
<div n="lb"/>used to live in fright always and at the request of the
<div n="lb"/>people Indra made the mountains stand in a row and
<div n="lb"/>cut off their wings. At that time the god Vāyu (wind)
<div n="lb"/>took away his friend Maināka and put him in the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. From that day onwards Maināka and the
<div n="lb"/>ocean developed an intimacy which even death could
<div n="lb"/>not wipe off. Hanūmān was the son of Vāyu, the
<div n="lb"/>friend and saviour of Maināka. It was because of that
<div n="lb"/>that Maināka gave refuge for Hanūmān on his way to
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā. Because the ocean gave refuge to Maināka
<div n="lb"/>after its escape from the sword of Indra and because
<div n="lb"/>the ocean (Sāgara) was the creation of the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Sagara, a King of the Ikṣvāku race, Maināka felt
<div n="lb"/>indebted to Sagara and the entire race to which he
<div n="lb"/>belonged. Maināka thus had great respect for Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma who belonged to the Ikṣvāku race. This was
<div n="lb"/>also responsible for Maināka giving relief to Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>on his way to Laṅkā. (See under Parvata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) This mountain is situated near the lake Bindu-
<div n="lb"/>sarovara which was to the north of Kailāsa. Bhagīratha
<div n="lb"/>did penance to bring Gaṅgā to the earth on this
<div n="lb"/>mountain. (Chapter 3, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Pāṇḍavas who went to the north crossed the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Maināka and went further. (Śloka 1,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 139, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The mountain Maināka shines with golden
<div n="lb"/>peaks. (Śloka 44, Chapter 145, Vana Parva).
