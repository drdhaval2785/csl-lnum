KĪCAKA¦. Brother-in-law of Mātsya, king of Virāṭa and
<div n="lb"/>son of Kekaya, king of the Sūtas.
[Page411-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} To Kekaya, king of the Sūtas
<div n="lb"/>was born of queen Mālavī, Kīcaka and other 105 sons
<div n="lb"/>younger to him called Upa-Kīcakas. Their only sister
<div n="lb"/>was called Sudeṣṇā, (Bhārata, Southern text, Page
<div n="lb"/>1898). Kīcaka and Upa-Kīcakas took their birth from
<div n="lb"/>an aspect of Bāṇa, the eldest of the Asuras known as
<div n="lb"/>the Kālakeyas. (See Bhārata, Page 1893). Mātsya, the
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa king wedded Sudeṣṇā; and from that day on-
<div n="lb"/>wards, the brothers too lived in the Virāṭa palace. Kīcaka
<div n="lb"/>was the chieftain of Virāṭa's army, and he had, many a
<div n="lb"/>time, defeated in war King Suśarman of Trigarta.
<div n="lb"/>(Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 30).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kīcaka and Pāñcālī.%} During their life incognito,
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas lived in the Virāṭa palace after taking
<div n="lb"/>up various jobs. Pāñcāli, under the assumed name
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī, served Sudeṣṇā and her daughter Uttarā as
<div n="lb"/>their chaperon. Kīcaka fell in love with Pāñcālī at
<div n="lb"/>first sight. But, Pāñcālī resisted all his advances. Then,
<div n="lb"/>he sought the help of his sister Sudeṣṇā to bring round
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī to him somehow. Sudeṣṇā asked Kīcaka to be
<div n="lb"/>ready on the New Moon day with liquor and rice and
<div n="lb"/>promised to send Mālinī (Pāñcālī) to him. Ordered
<div n="lb"/>by Sudeṣṇā, she went to Kīcaka with his plate of food
<div n="lb"/>much against her will. Kīcaka caught hold of her, but
<div n="lb"/>she ran when the former caught her by the hair, felled
<div n="lb"/>her on the floor and kicked her. A Rākṣasa, who was
<div n="lb"/>deputed for Pāñcālī's security appeared on the scene in
<div n="lb"/>a trice and felled Kīcaka.
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kīcaka's Death.%} The very same night with tears in
<div n="lb"/>her eyes, Pāñcālī told Bhīma all about the indecent
<div n="lb"/>behaviour. He asked Pāñcālī to invite Kīcaka to a
<div n="lb"/>secret meeting at a specified place the next night, and
<div n="lb"/>promised her that he would remain concealed there
<div n="lb"/>and kill Kīcaka. Accordingly Bhīma concealed himself
<div n="lb"/>the next night in the dancing hall and, as requested by
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī, Kīcaka came to the hall at midnight to spend
<div n="lb"/>a few hours with Pāñcālī. Bhīma was lying there on
<div n="lb"/>a cot, and Kīcaka, mistaking him for Pāñcālī kissed
<div n="lb"/>him. Bhīma caught him in his iron grips and crushed him
<div n="lb"/>to death. The next morning, it was the fate of Kīcaka's
<div n="lb"/>brothers to lament over his death. The story also was
<div n="lb"/>spread that Kīcaka was killed by some Gandharva, the
<div n="lb"/>husband of Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>The Upa-Kīcakas removed the dead body of their
<div n="lb"/>brother to the burning ghat. Proclaiming that Pāñcālī,
<div n="lb"/>who was responsible for the death of their brother
<div n="lb"/>would also be burnt to death on the same pyre, the
<div n="lb"/>Upa-Kīcakas forcibly took her with them. Hearing the
<div n="lb"/>heart-rending cries of Pāñcālī Bhīma rushed to the spot
<div n="lb"/>and killed all the Upa-Kīcakas and saved Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>from death. In the presence of the Virāṭa king the
<div n="lb"/>cremation of Kīcaka and the Upa-Kīcakas took place.
<div n="lb"/>(Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 13 et seq).
