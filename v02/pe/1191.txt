BHŪLIṄGA¦(M). A bird which lived on the opposite
<div n="lb"/>side of the Himālayas. The cry of this bird resembles
<div n="lb"/>“MĀ SĀHASA”.
<F>1) Mā Sāhasa = Do not act rashly.</F> But this bird lived by pecking at
<div n="lb"/>and eating the flesh between the teeth of a lion. Śiśupāla
<div n="lb"/>mentioned this bird as an example to illustrate that
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma's advice was at variance with his practice.
<div n="lb"/>The bird exhorts people not to act in a rash way (Mā
<div n="lb"/>Sāhasa) and at the same time acts rashly.
