MAYA¦. A Dānava king who served Devas and Asuras
<div n="lb"/>as their architect and builder.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Kaśyapa Prajāpati, son of Marīci and
<div n="lb"/>grandson of Brahmā married the thirteen daughters of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa. Among them, the first was Aditi, the second
<div n="lb"/>was Diti and the third was Danu. Āditeyas were born
<div n="lb"/>to Aditi, Daityas were born to Diti and Dānavas were
<div n="lb"/>born to Danu. The chief among the sons of Danu
<div n="lb"/>was Maya.
<div n="NI"/>Maya was found to be very proficient in the art of archi-
<div n="lb"/>tecture even from his boyhood. He worshipped Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>in the Himālayas to gain unrivalled skill in architecture
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was pleased and appeared before him. He
<div n="lb"/>blessed Maya to become the unequalled architect of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas. Asuras and Dānavas. After that Maya was en-
<div n="lb"/>gaged in building magnificent mansions for Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras. He was also anointed King of the Dānavas.
<div n="NI"/>It was a period of friendly co-operation and brotherly
<div n="lb"/>relations between Devas and Asuras. Once there was a
<div n="lb"/>dancing show in Devaloka. Maya was also invited to
<div n="lb"/>see the performance of the women of Devaloka. All the
<div n="lb"/>dancers acquitted themselves creditably. But what
<div n="lb"/>attracted Maya most, was the dance of Hemā, the
<div n="lb"/>Apsarā woman. Maya and Hemā were mutually
<div n="lb"/>attracted and fell in love with each other. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>who came to know of this, gave Hemā in marriage to
<div n="lb"/>Maya. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Domestic life.%} Maya and Hemā went to the valley
<div n="lb"/>south of Himavān and built there a city named “Hema-
<div n="lb"/>pura”. While leading a happy life there, two sons,
<div n="lb"/>Māyāvī and Dundubhi were born to them. But they had
<div n="lb"/>no daughter. So they worshipped Śiva, praying for a
<div n="lb"/>daughter.
<div n="NI"/>At about that time, one day, an Apsarā woman,
<div n="lb"/>Madhurā, after observing Somavāra Vrata, came to
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and did obeisance to him. Pārvatī was not at home
<div n="lb"/>at the moment. Fascinated by Madhurā's charm, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>embraced her. Pārvatī who came to know of it, cursed
[Page495-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Madhurā and turned her into a frog. But she said that
<div n="lb"/>after twelve years, the curse would be lifted and she
<div n="lb"/>would become a woman again. It was in a well near
<div n="lb"/>the place where Maya and Hemā were performing tapas
<div n="lb"/>that Madhurā fell as frog. After twelve years, the frog
<div n="lb"/>recovered her former shape as a woman. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Maya saw her, and taking her to be the daughter
<div n="lb"/>given to him by Śiva, took her with him to his palace.
<div n="lb"/>He gave her the name “Mandodarī”. It was this
<div n="lb"/>“Mandodarī” whom Rāvaṇa married later.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these three children, Maya had some other
<div n="lb"/>sons and daughters. In Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha
<div n="lb"/>there is a reference to the Dānava named Bala, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Maya, living in Atala, a section of Pātāla. In Kathā
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, 3rd Taraṅga we
<div n="lb"/>find that Maya had two daughters named Svayam-
<div n="lb"/>prabhā and Somaprabhā. Of them, Somaprabhā was
<div n="lb"/>married by Nalakūbara, the son of Vaiśravaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Alliance with Arjuna and construction of Indraprastha.%}
<div n="lb"/>Once Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna offered Khāṇḍavavana to Agni-
<div n="lb"/>deva as a feast. (See under the word “Khāṇḍavadāha”).
<div n="lb"/>While Agni was furiously feeding upon the forests, the
<div n="lb"/>human and animal inhabitants in it began to flee from
<div n="lb"/>it. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna shot them down with arrows. At
<div n="lb"/>that time Maya was hiding himself in the disguise of
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka. When the flames of fire approached that place
<div n="lb"/>Maya left his shelter and rushed out. Śrī Kṛṣṇa aimed
<div n="lb"/>his weapon Cakra at him. Crying aloud with fear,
<div n="lb"/>Maya ran to Arjuna praying for protection. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>stopped Agnideva and Śrī Kṛṣṇa and thus saved Maya.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 240).
<div n="NI"/>From that time, Maya became a loyal follower of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. After Khāṇḍavadāha, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were
<div n="lb"/>taking rest when Maya approached them with joined
<div n="lb"/>palms and asked Arjuna what he should do in return
<div n="lb"/>for saving him from the fury of Kṛṣṇa and the blazing
<div n="lb"/>fire. Arjuna replied that he expected no return from
<div n="lb"/>Maya for saving his life but wanted only his friend-
<div n="lb"/>ship. Maya was not satisfied. He insisted that Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>should accept some service from him as a token of his
<div n="lb"/>deep gratitude. On hearing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa suggested
<div n="lb"/>that Maya should build a beautiful palace for
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. Accordingly he built a magnificent
<div n="lb"/>palace for the Pāṇḍavas at the place called Khāṇḍava-
<div n="lb"/>prastha. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Maya settled down in Vindhya.%} Once Maya sought
<div n="lb"/>shelter from Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu offered shelter to Maya
<div n="lb"/>and so he built a mansion called “Sudharmā” for all
<div n="lb"/>the Devas. It was a building of inexpressible beauty and
<div n="lb"/>rare architectural workmanship. The Asuras who
<div n="lb"/>became angry with Maya for his alliance with the Devas
<div n="lb"/>made preparations to attack him. Alarmed at it, Maya
<div n="lb"/>fled southwards with his family and reached Vindhya.
<div n="lb"/>There he built a lovely mansion and settled down in it.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāśaritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, 3rd
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā kāṇḍa, 50th sarga
<div n="lb"/>also there is a reference to this wonderful mansion
<div n="lb"/>which Maya built on the Vindhya mountain. In their
<div n="lb"/>search for Sītā, Hanūmān and the other monkeys
<div n="lb"/>reached the Vindhya mountain. There they combed the
<div n="lb"/>forests and caves to find out Sītā. When they caṃe to
<div n="lb"/>the peak to the south west of the mountain, they saw a
<div n="lb"/>huge dark cave. They entered it and cautiously moved
<div n="lb"/>forward. After a long and tedious walk the monkeys
[Page495-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>were exhausted with hunger and thirst. When they
<div n="lb"/>proceeded a little further, they came across a bright
<div n="lb"/>place. There they saw a woman sitting alone, dressed
<div n="lb"/>in deer skin and barks of trees. She greeted them and
<div n="lb"/>in the course of her talk with the monkeys she told
<div n="lb"/>them that the cave was made by the magician Maya
<div n="lb"/>and that her name was Svayamprabhā. Her mother was
<div n="lb"/>Merusāvarṇī and that she (Svayamprabhā) was entrust-
<div n="lb"/>ed with the task guarding the wonderful mansion.
<div n="lb"/>Then she gave them fruits and fresh water.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Building of Tripuras.%} It was Maya who built three
<div n="lb"/>magic dwellings for the three Dānavas, Kamalākṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Tārakākṣa and Vidyunmālī. (For details see under the
<div n="lb"/>word Pura).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 227, Verse 41
<div n="lb"/>says that Namuci the Dānava was the brother of Maya.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Maya had two sons named Sunītha and Sudaṇḍika
<div n="lb"/>They became human beings under a curse. (For details
<div n="lb"/>see under the word Sūryaprabhā).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In Kathāsaritsāgara Madanamañcukālambaka,
<div n="lb"/>8th Taraṅga we see that Maya was an incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) At the time when Mahāviṣṇu as Vāmana took the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds from Mahābali, Maya joined with other
<div n="lb"/>Dānavas and fought against Vāmana. (M.B. Bhaviṣya
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 55).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Maya was relaxing with his friends on the
<div n="lb"/>Malaya mountain. Knowing about it Maheśvara sent
<div n="lb"/>Indra to that mountain. Indra challenged the Dānavas
<div n="lb"/>for a fight. In the battle that followed, Indra killed the
<div n="lb"/>Dānava named Pāka. Thus he got the name, “Pāka-
<div n="lb"/>śāsana”. Indra killed Pura, the son of Mahābali also in
<div n="lb"/>that battle and so came to be known as “Purandara”
<div n="lb"/>The remaining Dānavas under the leadership of Maya
<div n="lb"/>fled to Pātāla. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 71).
