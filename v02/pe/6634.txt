ŚIŚUMĀRA I¦. A Ṛṣi. This Ṛṣi used to live in water in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a crocodile. There is a story about him in
<div n="lb"/>the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once all the Ṛṣis joined together in praising Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Śiśumāra alone remained silent without taking part in
<div n="lb"/>it. Seeing this, Devendra ordered Śiśumāra to praise
<div n="lb"/>him. The sage answered proudly that he had no time
<div n="lb"/>for it and that he would praise Indra for as much time
<div n="lb"/>as was needed to throw the water upwards.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly he started praising Indra. The sage to
<div n="lb"/>whom Indra's praise was at first disagreeable, subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently felt that he could not do it too much. By his
<div n="lb"/>austerity he acquired “Sāmavidyā”. He even compos-
<div n="lb"/>ed a “Sāma” (a hymn) in praise of Indra. In later
<div n="lb"/>times it became famous as “Śārkarasāma”.
