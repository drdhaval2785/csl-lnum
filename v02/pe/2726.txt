IDHMAVĀHA¦. Son of Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā.
<div n="lb"/>The actual name of Idhmavāha was Tridasyu. There is
<div n="lb"/>a story in the Mahābhārata about the birth of this boy.
<div n="lb"/>When Lopāmudrā was pregnant, Agastya asked her:—
<div n="lb"/>“1000 sons of average ability; or 100 sons, each of them
<div n="lb"/>having the worth of 10 sons; or 10 sons, each having the
<div n="lb"/>worth of 100 sons; or a single son having the nobility
<div n="lb"/>and greatness of more than a thousand sons; which
<div n="lb"/>would you prefer?” Lopāmudrā chose a single son with
<div n="lb"/>the greatness of a thousand sons. Tridasyu or Idhmavāha
<div n="lb"/>was the son born according to her wish. The child was
<div n="lb"/>in the womb for seven years before he was born. He
<div n="lb"/>began to recite Vedas even from the moment of his
<div n="lb"/>birth. As the boy grew up, he used to bring small pieces
<div n="lb"/>of firewoods and twigs to feed the fire for his father's
<div n="lb"/>homa. That was why he got the name Idhmavāha.
<div n="lb"/>(One who brings the necessary things for homa).
<div n="lb"/>(Idhma=fuel; vāha=one who carries).
