ṚṢABHA II¦. A muni (sage) who was the grandson of
<div n="lb"/>King Agnīdhra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%}
<div n="NI"/>Ṛṣabha was the son of King Nābhi by his wife Meru-
<div n="lb"/>devī. One hundred sons were born to Ṛṣabha by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Jayantī. After entrusting his kingdom to Bharata,
<div n="lb"/>the eldest of his sons, Ṛṣabha went to the forest and
<div n="lb"/>did tapas in Pulaha's āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ṛṣabha and Ṛṣabhakūṭa%} Ṛṣabha did tapas in the
<div n="lb"/>forest for many years. The mountain peak on which
<div n="lb"/>he performed his tapas got the name “Ṛṣabhakūṭa”.
<div n="lb"/>The sage who wished to observe strict silence did not
<div n="lb"/>like the presence of strangers and visitors in the vicinity.
<div n="lb"/>So he pronounced a curse that the mountain should
<div n="lb"/>drop boulders on any one who ventured to come there.
<div n="lb"/>Once he ordered the wind to blow without noise as it
<div n="lb"/>passed by the side of the mountain. He declared that
<div n="lb"/>anyone who made noise in Ṛṣabhakūṭa would be
<div n="lb"/>struck with thunder. A place of holy waters came into
<div n="lb"/>existence there. (M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The power of Ṛṣabha's Yāga.%} Ṛṣabha became a
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Śiva by worshipping him.
<div n="NI"/>Once a Brāhmaṇa named Mandara had an illicit
<div n="lb"/>alliance with Piṅgalā, a prostitute. Both of them died
<div n="lb"/>together. Mandara was re-born as Bhadrāyu, the
<div n="lb"/>grandson of Nala and Piṅgalā as Sumati, the wife of
<div n="lb"/>King Vajrabāhu (Aṃśumān). Sumati became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>Her co-wives who were jealous of her poisoned her.
<div n="lb"/>As a result of it, she and the child born to her fell
<div n="lb"/>victims to diseases. Daśārṇa abandoned them in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Sumati lived in the house of a Vaiśya with her
<div n="lb"/>child. While living there, the child died of disease. Ṛṣa-
[Page651-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>bha went to the grief-stricken Sumati and comforted her.
<div n="lb"/>(Śiva Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ṛṣabha's End.%} Ṛṣabha performed tapas according to
<div n="lb"/>the rules of Vānaprastha āśrama and conducted yāgas
<div n="lb"/>as ordained by Śāstras. On account of his austerity he
<div n="lb"/>became so lean and thin that all the veins in the body
<div n="lb"/>could be seen. Putting a pebble in his mouth, he went
<div n="lb"/>about in the forest, determined to renounce his body.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Chapter 1, Section 1).
<div n="NI"/>In the course of his wanderings in the forest a wild fire
<div n="lb"/>broke out in which his body was burnt up. Śiva Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>says that the soul of Ṛṣabha who died in the wild fire,
<div n="lb"/>attained Śiva Loka.
