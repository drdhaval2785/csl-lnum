ṚGVEDA¦. The Ṛgveda is the oldest recorded work of
<div n="lb"/>the human race. The Egyptians claim that another book
<div n="lb"/>entitled “Book of the Dead” was also written during the
<div n="lb"/>period of the Ṛgveda. The Babylonians have an ancient
<div n="lb"/>work called ‘Gilgamish’, which according to scholars, is
<div n="lb"/>not as old as the Ṛgveda. Ṛgveda is the work that forms
<div n="lb"/>the basis of Hindu religion. Of the four Vedas, Yajur-
<div n="lb"/>veda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda were composed
<div n="lb"/>after Ṛgveda.” The Ṛgveda sūktas were interpreted for
<div n="lb"/>the first time in Yāska's “Nirukta” and Sāyaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>“Vedārthaprakāśa”.
<div n="NI"/>The most important of the four Vedas is Ṛgveda. It
<div n="lb"/>is divided into ten “Maṇḍalas”. There are 1017 sūktas
<div n="lb"/>and 10472 Ṛks in it. Although there are 11 more
<div n="lb"/>Sūktas called “khilas,” they are not usually included in
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>Maṇḍalas two to seven of the Ṛgveda were composed in
<div n="lb"/>different Ṛṣikulas. The second Maṇḍala was of
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgava Kula, the third of Viśvāmitrakula, the fourth
<div n="lb"/>of Vāmadeva, the fifth of Atri, the sixth of Bharadvāja
<div n="lb"/>and the seventh of Vasiṣṭha. The eighth Maṇḍala and the
<div n="lb"/>first 50 Sūktas of the first Maṇḍala were composed by
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇvakula. The general view is that the tenth Maṇḍala
<div n="lb"/>was written by someone at a later period.
<div n="NI"/>Most of the Ṛgveda sūktas are praises. But some of the
<div n="lb"/>Sūktas in the tenth Maṇḍala are of a different type.
<div n="lb"/>We can see in many sūktas the joy and wonder
<div n="lb"/>experienced by the Āryas when they entered the beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful land of India for the first time. Most scholars believe
<div n="lb"/>that the Ṛgveda was composed during the period
<div n="lb"/>between 2,500 and 2,000 B.C.

<div n="NI"/>{%Ancient Belief about Ṛgveda.%} The four Vedas—Ṛgveda,
<div n="lb"/>Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda emerged from
<div n="lb"/>the four faces of Brahmā. In Kṛtayuga, Brahmā gave
<div n="lb"/>these Vedas to his sons. In Dvāparayuga, the Ṛṣis got
<div n="lb"/>these Vedas. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated on earth for the
<div n="lb"/>preservation of Dharma, in the person of Veda Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa distributed the Vedas among his son Śākalya and
<div n="lb"/>his disciples. Śākalya received Ṛgveda. He com-
<div n="lb"/>municated it to his disciples. (Bhāgavata, 12th Skan-
<div n="lb"/>dha. See under the word Veda).
