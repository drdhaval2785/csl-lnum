<div n="NI"/>(i) Ekata, Dvita and Trita were born to clean the
<div n="lb"/>hands of the devas when they become smeared with

<div n="lb"/>to his brothers. The cruel brothers, after drinking the
<div n="lb"/>water pushed Trita into the well and covered the well
<div n="lb"/>with the wheel of a bullock-cart. Trita prayed to the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas for help and they appeared before him
<div n="lb"/>and rescued him from the well. (Sūkta 105, Maṇḍala 1,
