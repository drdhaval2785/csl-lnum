KERALA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A small country lying in the
<div n="lb"/>south-west corner of India. From the Purāṇas it
<div n="lb"/>could be understood that this country lying to the
<div n="lb"/>south of Gokarṇa upto Cape Comorin and to the
[Page403-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>west of Western Ghats had a very ancient history and
<div n="lb"/>civilization of its own.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of Kerala.%} There are two statements, slightly
<div n="lb"/>different from each other, in the Purāṇas, about the
<div n="lb"/>origin of Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>(1) For performing the funeral ceremony of the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Sagara whose ashes were lying in Pātāla (Nether
<div n="lb"/>world), Bhagīratha performed penance and brought
<div n="lb"/>the heavenly river Gaṅgā to the earth. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā). The river fell in North India and flowed in
<div n="lb"/>torrents to the sea and the surrounding regions were
<div n="lb"/>submerged in water. Among the places submerged,
<div n="lb"/>there was the important holy place and Bath of
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa also, lying on the west coast of India. Those
<div n="lb"/>hermits who lived in the vicinity of the temple at
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa, escaped from the flood and went to Mahendra-
<div n="lb"/>giri and informed Paraśurāma of the calamity of the
<div n="lb"/>flood. Paraśurāma went with them to the sea-shore.
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa did not make his appearance. The angry
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma stood in deep meditation for a little
<div n="lb"/>while. The weapons came to his hands. Varuṇa was
<div n="lb"/>filled with fear and he instantly appeared before
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma, who asked him to release the land
<div n="lb"/>swallowed by the sea. Varuṇa agreed. Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>sent his bow and arrow back to the sky. Then he took
<div n="lb"/>a winnowing basket (Śūrpa) and threw it at the sea.
<div n="lb"/>The sea retreated from the place up to the spot where
<div n="lb"/>the winnowing basket fell, and the portion of land
<div n="lb"/>including Gokarṇa which had been swallowed by sea was
<div n="lb"/>recovered. This land is called Kerala, which is known
<div n="lb"/>by the name ‘Śūrpāraka’ also. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 98 and 99).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Paraśurāma went round the world eighteen
<div n="lb"/>times and killed all the Kṣatriya Kings. After that he
<div n="lb"/>performed the sacrifice of Aśvamedha (horse sacrifice).
<div n="lb"/>In the sacrifice he gave all the lands as alms to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins. Kaśyapa received all the lands for the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins. After that he requested Paraśurāma to
<div n="lb"/>vacate the land. Accordingly Paraśurāma created
<div n="lb"/>new land by shooting an arrow at the sea, for
<div n="lb"/>his own use. “At the words of Kaśyapa, he made the
<div n="lb"/>sea retreat by shooting an arrow, thereby creating dry
<div n="lb"/>land.” This land was Kerala. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 70).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kerala and Pātāla (Nether world).%} The ancient
<div n="lb"/>sages of the Purāṇas have grouped the worlds into
<div n="lb"/>three, the Svarga (heaven), Bhūmi (the earth) and
<div n="lb"/>the Pātāla (the nether world). The three worlds taken
<div n="lb"/>as a whole were divided into fourteen worlds. It does
<div n="lb"/>not appear that this grouping was merely imaginary.
<div n="lb"/>A keen observation of the Purāṇas would lead one to
<div n="lb"/>infer that the Himālayan plateau was considered as
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka-Svarga (heaven), the planes between the
<div n="lb"/>Himālaya and the Vindhya as Bhūloka (the earth)
<div n="lb"/>and the regions to the south of the Vindhya as Pātāla
<div n="lb"/>(the nether world), by the ancient people of India.
<div n="lb"/>The seven worlds of Pātāla such as Atala, Vitala,
<div n="lb"/>Sutala, Talātala, Mahātala, Rasātala and Pātāla might
<div n="lb"/>have been seven countries in this region. The following
<div n="lb"/>description which occurs in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8,
<div n="lb"/>would substantiate this inference.
<div n="NI"/>“Pātāla is below the earth. This Pātāla is a group of
<div n="lb"/>seven worlds one below the other, with names, Atala,
<div n="lb"/>Vitala, Sutala, Talātala, Rasātala and Mahātala. In
<div n="lb"/>all those worlds, there are several beautiful cities and
[Page404-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>houses, palaces and castles, parks, gardens, open temples
<div n="lb"/>and halls, natural arbours etc. made by Maya. There
<div n="lb"/>live the Asuras, the Dānavas (a class of Asuras-demons)
<div n="lb"/>the nāgas (serpents) and others, with their families,
<div n="lb"/>with happiness and comfort. Chirping birds, pigeons,
<div n="lb"/>parrots, docile parrots etc. always play there with their
<div n="lb"/>inseparable mates. Trees bearing sweet fruits, plants
<div n="lb"/>covered with fragrant flowers, arbours with creepers
<div n="lb"/>growing thick, beautiful houses floored with white
<div n="lb"/>marble, and so many other things giving pleasure and
<div n="lb"/>comfort are seen there in plenty. In these things the
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla surpasses heaven. Daityas, Dānavas and the
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas (the Asuras and the serpents) are the dwellers
<div n="lb"/>of these worlds. They lead a happy and pleasant life with
<div n="lb"/>their families enjoying all sorts of comfort and luxury.”
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla, one of the seven divisions of the world is describ-
<div n="lb"/>ed as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“This is the region of the Nāgas (the serpents). At the
<div n="lb"/>root-place of this region there is a particular place
<div n="lb"/>having an area of thirty thousand yojanas. Viṣṇu Kalā
<div n="lb"/>who has the attribute of ‘tāmasa’ (darkness) lives there
<div n="lb"/>under the name ‘Ananta’. The real Ananta or Ādiśeṣa
<div n="lb"/>is the radiant embodiment of this Kalā. The daughters
<div n="lb"/>of the Nāga Kings are of fair complexion and very
<div n="lb"/>beautiful, with clean body. They use perfumeries such
<div n="lb"/>as sandalwood, aloewood, saffron, etc.”
<div n="NI"/>In this description, the words Daityas, Nāgas, Ananta,
<div n="lb"/>Sandalwood, aloewood etc. and the mention of natural
<div n="lb"/>beauty should be paid particular attention to. From
<div n="lb"/>the Rāmāyaṇa we can understand that the Āryas refer-
<div n="lb"/>red to the Drāviḍas as Asuras, Rākṣasas (Giants) etc.
<div n="lb"/>History says that the Nāgas were the early inhabitants
<div n="lb"/>of Kerala. The ancient word ‘Ananta’ denotes Tri-
<div n="lb"/>vandrum (Tiru-Ananta-puram). The temple of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Padmanābha at Trivandrum answers to this descrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion. The perfumeries such as sandalwood, aloewood
<div n="lb"/>(cidar) etc. are the wealth of Kerala. On the whole the
<div n="lb"/>description of Pātāla fits well with that of Kerala. So
<div n="lb"/>it is not wrong to infer that the description of Pātāla
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas is entirely about Kerala in all its
<div n="lb"/>aspects.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Primitiveness of Kerala.%} From the portions of
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas given below it could be ascertained that
<div n="lb"/>Kerala had an independence of its own from the very
<div n="lb"/>ancient days.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Among the Kings who attended the Svayaṃvara
<div n="lb"/>(marriage) of Śaśikalā, the daughter of the King of
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī, such as, the King of Kuru, King of Mādra, King
<div n="lb"/>of Sindhu, King of Pāñcāla, Kings of Karṇāṭaka, Cola
<div n="lb"/>and Vidarbha, there was the King of Kerala also. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 3).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When describing the various places in the Southern
<div n="lb"/>part of Bhārata, names such as Dramiḍa, Kerala,
<div n="lb"/>Mūṣika, Karṇāṭaka etc. occur in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>So it is to be understood that when Vyāsa wrote
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata, there was the kingdom of Kerala and that it
<div n="lb"/>was separate from the country of Drāviḍa. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9).
<div n="NI"/>(3) “Kārtavīryārjuna took his majestic seat in the
<div n="lb"/>midst of Cola, Kerala, Pāṇḍya and other Kings of the
<div n="lb"/>countries under the sea, who were standing round him
<div n="lb"/>to pay homage to him.” (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>54).
<div n="NI"/>(4) It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 277, that
<div n="lb"/>a King named Gāndhāra was born in the dynasty
[Page404-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of Turvasu the brother of Yadu, and that from Gān-
<div n="lb"/>dhāra were born the powerful families of the Gāndhāras
<div n="lb"/>the Keralas, the Colas, the Pāṇḍyas and the Kolas.
<div n="NI"/>(5) In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 175, it is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned that the people of Kerala were considered as
<div n="lb"/>barbarians by the North Indians.
<div n="NI"/>(6) In Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, it is mentioned that the
<div n="lb"/>Kings of Cola, Pāṇḍya and Kerala, from South India,
<div n="lb"/>had reached the capital city of Vidarbha to take part
<div n="lb"/>in the Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Rukmiṇī.
<div n="NI"/>(7) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 254, Stanza 15, that in his conquest of the
<div n="lb"/>countries, Karṇa had conquered Kerala also.
<div n="NI"/>(8) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 31, that Sahadeva, one of the Pāṇḍavas, con-
<div n="lb"/>quered the Keralas and the Kerakas. It may be noted
<div n="lb"/>that the Kerakas are different from Keralas.
<div n="NI"/>(9) Vālmīki mentions the countries which could be
<div n="lb"/>seen by the monkeys who were sent to the South by
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva to search for Sītā.
<Poem>Nadīṃ Godāvarīṃ caiva
<div n="lb"/>Sarvamevānupaśyata /
<div n="lb"/>Tathaivāndhrān ca Pauṇḍrān ca
<div n="lb"/>Colān Pāṇḍyān ca Keralān. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>“You could see the river Godāvarī and beyond it the
<div n="lb"/>countries of Āndhra, Pauṇḍra, Cola, Pāṇḍya and
<div n="lb"/>Kerala.”
<div n="NI"/>This is a proof of the primitiveness of Kerala.
<div n="lb"/>(10) The King of Kerala had given Yudhiṣṭhira, as
<div n="lb"/>presents, sandalwood, pearls. Lapis Lazuli etc. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 51).
<div n="lb"/>In several other Purāṇas also, mention about Kerala
<div n="lb"/>occurs.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The ancient administration of Kerala.%} Parimelazhakar,
<div n="lb"/>a Saṅga poet who was a great expounder of “Tirukku-
<div n="lb"/>ral”, has stated that from the beginning of the world
<div n="lb"/>the three kingdoms, Cera, Cola and Pāṇḍya had existed.
<div n="lb"/>Though there is a bit of exaggeration in this statement,
<div n="lb"/>there are enough proofs to say that a long time before
<div n="lb"/>the birth of Christ, Kerala was under a systematic rule.
<div n="lb"/>In ‘Tolkāppiyam’ the first grammatical work in Tamil
<div n="lb"/>mention is made about the administration of Kerala.
<div n="lb"/>Megasthenes, a traveller of 4th century B.C. has stated
<div n="lb"/>about the rule of Kerala:
<div n="NI"/>There were five councils called the Pañcamahāsabhās
<div n="lb"/>(the five great councils) to help the Cera Kings.
<div n="lb"/>It is stated that these councils were formed by the King
<div n="lb"/>Utiyan Cera of the Tṛkkaṇā fort. Besides these five
<div n="lb"/>councils there was an advisory Committee, of which, the
<div n="lb"/>priest of the King, the Chief Minister, Chief of the spies
<div n="lb"/>and the Chief Revenue officer (Kāviṭi) were members.
<div n="lb"/>For convenience of administration the country was
<div n="lb"/>divided into tarakkūṭṭas (groups of houses—villages) and
<div n="lb"/>and Nāṭṭukkūṭṭas (Districts—group of villages). Taras
<div n="lb"/>(villages) were ruled by four elders (Kāraṇavas). Four
<div n="lb"/>villages formed a Nālpāḍu (group) of four. Four Nāl-
<div n="lb"/>pādus formed a Kazhaka (a division of the country with
<div n="lb"/>a chief temple within it) and four Kazhakas formed a
<div n="lb"/>Peruṃkazhaka (greater Kazhaka). Peruṃkazhaka was
<div n="lb"/>also known as Tṛkkala. The assembly hall of tṛk-
<div n="lb"/>kūṭṭa is called Koṭṭil. This hall was erected generally
<div n="lb"/>beside the temple. The chief officer of the temple
<div n="lb"/>was the chairman of the tṛkkūṭṭa (assembly of
<div n="lb"/>the people). When a tṛkkūṭṭa is assembled, sixty-four
<div n="lb"/>elders of the “taras”, the “accas” (officers) of Kazhakas,
[Page405-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the sixty-four Taṇḍāns and sixteen Nālpādies had to be
<div n="lb"/>present. The Nālpādies were the chiefs of four taras.
<div n="lb"/>The accas, who were the Presidents, had to come clad
<div n="lb"/>in variegated silk, with waist-band of long cloth and
<div n="lb"/>wearing a small sword (Churikā). Till recently the
<div n="lb"/>Kazhakas of Aṇḍallūr, Rāmpallya, Kurvantaṭṭa, Turutti
<div n="lb"/>etc., and so many Nālpādus and taras and the elders
<div n="lb"/>thereof had been retaining and enjoying titles and
<div n="lb"/>distinctions of rank.
<div n="NI"/>The Namboothiris (Brahmins) entered Kerala before
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of the Malayāla Era. With that, changes
<div n="lb"/>took place in the administration of Kerala. Certain
<div n="lb"/>edicts help us to ascertain the changes that took place
<div n="lb"/>in the administration. The edict of Vāzhappally of the
<div n="lb"/>9th century by Rājaśekhara is an important one in
<div n="lb"/>this connection. This emperor of the Ceras who is consi-
<div n="lb"/>dered to be a contemporary of Śrī Śaṅkarācārya had
<div n="lb"/>the title beginning with “Rājādhirāja Parameśvara
<div n="lb"/>Bhaṭṭāraka”. (T.A.S. Vol. II, P. 8-14). The subject
<div n="lb"/>dealt with in the edict is the ‘daily worship and settle-
<div n="lb"/>ment’, in the temple of Tiruvoṭṭiyūr. It is stated in this
<div n="lb"/>edict that the people of Vāzhappally and the representa-
<div n="lb"/>tives of 18 Nādus or divisions had met in the temple
<div n="lb"/>and taken certain decisions.
<div n="NI"/>The next one is the Kottayam Copper edicts known as
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Tarisa Church Edicts.’ This is a document granting
<div n="lb"/>the Tarisa Church in Quilon, the adjoining lands and
<div n="lb"/>some other institutions. This edict was granted by
<div n="lb"/>Ayyanaṭi tiruvaṭikal the ruler of the Nāṭu (division),
<div n="lb"/>for the Cera emperor. It is mentioned as “including
<div n="lb"/>the Temple Officer Vijayarākatevar”, which means
<div n="lb"/>that Vijayarāka had been present on the occasion of
<div n="lb"/>granting the edict, as the representative of Emperor
<div n="lb"/>Sthāṇuravi. The Nāḍuvāzhis (local chiefs or rulers of
<div n="lb"/>division) were not empowered to take decision in very
<div n="lb"/>important matters. Titles, rights distinctions of rank
<div n="lb"/>etc. were granted by a council of Chief minister,
<div n="lb"/>Officers, Punnattalappati and Polakkūṭippati (two
<div n="lb"/>high officials). Vijayarākatevar, the Koil adhikāri,
<div n="lb"/>was the representative of the emperor at Mahodaya-
<div n="lb"/>pura. The supervising officials of temples were gene-
<div n="lb"/>rally called the ‘Koil adhikāri’. Normally-the younger
<div n="lb"/>brothers of the Kings were appointed in this rank.
<div n="lb"/>These temple-officers were helped in their duties by
<div n="lb"/>the Division-rulers, people of the locality and the in-
<div n="lb"/>ferior officers in the temple. When the empire of
<div n="lb"/>Kulaśekhara declined, the family of Perumpaḍappu
<div n="lb"/>got this position of ‘Koil adhikāri’. So the title ‘Koil
<div n="lb"/>adhikāri’ is added to the names of the princes of
<div n="lb"/>Cochin.
<div n="NI"/>Another one is the Mampally Edicts. This is a deed of
<div n="lb"/>granting some lands free to the temple of Airūr, in the
<div n="lb"/>name of Ādiccan Umayamma of Tṛkkalayapuram, by
<div n="lb"/>Veṇāṭṭu Śrī Vallabhankota in M.E. 149. Even such
<div n="lb"/>an unimportant thing as the granting of free lands,
<div n="lb"/>had to be effected with the permission of Cera kings
<div n="lb"/>and their councils. (T.A.S. Vol IV, Page 9).
<div n="NI"/>From these edicts it is clear that the administration of
<div n="lb"/>the temples was carried out by representatives elected
<div n="lb"/>by people. For each village temple there was an
<div n="lb"/>administrative council. These councils were controlled
<div n="lb"/>by Nāduvāzhis and Deśavāzhis (Divisional and Sub
<div n="lb"/>Divisional rulers who had Nair infantry (big or small
<div n="lb"/>as the case may be) at their disposal. The adminis-
<div n="lb"/>trative assembly met either in the open hall at the main
[Page405-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>gate of the temple or on the stage for performances.
<div n="lb"/>The rights and authorities were in the hands of the
<div n="lb"/>general assembly of the people called Nāṭṭukkūṭṭa and
<div n="lb"/>the council of the temple officials. When the Namboothi-
<div n="lb"/>ris became powerful they became members of the
<div n="lb"/>council. With this change the Kings and Koil adhikāris
<div n="lb"/>became puppets in the hands of the Namboothiris. In
<div n="lb"/>the Rāmeśvaram edict of M.E. 278 it is mentioned that
<div n="lb"/>King Rāmavarma Kulaśekhara was punished with
<div n="lb"/>retribution for his ‘hatred’ of the Āryas. Finally the
<div n="lb"/>Nambūthiris (Malayāla Brahmins) became the land-
<div n="lb"/>lords of the country.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The people af ancient Kerala.%} It is assumed that the
<div n="lb"/>ancient inhabitants of Kerala were Drāviḍas. But
<div n="lb"/>some historians have mentioned about the ‘Proto
<div n="lb"/>Dravidians and the Pre Dravidians. The hill tribes such
<div n="lb"/>as Kāṇikkārs, Mutuvas, Mala Veṭas, Pulayas, Kura-
<div n="lb"/>vas, Nāyāṭis, Malayarayas, Malayaṭis, Malap-
<div n="lb"/>paṇḍāras, Malayūrālis, Mutuvans Pullāṭis etc. are
<div n="lb"/>said to have belonged to this group. They worshipped
<div n="lb"/>several things such as stone, banyan tree, elengi tree,
<div n="lb"/>Asclepia tree, Nīm tree Terminatia Bellarica, Borassus
<div n="lb"/>flabelliformis, cassia fistula, Ghosts, thunder, rain, the
<div n="lb"/>sun etc. They worshipped good ghosts for welfare, and
<div n="lb"/>bad ghosts to avoid misfortunes. They had images of
<div n="lb"/>Māṭa, Cātta, Cāvu, Maruta, Pettucāvu, Arukula,
<div n="lb"/>Preta, Vazhipiṇakki, Āyiramilli, Parakkuṭṭi, Kāttujāti,
<div n="lb"/>Malavāzhi, Māriṇi, Nāyāṭṭu Pe Maṅkāṭṭamma,
<div n="lb"/>Muniyappa, Veṭṭakkāran and so on. They worshipped
<div n="lb"/>in small bushes, open grounds or houses. They knew
<div n="lb"/>black magic such as cursing, giving poison in meals etc.
<div n="lb"/>These uncivilized people were very particular about
<div n="lb"/>cleanliness on the occasions of delivery, menstruātion,
<div n="lb"/>death etc. They pleased bad ghosts by offering liquor,
<div n="lb"/>flesh and blood, and good ghosts with milk, ghee, honey
<div n="lb"/>etc. They buried dead bodies with a little raw rice
<div n="lb"/>meant for food at the time of entering the other world.
<div n="lb"/>They had collective worship. They sang songs at the
<div n="lb"/>time of worship using some primitive musical instru-
<div n="lb"/>ments. For each village there were elders who were
<div n="lb"/>priests and rulers. They erected stone huts in the burial
<div n="lb"/>place and buried the dead inside these in graves. These
<div n="lb"/>graves were called ‘Pāṇḍukuzhy’. The Ūrālis, continue
<div n="lb"/>the custom of posting two stones at either end of the
<div n="lb"/>grave. The custom of burial prevailed more than
<div n="lb"/>cremation.
<div n="NI"/>Nair, Nambūtiri, Īzhava, Christians, Muslims and such
<div n="lb"/>other castes came to Kerala from other places later.
<div n="NI"/>7){%Ibn Batuta and Kerala.%} Ibn Batuta who was born in the
<div n="lb"/>town of Ṭānjīr in Morocco in Africa in A.D. 1304 had
<div n="lb"/>travelled all over the Eastern countries then known. He
<div n="lb"/>had started from his house on a Haj Pilgrimage at the
<div n="lb"/>age of 22. He returned home only after 29 years, having
<div n="lb"/>travelled all over the known countries. He has written
<div n="lb"/>a book in Arabic about his travels of 29 years. One third
<div n="lb"/>of this thick volume is devoted for descriptions of his
<div n="lb"/>travels in India alone. Its name is ‘Tuh Phattunannār’.
<div n="lb"/>He passed over the Hindu Kush in A.D. 1333 and
<div n="lb"/>entered India. In the midst of his travels throughout
<div n="lb"/>the length and breadth of India, he came to Kerala
<div n="lb"/>also. He says as follows about Kerala in his book:—
<div n="lb"/>“Malabar is the country of Pepper. This country's
<div n="lb"/>length from Gokarṇa to Quilon is two months’ journey.
<div n="lb"/>All the roads in this country are rendered cool and shady
<div n="lb"/>by asclapia trees. On the roads at intervals of half an
[Page406-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>hour there are inns. Near the inn there will be a well
<div n="lb"/>and a person to give water. The non-Muslims are given
<div n="lb"/>water in pots. But water is poured into the hands of
<div n="lb"/>Muslims. Rice is served in plantain leaf and sauces
<div n="lb"/>are also served in the same leaf. Uncultivated and
<div n="lb"/>uninhabited land is not to be seen. Each house is
<div n="lb"/>situated in the centre of a cultivated area. The people
<div n="lb"/>of this country do not use animals to carry goods.
<div n="lb"/>Travelling is on foot Only Kings use horses. There is
<div n="lb"/>a conveyance called mañcal (Palanquin). Slaves are
<div n="lb"/>used as Palanquin bearers. I have seen roads which
<div n="lb"/>could be used so fearlessly, only in Kerala and, no
<div n="lb"/>where else in the world. Capital punishment is given to
<div n="lb"/>one who steals even a coconut. The people of this
<div n="lb"/>country respect Muslims.
<div n="NI"/>There are twelve kings in Malabar. None of them
<div n="lb"/>are Muslims. Many of them are powerful having an
<div n="lb"/>army of more than fifty-thousand soldiers. But there are
<div n="lb"/>no quarrels or clashes among them. The powerful do
<div n="lb"/>not have the desire to subjugate the less powerful. The
<div n="lb"/>inheritants of these kings are not sons, but nephews
<div n="lb"/>(sons of sisters). Besides the people of Kerala I have
<div n="lb"/>seen only the Muslims of the country of Salam on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Niger in Africa who have adopted the
<div n="lb"/>system of inheritance in the female line.”
<div n="NI"/>Ibn Batuta has given some minor descriptions about
<div n="lb"/>the towns of Maṅgalāpuram, Ezhumala, Kaṇṇūr
<div n="lb"/>Calicut, Pāliyam, Crāṅganūr and Quilon.
