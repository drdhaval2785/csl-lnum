SĀVITRĪ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The daughter of the Sun. This
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī is the elder sister of Tapatī. Brahmā married
<div n="lb"/>these sisters. It is stated in some Purāṇas that Sāvitrī,
<div n="lb"/>Gāyatrī, Sarasvatī all these are one and the same. But
<div n="lb"/>there is a story in Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>17, stating that Brahmā once went to Gāyatrī in the
<div n="lb"/>absence of Sāvitrī, who got angry at this and cursed all
<div n="lb"/>the Gods.
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā went to Puṣkara to perform a sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, Viṣṇu and all the hermits came there. Everything
<div n="lb"/>was ready for the sacrifice according to convention.
<div n="lb"/>But Sāvitrī, who had been engaged in household duties
<div n="lb"/>had not yet arrived. So a priest was sent to bring her.
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī said to the priest, “I have not finished dressing.
<div n="lb"/>There are so many things to be done here. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī, Bhavānī, Gaṅgā, Svāhā, Indrāṇī, celestial
<div n="lb"/>women, wives of Ṛṣis (hermits), none of these have
<div n="lb"/>arrived yet. How can I enter the hall as the only
<div n="lb"/>woman?” The priest returned and reported that it
<div n="lb"/>was not convenient for Sāvitrī to come just then, as she
<div n="lb"/>had so much work to do. Brahmā became angry and
<div n="lb"/>said to Indra. “Lord Indra, it is up to you to bring
<div n="lb"/>me a wife from wherever you like. But it must be
<div n="lb"/>done instantly.” Hearing the order of Brahmā, Indra
<div n="lb"/>selected Gāyatrī who was a good-natured damsel of a
<div n="lb"/>cowherd's family, and brought her to the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>dais. With the blessings of the hermits and gods, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>held her hand and acknowledged her as his wife.
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī dressed well, adorned herself with ornaments and
<div n="lb"/>reached the sacrificial hall. She saw the marriage scene
<div n="lb"/>and became furious. Everybody in the hall held their
<div n="lb"/>breath, thinking of the approaching danger. Trembling
<div n="lb"/>with anger Sāvitrī said “Lo; Brahmā, how is it that you
<div n="lb"/>have committed this sin? Have you not married me with
[Page712-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>fire as witness? I am your wife. Are you not ashamed
<div n="lb"/>of this?” The three godheads shivered with fear. Sāvitrī
<div n="lb"/>cursed everybody. The curse given to Brahmā was that
<div n="lb"/>no body should worship him on any other day except
<div n="lb"/>the month of Kārttika in the year. She cursed Indra
<div n="lb"/>that enemies would enter the world of gods and would
<div n="lb"/>make Indra their captive. Sāvitrī cried out that Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>would take the birth of man by the curse of Bhṛgu. She
<div n="lb"/>cursed Śiva that he would lose his manliness. She gave
<div n="lb"/>Agni the curse that he would eat anything and every-
<div n="lb"/>thing without the discrimination of purity or impurity.
<div n="lb"/>She cursed the Brahmins that they would, in future per-
<div n="lb"/>form sacrifice merely with a view to obtain gifts and
<div n="lb"/>that they would be wandering about from temple to
<div n="lb"/>temple and from tīrtha to tīrtha merely for gain.”
<div n="NI"/>Uttering these words of curse, Sāvitrī left the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>hall. Lakṣmī and some other goddesses followed her a
<div n="lb"/>little while. Then they begged for permission to return.
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī said to them, “Lakṣmī! You are leaving me. Is it
<div n="lb"/>not so? Right. Hereafter you shall be permanent no-
<div n="lb"/>where. May you become the companion of the wicked,
<div n="lb"/>the wavering, the low-minded, the sinner, the cruel, the
<div n="lb"/>foolish etc. Indrāṇī also wants to return. Hear this:
<div n="lb"/>Indra will kill Vṛtra and incur the sin of Brahmahatyā
<div n="lb"/>and at that time Nahuṣa will capture heaven. Then
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa will abuse you.”
<div n="NI"/>Looking at the celestial women who were going to the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial hall, Sāvitrī said; Look, Ye celestial women.
<div n="lb"/>None of you will give birth to child and you will
<div n="lb"/>not enjoy the pleasure of nurturing a child.” Saying
<div n="lb"/>these words Sāvitrī left the hall. Not knowing what to
<div n="lb"/>do, all sat there. Instantly Gāyatrī rose up and looking
<div n="lb"/>at everybody, said as a remission of curses: “I shall remit
<div n="lb"/>all curses. Those who worship Brahmā, will be blessed
<div n="lb"/>with the pleasure of wife and children and wealth and
<div n="lb"/>they will unite with Brahmā. Even if Indra is taken
<div n="lb"/>captive, he will be made free by his son and will become
<div n="lb"/>the king of heaven again. Viṣṇu will rescue his wife and
<div n="lb"/>kill the enemy. The phallus will be worshipped in all
<div n="lb"/>the worlds. As Brahmins are the gods on earth the gift
<div n="lb"/>you take, will be considered your dues. Lakṣmī! you
<div n="lb"/>need not worry. Everybody will worship you. He whom
<div n="lb"/>you favour will become a well-to-do person and he whom
<div n="lb"/>you forsake will become miserable. You Indrāṇī! Because
<div n="lb"/>of Nahuṣa's arrogance Agastya will change him to a big
<div n="lb"/>python and he will fall to the earth. The celestial maids
<div n="lb"/>will have no desire for children. So childlessness will
<div n="lb"/>not make you miserable.” By these words of blessings
<div n="lb"/>of Gāyatrī, everybody in the sacrificial hall was paci-
<div n="lb"/>fied.

<div n="NI"/>(1) Sāvitrī shines in the palace of Brahmā. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 34).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Sāvitrī is the sovereign deity of the mantra Gāyatrī.
<div n="lb"/>This goddess Sāvitrī rose up from the sacrificial fire of
<div n="lb"/>King Aśvapati and gave him a boon, and accordingly a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Sāvitrī was born to the King. This
<div n="lb"/>princess was Sāvitrī the wife of Satyavān. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 290).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śiva, on starting for Tripuradahana (the burning
<div n="lb"/>of Tripuras), placed Sāvitrī as the bridles of his horses.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 202, Verse 75).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Jāpaka Brahmin worshipped Devī Sāvitrī,
<div n="lb"/>who appeared before him and gave him boons. As the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin was engaged in deep meditation and prayer,
[Page713-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>he did not see the Devī when she appeared. It was due
<div n="lb"/>to this piety that the Brahmin was given boons. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 199).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Devī Sāvitrī appeared before Satya, a brahm-
