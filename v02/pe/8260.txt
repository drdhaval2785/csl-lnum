VIDURA II¦. A Kṣatriya who lived in Pāñcāla. The
<div n="lb"/>story of this Vidura, who had killed a Brahmin because
<div n="lb"/>of his want, is given in Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmikhanḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 91. The story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there lived a Kṣatriya, named Vidura, in
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla. Because of penury he killed a Brahmin. After
<div n="lb"/>that the Kṣatriya discarded his lock of hair and Brahma-
[Page850-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>string and went to every house saying “Look, here am
<div n="lb"/>I, a slayer of Brahmin. Please, give alms to the drunk-
<div n="lb"/>ard and killer of a Brahmin.” Saying thus he walked
<div n="lb"/>from house to house and took alms. But he did not get
<div n="lb"/>remission of Brahmahatyā (killing of a Brahmin).
<div n="NI"/>Filled with grief and sorrow and mental worry the
<div n="lb"/>sinner Vidura sat in the shade of a tree. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Candraśarmā, a Brahmin of Magadha came there. He
<div n="lb"/>was a wicked man who had killed his teacher because
<div n="lb"/>of inordinate lust in consequence of which he had been
<div n="lb"/>forsaken by his own people. Vidura asked Candraśarmā
<div n="lb"/>who wore no sign of a Brāhmaṇa, what he was. Candra-
<div n="lb"/>śarmā told his story to Vidura who in return told him
<div n="lb"/>his sinful acts.
<div n="NI"/>At this time another Brahmin named Vedaśarmā came
<div n="lb"/>there. He also was a sinner. The three of them told each
<div n="lb"/>other about their sinful acts. At this time Vallāla, a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya came there. He was a drunkard who had killed
<div n="lb"/>cows. These four desperate sinners travelled together
<div n="lb"/>and visited several tīrthas (holy baths). But they did not
<div n="lb"/>get remission of their sins. At last they started for
<div n="lb"/>Kālañjaragiri.
<div n="NI"/>While these desperate sinners were living in Kālañjara
<div n="lb"/>a poor Brahmin came there. He asked them why they
<div n="lb"/>were so sad. They told him everything. When he heard
<div n="lb"/>their stories he felt pity for them. The old Brahmin said
<div n="lb"/>“You sinners should go to Prayāga, Puṣkara, Sarvatīrtha
<div n="lb"/>and Vārāṇasī and bathe in the Gaṅgā on New Moon days
<div n="lb"/>and you will become free from sin.” They obeyed the
<div n="lb"/>old Brahmin and went to the holy places told by him.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Vidura and his friends became sinless.
