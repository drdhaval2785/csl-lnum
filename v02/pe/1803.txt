DEVADATTA I¦. A famous brahmin boy whose story is
<div n="lb"/>described in the Kathāsaritsāgara.
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta was the son of the Brahmin, Haridatta of
<div n="lb"/>Kambukapura. Though as a boy Devadatta learnt all
<div n="lb"/>the arts and sciences when he grew up to be a youth he
<div n="lb"/>became a very wayward fellow. Dice-play became his
<div n="lb"/>main job. One day in a game of dice he lost even his
<div n="lb"/>clothes, and being afraid of his father, he left the place
<div n="lb"/>without returning home.
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta roamed about, and during one such trip
<div n="lb"/>he saw a deserted temple, and a muni called Jālapāda
<div n="lb"/>engaged in reciting mantras. Devadatta prostrated be-
<div n="lb"/>fore the muni and told him all the details about himself.
<div n="lb"/>The muni accepted Devadatta as his śiṣya and promised
<div n="lb"/>to secure vidyādharahood for him.
<div n="NI"/>Next night Jālapāda led Devadatta to a burning ghat,
[Page208-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>nearby the temple. After conducting Pūjā in the shade
<div n="lb"/>of a fig tree with offerings of Pāyasa and Vaiśva-
<div n="lb"/>devabali the muni told Devadatta thus: “You should
<div n="lb"/>come here daily and perform pūjā like this, and pray
<div n="lb"/>at the close of it, ‘Oh! Vidyutprabhā! please accept my
<div n="lb"/>pūjā.’
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta acted according to the above advice of the
<div n="lb"/>muni, and one day, at the close of his pūjā the tree broke
<div n="lb"/>open into two and a beautiful female who appeared from
<div n="lb"/>it took him with her saying that her mistress wanted him.
<div n="lb"/>He was thus taken to a house studded with gems wherein
<div n="lb"/>he saw a noble lady seated on a cot. She caught Deva-
<div n="lb"/>datta by his hands and after seating him alongside said
<div n="lb"/>to him: “I am Vidyutprabhā, daughter of the Yakṣa
<div n="lb"/>king Ratnavarṣa. I am a virgin girl. Muni Jālapāda
<div n="lb"/>has worshipped me so much that I have decided to
<div n="lb"/>fulfil his desire. I am in love with you and you will
<div n="lb"/>please wed me.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Devadatta married Vidyutprabhā and lived
<div n="lb"/>there with her. In due course she conceived, and Deva-
<div n="lb"/>datta met Jālapāda and told him about the whole
<div n="lb"/>affair, and the muni, to achieve his personal object
<div n="lb"/>asked Devadatta to cut open the abdomen of Vidyut-
<div n="lb"/>prabhā and take to him the child found therein. Deva-
<div n="lb"/>datta did not at all relish the idea. Yet reluctant to
<div n="lb"/>disobey his preceptor he returned to his wife. She permit-
<div n="lb"/>ted him to carry out the directions of the muni, yet his
<div n="lb"/>mind did not approve of the action. Then Vidyutprabhā
<div n="lb"/>herself cut open her abdomen, took the child out of it
<div n="lb"/>and placing it before her husband told him thus:—
<div n="lb"/>“He who eats the child will become a Vidyādhara.
<div n="lb"/>Take it. I was a Vidyādharī turned into a Yakṣī by a
<div n="lb"/>curse, and to cut open my abdomen and take out the
<div n="lb"/>child like this was the redemption promised me from the
<div n="lb"/>curse, and now I go to the Vidyādhara world; we shall
<div n="lb"/>meet there.” And she disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>In great sorrow Devadatta brought the child to Jāla-
<div n="lb"/>pāda who, after sending him out on the pretext of his
<div n="lb"/>(Jālapāda's) performing Bhairavapūja, ate up the child.
<div n="lb"/>Devadatta returned and when he knew of the action of
<div n="lb"/>his preceptor he was overcome with rage. But the latter
<div n="lb"/>rose up to the skies assuming the form of a Vidyādhara.
<div n="lb"/>Devadatta made up his mind to anyhow take revenge
<div n="lb"/>upon Jālapāda, and he also went to Vidyādharaloka with
<div n="lb"/>the help of a Vetāla whom he befriended by offering
<div n="lb"/>human flesh. And, there he saw Jālapāda drunk with
<div n="lb"/>pride at his Vidyādharahood sitting on a throne of
<div n="lb"/>gems in a mansion. Meanwhile Vidyutprabhā who was
<div n="lb"/>now once more a Vidyādharī had turned down the
<div n="lb"/>advances made by the erstwhile Jālapāda for her love.
<div n="lb"/>But, at the sight of Devadatta her face flushed with love
<div n="lb"/>for him while, in fear, the sword fell down from the
<div n="lb"/>hands of Jālapāda who now fainted. Devadatta pre-
<div n="lb"/>vented the Vetāla from killing Jālapāda and he (Vetāla)
<div n="lb"/>at the instance of Devadatta took Jālapāda to the burn-
<div n="lb"/>ing ghat and cremated him there.
<div n="NI"/>Kātyāyanīdevī at this time appeared before Devadatta
<div n="lb"/>and pleased with his courage appointed him as chief of
<div n="lb"/>the Vidyādharas. He wedded Vidyutprabhā and lived
<div n="lb"/>happily. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Caturdārikālaṃbakaṃ,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 3).
