PAYYANNŪR¦ PĀṬṬU. This is a work in Malayālam
<div n="lb"/>written during a very ancient period of Malayālam
<div n="lb"/>literature. A complete edition of the same has not
<div n="lb"/>yet been received. The plot as could be gathered
<div n="lb"/>from records available is the following:
<div n="NI"/>Nīlakeśī, a woman born in a very noble family in
<div n="lb"/>Triśśivaperūr did not have any sons though she accept-
<div n="lb"/>ed many husbands for the sake of progeny. At last
<div n="lb"/>she decided to perform penance. She left her place
<div n="lb"/>alone on a pilgrimage and reached Kāccil, a famous
<div n="lb"/>trading centre near Ezhimala. There lived a merchant
<div n="lb"/>named Nambucetty alias Combucetty who was the
<div n="lb"/>chief man of the place. He talked with Nīlakeśī and
<div n="lb"/>accepted her as his wife. She got a son of him named
<div n="lb"/>Nambuśāri Aran. Pleased at the birth of a son the
<div n="lb"/>parents gave a grand feast at the big Payyannūr plains.
<div n="lb"/>At that time the brothers of Nīlakeśī reached the place
<div n="lb"/>in a ship. They climbed the fort-walls and tried to
[Page588-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>enter the grounds. Some people objected to it and at that
<div n="lb"/>time Nambucetty came there and beat them to death. On
<div n="lb"/>hearing about this Nīlakesī left everything behind includ-
<div n="lb"/>ing her son and went again on a pilgrimage. When
<div n="lb"/>the son grew up the father taught his son everything
<div n="lb"/>about trade and ships. The father gave him a new ship
<div n="lb"/>for trading and the son taking along with him Pāṇḍyas,
<div n="lb"/>Jonakas, Coliyas, Pāppavas and a Yavana and a huge
<div n="lb"/>stock of goods put the ship into the sea and fearlessly
<div n="lb"/>went for trading. After passing through many ports
<div n="lb"/>and crossing another ocean he reached Ponmala (the
<div n="lb"/>mountain of gold) and bartered his goods for a heap of
<div n="lb"/>gold. He came back to his own land and was one day
<div n="lb"/>playing chess with his father when a Sannyāsinī (female
<div n="lb"/>ascetic) came there. When she was given alms she
<div n="lb"/>requested to be allowed to talk to the young merchant.
<div n="lb"/>The Sannyāsinī was none other than Nīlakeśī the
<div n="lb"/>mother of Nambuśāri Aran, the young merchant. She
<div n="lb"/>requested him to come to Payyannūr for a feast conduct-
<div n="lb"/>ed by a woman there and he agreed to that. But the
<div n="lb"/>father objected to it. But when the son persisted in
<div n="lb"/>going, the father sent him with the sons of a cetty, a
<div n="lb"/>few people from Maṇigrāma and a huge stock of goods
<div n="lb"/>for trade. The poem ends there thus with 104 verses.
<div n="NI"/>There are different opinions about the story among
<div n="lb"/>literary critics and historians. Gundert writes about it
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“This is a piece of Malayālam work most ancient
<div n="lb"/>of all that I have seen. This is a creation in Malayā-
<div n="lb"/>lam before that language became diluted with meaning-
<div n="lb"/>less indeclinable Sanskrit words.” According to
<div n="lb"/>Gundert this poem was written before the poem
<div n="lb"/>Rāmacarita was written and thus in the 3rd century
<div n="lb"/>M.E.
