AṢṬĀVAKRA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The sage Uddālaka had a disciple named
<div n="lb"/>Khagodara (Kahodara) and a daughter named Sujāṭā.
<div n="lb"/>Appreciating the devotion and good conduct of his
<div n="lb"/>disciple, Uddālaka gave his daughter Sujātā in marri-
<div n="lb"/>age to him. Sujātā became pregnant. When once
<div n="lb"/>Khagodara was reciting from the Vedas the babe in the
<div n="lb"/>womb of Sujātā said, “I have learnt the mantra you
<div n="lb"/>are chanting but the way you chant it is wrong”. (The
<div n="lb"/>vibrations of sound created by the utterance of each
<div n="lb"/>word is important). Khagodara was angry and he curs-
<div n="lb"/>ed his babe in the womb thus “Since your mind seems
<div n="lb"/>to be crooked let your body also be of that type, with
[Page065-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>curves all over”. When Sujātā delivered the child it
<div n="lb"/>had eight bends and light curves and so the boy was
<div n="lb"/>named Aṣṭāvakra, meaning one with eight bends.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 132, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Father died before he was born.%} When Sujātā was preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant they suffered much from poverty and at the in-
<div n="lb"/>sistence of Sujātā, Khagodara went to the King Janaka,
<div n="lb"/>to beg for some money. Janaka was performing a yāga
<div n="lb"/>then and so Khagodara had to wait. When at last he
<div n="lb"/>went to the royal assembly he was asked to enter into
<div n="lb"/>a polemical contest with Vāndīna, the court scholar and
<div n="lb"/>having been defeated by him was asked to drown him-
<div n="lb"/>self.
<div n="NI"/>Uddālaka got a son named Śvetaketu and Sujātā deli-
<div n="lb"/>vered Aṣṭāvakra. Both the boys grew in the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>on great intimacy and Sujātā withheld the news of the
<div n="lb"/>death of her husband from the boys. (Chapter 132,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Khagodara was got back.%} One day the two boys
<div n="lb"/>went to bathe in the river and during a controversial
<div n="lb"/>talk Śvetaketu said that Aṣṭāvakra had no father. This
<div n="lb"/>teased him much and Aṣṭāvakra went to his mother
<div n="lb"/>and gathered all the facts about his father. He went,
<div n="lb"/>then, straight to the royal assembly of King Janaka.
<div n="lb"/>He was not allowed inside. The gate keeper said that he
<div n="lb"/>was only a boy and only learned men could go inside
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial hall. Aṣṭāvakra contended that neither
<div n="lb"/>size nor age was any indication of one's knowledge or
<div n="lb"/>worth and got himself admitted into the hall. There
<div n="lb"/>he entered into a polemical contest with the same court
<div n="lb"/>scholar, Vāndīna, who had killed his father. Vāndīna
<div n="lb"/>was defeated and was thrown into the same river in
<div n="lb"/>which his father had drowned himself. The moment
<div n="lb"/>Vāndīna fell into the river Khagodara rose up
<div n="lb"/>from there and the father and son along with Śveta-
<div n="lb"/>ketu returned to the āśrama. Khagodara then took his
<div n="lb"/>son for a bath and when it was over Aṣṭāvakra became
<div n="lb"/>a bright boy without crooks. (Chapter 133, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.)
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage.%} Aṣṭāvakra wanted to marry Suprabhā, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of a sage named Vadānya. When Vadānya was
<div n="lb"/>approached for this the Sage decided to test the love
<div n="lb"/>which Aṣṭāvakra had towards his daughter and said: “I
<div n="lb"/>am going to test you. You go to the north to the Himā-
<div n="lb"/>layas. Pay homage to Śiva and Pārvatī and go further
<div n="lb"/>north. There you will find a very beautiful damsel. You
<div n="lb"/>talk to her and return and when you come back I shall
<div n="lb"/>give you my daughter.”
<div n="NI"/>Accepting this challenge Aṣṭāvakra went north. When
<div n="lb"/>he went to the Himālayas Kubera entertained him. He
<div n="lb"/>remained there for a year enjoying the dances of celes-
<div n="lb"/>tial maidens and then, after worshipping Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī went further north. There he came across seven
<div n="lb"/>very attractive women. At the command of Aṣṭāvakra
<div n="lb"/>the eldest of the lot, Uttarā, remained with him; all the
<div n="lb"/>rest left the place immediately she started making love
<div n="lb"/>with him and requested him to marry her. But Aṣṭā-
<div n="lb"/>vakra did not yield and told her about his promise to
<div n="lb"/>Vadānya. Pleased at this reply Uttarā revealed that she
<div n="lb"/>was the queen of the north in disguise and was testing
<div n="lb"/>him. She then blessed Aṣṭāvakra who fulfilling his
<div n="lb"/>mission successfully, returned and married the girl he
<div n="lb"/>wanted. (Chapter 19, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Another version of how the body became crooked.%} There
<div n="lb"/>is another story also about Aṣṭāvakra. Once there lived
[Page065-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>a sage named Asita. He did great penance to please Śiva
<div n="lb"/>to bless him with a child. Śiva blessed him and he got a
<div n="lb"/>son named Devala. Rambhā, the queen of devaloka, fell
<div n="lb"/>in love with him but Devala did not yield to her wishes.
<div n="lb"/>Then Rambhā cursed him and made him into one with
<div n="lb"/>eight crooks. Thus Devala came to be called Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="lb"/>He then did penance for six thousand years and Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vān Kṛṣṇa accompanied by Rādhā appeared before him.
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā was shocked by the ugliness of the sage and did
<div n="lb"/>not relish his sight. But Kṛṣṇa asking her to remain
<div n="lb"/>quiet went and embraced him. At once Aṣṭāvakra lost
<div n="lb"/>all his crooks and became a beautiful man. At that time
<div n="lb"/>a chariot descended from heaven and all of them went
<div n="lb"/>to heaven in it. (Brahmavaivartta Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other information.%} (1) Aṣṭāvakra was also present
<div n="lb"/>among the ṛṣis who partook in the coronation ceremony
<div n="lb"/>conducted after Rāma's return to Ayodhyā from Laṅkā.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttararāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Aṣṭāvakra cursed those. celestial maidens who re-
<div n="lb"/>buked him for his ugliness and they were born on earth
<div n="lb"/>as the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. When after the death of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa they were being taken by Arjuna to the north they
<div n="lb"/>were forcibly taken by some of the shepherds. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>15, Agni Purāṇa).
