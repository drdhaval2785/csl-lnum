ṚTUKĀLA¦. The time that is most auspicious for sexual
<div n="lb"/>intercourse for a woman with her husband. In ancient
<div n="lb"/>India certain days were prescribed as the best period for
<div n="lb"/>women to become pregnant. This period is called
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtukāla. (Ṛtu—Menstruation. Kāla—time, period.)
<div n="NI"/>The sixteen days following menstruation are supposed
<div n="lb"/>to be good; but the first three days are not very good
<div n="lb"/>and it is advisable not to have sexual intercourse during
<div n="lb"/>those days. The next even days beginning with the
<div n="lb"/>fourth day (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th)
<div n="lb"/>are the best days for coitus if a male issue (a son) is
<div n="lb"/>desired. The odd days (5th, 7th, 9th, 11th 13th, 15th)
<div n="lb"/>are to be preferred if a female issue (daughter) is desired.
<div n="lb"/>(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 151).
