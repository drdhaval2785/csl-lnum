MAYŪRADHVAJA¦. A King of Ratnanagara. After per-
<div n="lb"/>forming seven Aśvamedha yāgas this King started
<div n="lb"/>another Aśvamedha in the Narmadā river valley. The
<div n="lb"/>task of protecting the sacrificial horse was undertaken
<div n="lb"/>by the King's son Sucitra or Tāmradhvaja. He set out
<div n="lb"/>for the conquest of the world with the chief minister
<div n="lb"/>Bahudhvaja. On his return, he came across Yudhiṣṭhira's
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha horse at the city of Maṇipur. The heroic
<div n="lb"/>Sucitra encountered Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who were
<div n="lb"/>leading the horse. After making them unconscious,
<div n="lb"/>he entered the city with the sacrificial horse.
<div n="NI"/>When they recovered their senses, Śrī Kṛṣṇa disguised
<div n="lb"/>himself as a Brāhmaṇa and Arjuna as a Brāhmaṇa boy
<div n="lb"/>and they went to Mayūradhvaja's palace. The King
<div n="lb"/>welcomed them respectfully. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, in his disguise
<div n="lb"/>as Brāhmaṇa told the King that he was coming from
<div n="lb"/>Dharmapurī to meet the King's priest, Kṛṣṇa who was
<div n="lb"/>to officiate at the marriage of his (Brāhmaṇa's) son. He
<div n="lb"/>added that unfortunately on his way through a forest
<div n="lb"/>a lion caught hold of his son. Although he prayed to
<div n="lb"/>Lord Narasiṃha, the boy could not be rescued. The
<div n="lb"/>lion told him that he would release his son, if the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa persuaded Mayūradhvaja to offer one half of
<div n="lb"/>his body as food to the lion.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing the Brāhmaṇa's story, Mayūradhvaja agreed
<div n="lb"/>to give half of his body to the lion. Just then his queen
<div n="lb"/>Kumudvatī appeared before them and said, “I am the
<div n="lb"/>left half (Vāmabhāga) of the King. You may take me
<div n="lb"/>and offer me as food for the lion.” But the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>replied that the lion wanted the right half of the King's
<div n="lb"/>body.
<div n="NI"/>When the King heard this, he readily agreed to give the
<div n="lb"/>right half of his own body. Accordingly, they started
<div n="lb"/>cutting his body into two halves. Just then, seeing tears
<div n="lb"/>coming down from Mayūradhvaja's left eye, the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa said:—“I find that you are in great sorrow; I do
<div n="lb"/>not wish to accept a gift which is not given whole-
<div n="lb"/>heartedly.” Mayūradhvaja explained that his tears were
<div n="lb"/>not caused by pain or sorrow. His left side was dis-
<div n="lb"/>appointed in not being able to be of as much service as
<div n="lb"/>the right side.
<div n="NI"/>When Śrī Kṛṣṇa heard these words of the King, he
<div n="lb"/>resumed his own shape and embraced him and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him. After that Mayūradhvaja completed his yāga and
<div n="lb"/>started with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, taking Yudhiṣṭhira's
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial horse with them. (Jaimini; Aśvamedha:
<div n="lb"/>41-46).
