ŚAŚIKALĀ¦. Daughter of Subāhu, King of Kāśī. She
<div n="lb"/>was married by a prince Sudarśana who had been
<div n="lb"/>driven out of his kingdom by Yudhājit.
<div n="NI"/>As she became a young woman Śaśikalā heard about
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana, who lived in the forest with his mother and
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with him. One night Devī appeared in
<div n="lb"/>dream to her and told her that marriage with Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>would take place, and at those words of Devī she
<div n="lb"/>awoke from sleep and began laughing. Though her
<div n="lb"/>mother asked Śaśikalā about the reason for her laugh-
<div n="lb"/>ing thus, she answered not, but continued laughing.
<div n="lb"/>One day while she was picnicking in the Campaka
<div n="lb"/>forest, an old brahmin came there and described to
<div n="lb"/>her about the great personality and beauty of Sudar-
<div n="lb"/>śana, who then was staying with his mother at
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvājāśrama. Śaśikalā's heart yearned to be with
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana.
<div n="NI"/>Sudarśana, after the death of his father Dhruvasandhi,
<div n="lb"/>lived with his mother Manoramā and her father. But,
<div n="lb"/>Yudhājit killed Manoramā's mother also. It was after
<div n="lb"/>this that Sudarśana and his mother took refuge in the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Bharadvājamuni. One of those days, Niṣāda,
<div n="lb"/>King of Śṛṅgiverapura and a friend of Sudarśana's
<div n="lb"/>father (Dhruvasandhi) came to Bharadvājāśrama and
<div n="lb"/>presented a chariot, which possessed mysterious powers,
<div n="lb"/>to Sudarśana. The munis were pleased at this and
<div n="lb"/>imparted to Sudarśana the Kāmarājamantra, which gave
<div n="lb"/>one who practised it all that one desired, and after the
<div n="lb"/>above incident Sudarśana began slowly to come out of
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama. He went about the forests in the chariot
<div n="lb"/>presented by Niṣāda, and he was astonished to find
<div n="lb"/>many an armed soldier surround him wherever he
<div n="lb"/>went. This happened because of the mysterious powers
<div n="lb"/>of the chariot.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that King Subāhu decided to con-
<div n="lb"/>duct the Svayaṃvara of his daughter Śaśikalā. Kings
<div n="lb"/>from all lands came. Śaśikalā told her mother in secret
<div n="lb"/>about her desire to marry Sudarśana, and the mother
<div n="lb"/>in turn told about this to the father. But, he was not
<div n="lb"/>for it. Then Śaśikalā sent a messenger secretly to
<div n="lb"/>Sudar ana to request him to be present at the
<div n="lb"/>Svayaṃvara, and Sudarśana and his mother started for
<div n="lb"/>the palace of the King of Kāśī and when they reached
<div n="lb"/>it, kings like Yudhājit had already come there. A
<div n="lb"/>rumour was spread that Subāhu, insultingly ignoring
<div n="lb"/>all the crowned heads, was going to marry his daughter
[Page700-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>to Sudarśana, a mere beggar. The assembled Kings,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, got themselves ready to pick a row with
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu, but, he pacified them with the assurance that
<div n="lb"/>the Svayaṃvara of Śaśikalā would formally be conduct-
<div n="lb"/>ed and her husband could then be selected by herself.
<div n="lb"/>That night Śaśikalā's parents tried their best to divert
<div n="lb"/>her heart away from Sudarśana, to no purpose and the
<div n="lb"/>same night she was duly married to him. By the next
<div n="lb"/>morning news about the marriage became public and
<div n="lb"/>all the Kings, who had come for the Svayaṃvara
<div n="lb"/>decided in conference to kill Sudarśana on his way back
<div n="lb"/>home with his wife, and abduct Śaśikalā. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>on the fourth day after the wedding when Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>and Śaśikalā were returning to Ayodhyā escorted by
<div n="lb"/>the army allotted to them by Subāhu, King Yudhājit
<div n="lb"/>and his followers attacked them from their hiding place.
<div n="lb"/>In the battle that ensued Devī appeared and helped
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana, who defeated the enemies. People of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā received with enthusiasm the victorious Sudar-
<div n="lb"/>śana and he was crowned their King. In later years he
<div n="lb"/>became famous as emperor Sudarśana.
