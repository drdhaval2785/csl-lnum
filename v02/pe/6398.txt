ŚATARUDRA¦. The story of Śatarudra was imparted
<div n="lb"/>to Śrī Rāma by Vyāsa to show that all life is mere
<div n="lb"/>illusion or different complexes of the mind. Śataru-
<div n="lb"/>dropākhyāna is the story of a contemplative sannyāsin.
<div n="lb"/>Whatever subject or object he conceived in his mind
<div n="lb"/>used to assume its form as water changes into waves,
<div n="lb"/>and it was a boon or great asset, which his heart had
<div n="lb"/>acquired as a result of its purity. He confined himself
<div n="lb"/>to his āśrama and thought about things one after the
<div n="lb"/>other.
<div n="NI"/>To start with, Śatarudra thought to himself that he
<div n="lb"/>was a ‘dream person’ called Jīvaṭa. While picnicking
<div n="lb"/>in the streets of a ‘dream-built city’ the ‘dream person’
<div n="lb"/>overcome by the effect of liquor remained in an
<div n="lb"/>unconscious state for some time. He also felt imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately to be a brahmin learned in the Vedas. ‘Jīvaṭa’,
<div n="lb"/>who transformed himself thus into a brahmin slept
<div n="lb"/>during day-time overcome by exhaustion on account
<div n="lb"/>of work. At once he dreamt himself to have been
<div n="lb"/>transformed into a feudal lord or tributary King, who,
<div n="lb"/>after taking his meals went to sleep when he dreamt
<div n="lb"/>that he was changed into a great King. The King,
<div n="lb"/>who ruled the country peacefully changed himself one
<div n="lb"/>day in dream into a celestial woman. The next dream
<div n="lb"/>was that the woman, while in deep sleep after a
<div n="lb"/>hilarious sexual act, was turned into a she-deer. The
<div n="lb"/>she-deer, in dream turned into a creeper, and it duly
<div n="lb"/>bore leaves, flowers and fruits. The creeper felt that it
[Page702-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>entwined and climbed some trees. Then he (Jīvaṭa)
<div n="lb"/>went into deep sleep, absolutely unaware of himself,
<div n="lb"/>for some time. Then he dreamt himself to have chang-
<div n="lb"/>ed into a beetle. The beetle felt attracted towards a
<div n="lb"/>lotus flower and got captured therein. An elephant
<div n="lb"/>from the forest nearby entered the ‘lotus pond’, plucked
<div n="lb"/>and tore into pieces the lotus flower. As the beetle had
<div n="lb"/>got fixed in its mind and imagination the picture of
<div n="lb"/>the elephant it became a tusker elephant after its death.
<div n="lb"/>While roaming about in the forest the elephant fell
<div n="lb"/>into a deep pit and the King's men captured and listed
<div n="lb"/>it in the army. A number of beetles gathered round
<div n="lb"/>the elephant to suck its ichor (madajala). Because
<div n="lb"/>it thought about the beetles the elephant, after its
<div n="lb"/>death in battle, again became a beetle, which imagined
<div n="lb"/>about the swan in the lotus-pond. The beetle one day
<div n="lb"/>got captured in the lotus-flower and became a swan on
<div n="lb"/>being killed by the elephant. Thus the beetle, after
<div n="lb"/>taking many births and forms, became ultimately
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's vehicle, the swan. While the swan once
<div n="lb"/>moved about the surrounding places of mount Kailāsa
<div n="lb"/>it saw Rudra and imagining itself to be Rudra
<div n="lb"/>(Rudroham—I am Rudra) attained Rudrahood.
<div n="lb"/>While living happily with all the parapher-
<div n="lb"/>nalia of Rudra he remembered his past lives, and
<div n="lb"/>wondering about the many continuous dreams of his,
<div n="lb"/>in solitude he thought like this:—“The power of
<div n="lb"/>Māyā (illusion) which rules over everything in the
<div n="lb"/>world is really wonderful. How curious and peculiar
<div n="lb"/>is the cunningness or trickeries of Māyā in creating,
<div n="lb"/>like mirage, the illusion that things, which did not
<div n="lb"/>really exist, existed. Mistaking Māyā or mirage as the
<div n="lb"/>truth and the fact, I roamed about in many a material
<div n="lb"/>desert. In one form of life I was born as Jīvaṭa, in
<div n="lb"/>another, King: in yet another, swan etc. and now I
<div n="lb"/>have attained Rudra-hood. Hundred Caturyugas and
<div n="lb"/>thousand years have passed in this ‘show” Now, I
<div n="lb"/>will return and personally see all past episodes and I
<div n="lb"/>shall identify them all with myself after bestowing
<div n="lb"/>knowledge on them.
<div n="NI"/>Having made up his mind like this, Rudra descended
<div n="lb"/>to the state of the old Sannyāsin. He infused life and
<div n="lb"/>vitality into the dead body of the sannyāsin that was
<div n="lb"/>there. The Sannyāsin remembered his old illusions
<div n="lb"/>and hallucinations. He had attained Rudrahood after
<div n="lb"/>crossing various stages from being Jīvaṭa. Then both
<div n="lb"/>of them together came to the Jīvaṭa stage, awoke the
<div n="lb"/>‘dream-person’ by giving him mind and vitality. After-
<div n="lb"/>wards the three of them, who assumed single form by
<div n="lb"/>the composition of different personalities, attained
<div n="lb"/>various stages like brahmin etc., awoke them too and
<div n="lb"/>added them to themselves (the three). Thus there came
<div n="lb"/>about to be hundred persons formed from aspects or
<div n="lb"/>fractions of Rudra, and at the instance of the real
<div n="lb"/>Rudra they returned to their homes and lived there
<div n="lb"/>happily with their sons, relations etc. Those hundred
<div n="lb"/>persons are the Śatarudras. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha, Śatarudro-
<div n="lb"/>pākhyāna). In Verse 13, Chapter 150 of Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Mahābhārata also is found references to the
<div n="lb"/>Śatarudras.
