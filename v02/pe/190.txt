AMBĀ¦. Daughter of a King of Kāśī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Ambā and Vicitravīrya.%} Ambā is an ill-starred
<div n="lb"/>character in the story of the Mahābhārata. She had
<div n="lb"/>two younger sisters named Ambikā and Ambālikā.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma, who had taken a vow to remain a bachelor for
<div n="lb"/>life, had once taken Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā, the
<div n="lb"/>three daughters of the King of Kāśī, to Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>The circumstances in which this happened, are descri-
<div n="lb"/>ed in Devī Bhāgavata, Prathama Skandha as follows:
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu, a King of the Candra Vaṃśa, had two wives,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Bhīṣma was the son of Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>and Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya were the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī. Soon after Bhīṣma's birth, Gaṅgā vanished.
<div n="lb"/>After a long period of reign, Śantanu also died. Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī and the three sons were left behind in the palace.
<div n="lb"/>According to a vow he had taken long ago, Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb"/>instead of succeeding to his father's throne, left it to his
<div n="lb"/>brother Citrāṅgada. Once Citrāṅgada went for hunting
<div n="lb"/>in the forest. There he came across a Gandharva named
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada. The Gandharva did not like another man
[Page028-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>with his own name to be living in this world. So he
<div n="lb"/>killed the king. After that Vicitravīrya became king.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma had to take up the task of arranging a suitable
<div n="lb"/>marriage for Vicitravīrya.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The Svayaṃvara.%} It was at this time that Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>came to know that the King of Kāśī was arranging the
<div n="lb"/>Svayaṃvara of his three daughters, Ambā, Ambikā and
<div n="lb"/>Ambālikā. Bhīṣma went there and in the presence of all
<div n="lb"/>the kings who had assembled there, took the three
<div n="lb"/>princesses with him to Hastināpura. There he made all
<div n="lb"/>preparations for the marriage. But as the time for the
<div n="lb"/>ceremony approached, the eldest and most beautiful of
<div n="lb"/>the princesses, Ambā went to Bhīṣma and said: “I had
<div n="lb"/>already made up my mind long ago to marry Sālva, the
<div n="lb"/>King. Besides, we are deeply in love with each other.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, please consider whether it is proper on the
<div n="lb"/>part of a great man like you to force me into another
<div n="lb"/>marriage.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Bhīṣma allowed her to do as she liked.
<div n="lb"/>Ambā then went to King Sālva and made an appeal to
<div n="lb"/>him to accept her as his wife since they were mutually
<div n="lb"/>in love.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sālva's rejection.%} To her words Sālva replied:
<div n="lb"/>“What you have said about our mutual love is true. But
<div n="lb"/>it is not right for a man to accept a woman who has been
<div n="lb"/>accepted by another. I saw Bhīṣma taking you by hand
<div n="lb"/>and helping you into his chariot. Therefore go at once
<div n="lb"/>to Bhīṣma himself and ask him to accept you.” Stunned
<div n="lb"/>by his words, she turned away, to go to the forest to do
<div n="lb"/>penance.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Revenge on Bhīṣma.%} In the Mahābhārata, Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 17, we find that Ambā had cherished a
<div n="lb"/>secret desire to wreak vengeance on Bhīṣma. She went to
<div n="lb"/>the Āśrama of Śaikhāvatya Muni in the forest and stayed
<div n="lb"/>there for the night. Her wish to do penance was approv-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the Muni. On the next day, Ambā's maternal
<div n="lb"/>grandfather, Hotravāhana (Sṛñjaya) came that way.
<div n="lb"/>Hotravāhana came to know of all her misfortunes. He
<div n="lb"/>advised her to inform Paraśurāma of all her grievances.
<div n="lb"/>Just at that moment Akṛtavraṇa, a follower of Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma happened to come there. Hotravāhana introduced
<div n="lb"/>Ambā to Akṛtavraṇa. Both Akṛtavraṇa and Sṛñjaya
<div n="lb"/>explained all her affairs to Paraśurāma. Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>undertook to persuade Bhīṣma to accept Ambā (as his
<div n="lb"/>wife). But Paraśurāma's proposal was turned down by
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma. A terrible duel took place between them at
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra. When the fight reached a critical stage,
<div n="lb"/>Nārada and the gods induced Paraśurāma to withdraw
<div n="lb"/>from the duel. Thus the fight ended with equal victory
<div n="lb"/>to both. Finding that it was not possible to achieve her
<div n="lb"/>object through Paraśurāma's mediation, Ambā re-
<div n="lb"/>nounced food, sleep etc. and went to the Yamunā valley
<div n="lb"/>to do penance for six years. (M.B., Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 188). After that for one year she went on a
<div n="lb"/>fast, lying under the water in the river Yamunā. Again
<div n="lb"/>for another year she did penance, standing on the tip of
<div n="lb"/>the toes and eating only dry leaves. Next, she reduced
<div n="lb"/>the sky and earth to flames by doing penance. The
<div n="lb"/>goddess Gaṅgā appeared to her and when she under-
<div n="lb"/>stood her plight, she told Ambā that it was not possible
<div n="lb"/>to kill Bhīṣma. In her agony and despair, without even
<div n="lb"/>drinking water, she wandered about here and there.
<div n="lb"/>The goddess Gangā cursed her to become a river in the
<div n="lb"/>Vatsa country. As a result of the curse, a part of her was
<div n="lb"/>turned into the river known as Ambā.
[Page028-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Śiva's Boon.%} The remaining part of her engaged
<div n="lb"/>itself in penance. Śiva appeared to her and told her that
<div n="lb"/>in the next birth she would attain masculinity. He added
<div n="lb"/>that she would be born in the Drupada dynasty as a
<div n="lb"/>great archer under the name of Citrayodhi and kill
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma. Pleased with this prophecy, she took a vow that
<div n="lb"/>she would kill Bhīṣma and making a pyre, burnt herself
<div n="lb"/>to death.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Rebirth.%} King Drupada's queen had been in great
<div n="lb"/>distress for a long time because she had no children.
<div n="lb"/>Drupada propitiated Śiva by worshipping him for an
<div n="lb"/>issue. Śiva blessed him and said that a girl would be
<div n="lb"/>born to him, but she would be transformed into a boy.
<div n="lb"/>In due course, the queen gave birth to a girl, but it was
<div n="lb"/>announced that it was a boy. Therefore the child had to
<div n="lb"/>be brought up, dressed like a boy. The child became
<div n="lb"/>famous under the name of Śikhaṇḍī. When Śikhaṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>attained youth, Drupada decided to look for a wife for
<div n="lb"/>him (her?). Still he was greatly perplexed as to how to
<div n="lb"/>find a wife for Śikhaṇḍī who was already a youthful
<div n="lb"/>virgin! But his wife assured Drupada that Sikhaṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>would become a man, according to Śiva's blessing. So,
<div n="lb"/>Drupada made a proposal for Śikhaṇḍī's marriage with
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of the King of Daśārṇa.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Śikhaṇḍī's Marriage.%} Hiraṇyavarṇa, the King of
<div n="lb"/>Daśārṇa, gave his daughter in marriage to Śikhaṇḍī.
<div n="lb"/>The couple arrived at Kāmbalyapura. By this time the
<div n="lb"/>wife came to know that the “husband” was a woman.
<div n="lb"/>She disclosed the secret to her Ladies-in-waiting. They
<div n="lb"/>in turn communicated it to the king. Enraged at this,
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyavarṇa sent a messenger to King Drupada to
<div n="lb"/>ascertain the truth of the matter. He even began to
<div n="lb"/>make preparations for waging a war against Drupada,
<div n="lb"/>King of Pañcāla. Drupada and his queen were in a fix.
<div n="lb"/>At this stage the distressed Śikhaṇḍī proceeded to the
<div n="lb"/>forest, determined to commit suicide. People were
<div n="lb"/>afraid of entering that forest because a Yakṣa named
<div n="lb"/>Sthūṇakarṇa lived there. Śikhaṇḍī went to the premises
<div n="lb"/>of the Yakṣa and performed certain rites for a number of
<div n="lb"/>days. The Yakṣa appeared to her. Śikhaṇḍī explained
<div n="lb"/>the whole matter to him. They entered into a contract.
<div n="lb"/>According to it, they exchanged their sexes—Śikhaṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>receiving the male sex of the Yakṣa and the Yakṣa receiv-
<div n="lb"/>ing the female sex of Śikhaṇḍī. Śikhaṇḍī returned home
<div n="lb"/>as a man. Drupada repeated with greater force his old
<div n="lb"/>plea that his child was a man. Hiraṇyavarṇa made a
<div n="lb"/>thorough examination of Śikhaṇḍī and convinced him-
<div n="lb"/>self of the truth. Many years after, Hiraṇyavarṇa died.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kubera's Arrival.%} At that time, in the course of his
<div n="lb"/>world tour Kubera arrived at the residence of Sthūṇa-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa. The Yakṣa who was in female form, did not
<div n="lb"/>come out to receive Kubera. In his anger, Kubera
<div n="lb"/>pronounced a curse that the female sex of Sthūṇakarṇa
<div n="lb"/>and the male sex of Śikhaṇḍī would continue for ever.
<div n="lb"/>The Yakṣa prayed for the lifting of the curse. Kubera
<div n="lb"/>released him from the curse by saying that after the
<div n="lb"/>death of Śikhaṇḍī, the Yakṣa would be restored to his
<div n="lb"/>own male sex.
<div n="NI"/>According to the previous agreement, Śikhaṇḍī went to
<div n="lb"/>Sthūṇakarṇa's place after the death of Hiraṇyavarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>But coming to know of all that had happened, he return-
<div n="lb"/>ed home. Thus Śikhaṇḍī became a man permanently.
<div n="lb"/>Śikhaṇḍī had received his training in arms under Droṇā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya. In the great Kaurava-Pāṇḍava battle, he became
<div n="lb"/>a charioteer.
[Page029-a+ 61]
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śikhaṇḍī's Revenge.%} The Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 108, describes Bhīṣma's encounter with
<div n="lb"/>Śikhaṇḍī during the Kaurava-Pāṇḍava battle. The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas started the day's battle by keeping Śikhaṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>in the vanguard. Bhīma, Arjuna, Abhimanyu and other
<div n="lb"/>warriors were giving him support. It was Bhīṣma who
<div n="lb"/>led the Kaurava forces. Arrows began to fly from both
<div n="lb"/>sides. It was the tenth day of the battle and Śikhaṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>shot three arrows aimed at Bhīṣma's breast. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>with a smile of contempt said to Śikhaṇḍī, “Śikhaṇḍī!
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā created you as a woman. You may do as you
<div n="lb"/>like”. Hearing this taunt, Śikhaṇḍī became more in-
<div n="lb"/>furiated. Arjuna inspired him with greater courage.
<div n="lb"/>After that, keeping Śikhaṇḍī in front, Arjuna began to
<div n="lb"/>fight with Bhīṣma. Śikhaṇḍī also showered his arrows
<div n="lb"/>on him. Ten of these arrows of Śikhaṇḍī hit Bhīṣma's
<div n="lb"/>breast. Bhīṣma disregarded even those arrows. At last
<div n="lb"/>he said: “I cannot kill the Pāṇḍavas because they are
<div n="lb"/>invulnerable (avadhyāḥ). I cannot kill Śikhaṇḍī be-
<div n="lb"/>cause he is really a woman and not man. Though I am
<div n="lb"/>also invulnerable and cannot be killed in battle, yet
<div n="lb"/>today I have to die; the time has come for me to die.”
<div n="lb"/>Meanwhile Śikhaṇḍī and Arjuna were discharging a
<div n="lb"/>continuous and heavy shower of arrows at Bhīṣma. At
<div n="lb"/>last Bhīṣma fell down. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>173).
