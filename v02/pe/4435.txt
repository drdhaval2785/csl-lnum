MATAṄGA I¦. An ancient sage. The Rāmāyaṇa in
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Kāṇḍa describes the āśrama of Mataṅga.
<div n="lb"/>Rāmalakṣmaṇas after crossing the forest of Krauñca
<div n="lb"/>came to the āśrama of Mataṅga. Kabandha was slain
<div n="lb"/>at this place After abandoning his demoniac body
<div n="lb"/>Kabandha extolled the greatness of Mataṅgāśrama
<div n="lb"/>to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. “The flowers of this āśrama
<div n="lb"/>are never plucked and worn on heads. Even if they are
<div n="lb"/>not plucked they never fade. They remain fresh always.
<div n="lb"/>There is a reason for this. The disciples of Mataṅga
<div n="lb"/>once brought a heavy load of fruits for their guru and
<div n="lb"/>when they reached the āśrama they were tired and
<div n="lb"/>drops of perspiration fell on the plants and they became
<div n="lb"/>flowers. Śabarī is performing penance in this aśrama.”
<div n="lb"/>Mataṅga once cursed Bāli. It happened that while the
<div n="lb"/>sage was living on the mountain of Ṛṣyamūka Bāli and
<div n="lb"/>the asura Dundubhi fought against each other and
<div n="lb"/>blood flowing from the body of Dundubhi by a blow
<div n="lb"/>of Bāli spurted out and fell on the hands of the sage.
[Page493-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Mataṅga then cursed Bāli saying that his head would
<div n="lb"/>blow off if he entered Ṛṣyamūkācala again. (Sarga 46,
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa and Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrva Kāṇḍa). Mataṅgāśrama was a holy
<div n="lb"/>place. (Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
