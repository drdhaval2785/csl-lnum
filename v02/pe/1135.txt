BHĪMA VI¦. A Śūdra who attained Svarga as on his head
<div n="lb"/>fell water with which the feet of a brahmin were washed.
<div n="lb"/>The following story about him occurs on page 619 of
<div n="lb"/>the Padmapurāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>In the dvāpara yuga there lived a Śūdra called Bhīma,
<div n="lb"/>who engaged himself in the profession of Vaiśyas. An
<div n="lb"/>outcaste from practices pertaining to Śūdras he enjoyed
<div n="lb"/>life with a Vaiśya woman. He was a terrible fellow, who
<div n="lb"/>had killed many brahmins, and also enjoyed the wives
<div n="lb"/>of many elderly people including his teachers. He was
<div n="lb"/>a robber as well. Once he went to a brahmin house,
<div n="lb"/>and with the object of robbing his wealth spoke to him
<div n="lb"/>in a pathetic tone as follows:—“Respected sire, you
<div n="lb"/>will please listen to my grievance. You appear to be kind-
<div n="lb"/>hearted. Please give me some rice, or else I will die this
<div n="lb"/>very moment.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmin:—“Oh hungry guest! There is no one here
<div n="lb"/>to cook food. I shall give you daily some rice, which
<div n="lb"/>you may cook yourself. I have neither father, mother,
<div n="lb"/>son, brothers, wife nor any other relatives. All of them
<div n="lb"/>are dead and gone. The unfortunate fellow that I am,
<div n="lb"/>I am staying here alone. No servants or others here.”
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma:—“Oh revered brahmin! I too am a lonely
<div n="lb"/>person. I shall live here for ever serving you. I am a
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra.”
<div n="NI"/>These words of Bhīma pleased the brahmin so much that
<div n="lb"/>he cooked some food quickly and served the Śūdra with
<div n="lb"/>it. He stayed with the brahmin from that day onwards.
<div n="lb"/>His idea was to rob the brahmin of his wealth at some
<div n="lb"/>convenient time and get away. But, since he used to
<div n="lb"/>pour on his head everyday the water with which the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin's feet were washed he got redemption from all
<div n="lb"/>his sins.
<div n="NI"/>One night a thief got into the brahmin's room to steal his
<div n="lb"/>earnings. Seeing the thief Bhīma rushed at him to give
<div n="lb"/>him a good thrashing. But, the thief, in the twinkling
<div n="lb"/>of an eye, cut off Bhīma's head and escaped from the
<div n="lb"/>scene. At once there came down the attendants of Lord
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu to lead Bhīma to Vaikuṇṭha. A divine chariot
<div n="lb"/>drawn by Rājahaṃsas (swans) also came down. Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>got into the chariot and reached the abode of Viṣṇu.
