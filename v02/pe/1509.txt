CĀTURVARṆYAM¦. (The four Castes, Classes).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The purāṇas tell that Brahmā created the
<div n="lb"/>four castes like Brahmins, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras
<div n="lb"/>and assigned to them duties and rules of procedure.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} Brahmā got ready for the work of Crea-
<div n="lb"/>tion, concentrating his mind on the universal soul, the
<div n="lb"/>embodiment of Truth. And, the first to be born from his
<div n="lb"/>face were people with sublime qualities, and them he
<div n="lb"/>called Brahmins. Then emerged from his chest people
<div n="lb"/>in whom the heroic or militant qualities preponderated.
<div n="lb"/>(Rājasa). Them the Creator named Kṣatriyas. Then
<div n="lb"/>from his thighs were born people in whom rajas and
<div n="lb"/>tamas preponderated, and they were called Vaiśyas.
<div n="lb"/>And, lastly Brahmā brought forth from his feet another
<div n="lb"/>sect of people, and as tamas (darkness, cultural darkness)
<div n="lb"/>preponderated in them they were named Śūdras. The
<div n="lb"/>system of four castes is called Cāturvarṇyam. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Code of conduct.%} Ahiṃsā (non-violence), Satyavāda
<div n="lb"/>(speaking truth), Bhūtadāya (love for all living beings),
<div n="lb"/>Tīrthasevā (resort to holy places), Dāna (gifts), Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>carya (celibacy), Vimatsaratva (absence of malice),
<div n="lb"/>Service of Devas, Brahmins and Gurus (elders), to attend
<div n="lb"/>to all dharmas (duties), Pitṛpūjā (worship of elders)
<div n="lb"/>eternal loyalty to King, to accomplish objects in con-
<div n="lb"/>formity with the injunction of the Śāstras, not to commit
<div n="lb"/>cruel deeds, Titikṣā (forbearance, to put up with
<div n="lb"/>equanimity the pair of opposites such as pleasure and
<div n="lb"/>pain, heat and cold), belief in God—these codes of con-
<div n="lb"/>duct are common to all Castes and in all the four stations
<div n="lb"/>in life. Now, the special codes for each of the four
<div n="lb"/>castes.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Brahmins.%} To perform and get performed Yajñas,
<div n="lb"/>to study and to teach the Vedas, to give gifts and to
<div n="lb"/>receive gifts—these form the dharma (duties) of the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin. Brahmins take their second birth (dvija)
<div n="lb"/>on the upanayana (wearing of the sacred thread).
<div n="lb"/>The caste of the mother is the caste of the child. But
<div n="lb"/>children born to Brahmins of their non-Brahmin wives
<div n="lb"/>are not Brahmins. Children born of a Brahmin woman
<div n="lb"/>to a Śūdrā are called Caṇḍālas. Sons born of Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>women to Kṣatriyas are called Sūtas, and sons born of a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin woman to a Vaiśya are called Vaidehikas.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmin shall not adopt the profession of the other
<div n="lb"/>castes. The twice-born are, however, allowed in certain
<div n="lb"/>circumstances, the profession of agriculture, protection
<div n="lb"/>of cows, commerce and kusīda (to lend money on inte-
<div n="lb"/>rest). But, he shall not trade in gorasa (milk and other
<div n="lb"/>cow products) lavaṇa (salt) and flesh. If he be an
<div n="lb"/>agriculturist, the Brahmin may till the earth, cut medi-
<div n="lb"/>cinal plants and destroy pests. But, he must purify the
<div n="lb"/>soul by performing yajñas and worshipping Devas.
<div n="lb"/>The soil should be ploughed with eight oxen attached to
<div n="lb"/>the plough. He may sustain himself either with Ṛta
<div n="lb"/>(food got by begging) or Amṛta (food got not by beg-
<div n="lb"/>ging). The suffix “Śarmā” should be added to the names
[Page180-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmin children. Upanayana (wearing of the sacred
<div n="lb"/>thread) should be done when the child is eight years
<div n="lb"/>old. The mauñji (girdle around the waist) to be worn
<div n="lb"/>after upanayana should be made either of muñja grass
<div n="lb"/>or of the bark of trees. Brahmin brahmacārins should
<div n="lb"/>wear hides, and when they beg for alms the sentence
<div n="lb"/>should commence with the word ‘Bhavati’, e.g. “Bhavati,
<div n="lb"/>bhikṣāṃ dehi). The Brahmin can marry in all the castes,
<div n="lb"/>but he shall perform ritual only along with the wife of
<div n="lb"/>his own caste.
<div n="NI"/>{%ii) Kṣatriya.%} To give gifts according to rules, study
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and perform yajñas form the duty of the Kṣatriya.
<div n="lb"/>To look after and take care of good people and to punish
<div n="lb"/>evil-doers are his especial duties. Names of Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>children should take the suffix “Varmā”. After upana-
<div n="lb"/>yana the child should wear tiger skin. He should carry
<div n="lb"/>a daṇḍa (rod) of the Arayāl (peepal) tree. When the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya brahmacārin begs for alms the word ‘bhavati’
<div n="lb"/>should be used in the middle of the sentence, e.g. “Bhikṣāṃ
<div n="lb"/>bhavati dehi”. The Kṣatriya can marry in the other
<div n="lb"/>castes, except the Brahmin. At the time of wedding the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya woman should hold an arrow in her hand.
<div n="NI"/>{%iii) Vaiśya.%} Agriculture, protection of cows and trade
<div n="lb"/>are the special duties of the Vaiśya. Children born of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin women to Vaiśyas are called Vaidehikas.
<div n="lb"/>Names of Vaiśya children should have the suffix ‘gupta’
<div n="lb"/>after them. After upanayana the Vaiśya brahmacārin
<div n="lb"/>should wear sheep's skin. He should carry a daṇḍa made
<div n="lb"/>of a branch of the Kūvala tree. The Vaiśya may have a
<div n="lb"/>wife of his own caste and one of the Śūdra caste. At
<div n="lb"/>the time of wedding the Vaiśya woman should hold a
<div n="lb"/>cane in her hand.
<div n="NI"/>{%iv) Śūdra.%} Service to the Brahmin and architecture
<div n="lb"/>form the duties of the Śūdra. Children born to Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>women by Śūdras are called Pulkasas. Children born
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmin women by Śūdras are called Caṇḍālas,
<div n="lb"/>and sons born to Śūdras by Vaiśya women are called
<div n="lb"/>Āyogavas.
<div n="NI"/>The Caṇḍāla's profession is to hang criminals sentenced
<div n="lb"/>to death, and to live by women. The Pulkasa must
<div n="lb"/>live by hunting. Āyogava is to act on the stage and live
<div n="lb"/>by architecture. The Caṇḍāla should live outside the
<div n="lb"/>village. The Caṇḍāla has a right to take the clothes on
<div n="lb"/>corpses. He shall not have any physical contacts with
<div n="lb"/>the others. He will attain salvation if he died in the
<div n="lb"/>course of protecting others. The suffix ‘dāsa’ should be
<div n="lb"/>added to his name. He shall marry only from his own
<div n="lb"/>caste. (Agni Purāṇa, 4 Chapters from 151).
