LIPI¦ (ALPHABET, SCRIPT).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Lipi is the record in writing of the utteran-
<div n="lb"/>ces by mouth. There are scientific and non-scientific
<div n="lb"/>statements about the origin of lipi. In the beginning
<div n="lb"/>people used figures of objects to express their ideas.
<div n="lb"/>They were called pictorial writings and are found even
<div n="lb"/>now in caves in Spain and France where the aborigines
<div n="lb"/>lived. Gradually the pictures vanished and letters took
<div n="lb"/>their place.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ancient conception.%} Purāṇas give a different ver-
<div n="lb"/>sion. People of Java believe that the script origi-
<div n="lb"/>nated from Java. The voice of Indonesia, a government
<div n="lb"/>organ, published once a purāṇic story relating to the
<div n="lb"/>origin of the script. Lipi came into being in 78 A.D.
<div n="lb"/>Ajaśikha, a saint among the Buddhists, was the originator
<div n="lb"/>of the lipi. He had two disciples named Dora and
<div n="lb"/>Sempādā. All the three went and stayed in a village in
<div n="lb"/>the valley of the mountains of Konṭaṅg. The country
<div n="lb"/>of Menrāṅgkāmanāl was then ruled by a King called
<div n="lb"/>Baka. Ajaśikha heard about this wicked King who had
<div n="lb"/>ordered one of his subjects to go to him daily for his
<div n="lb"/>food. The people were worried. They tried in secret to
<div n="lb"/>find out someone to subdue this tyrant. One day they
<div n="lb"/>approached Ajaśikha and requested him to find out a
<div n="lb"/>way to get relief from this cruel King. Ajaśikha sent
<div n="lb"/>them back promising to do something to help them.
<div n="NI"/>Ajaśikha sat in meditation for some time and then told
<div n="lb"/>his disciples thus:— “I have decided to help the people
<div n="lb"/>of Menrāṅgkāmanāl. Dora also should come with me.
<div n="lb"/>Sempādā should stay here keeping guard over my
<div n="lb"/>sword and clothes. Never give them to anybody but
<div n="lb"/>me. You should be prepared to give your life for it.”
<div n="NI"/>Ajaśikha and Dora went to see Baka. People discourag-
<div n="lb"/>ed them and advised them not to go to the King. But
<div n="lb"/>they did not heed that and straight away went to the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Baka. Baka started to kill them but then
<div n="lb"/>Ajaśikha said, “Oh King, you can eat me tomorrow.
<div n="lb"/>In return please give me today land as big as my
<div n="lb"/>headwear”. Baka agreed to that and Ajaśikha spread
<div n="lb"/>his clothes on the ground. As Baka looked with wonder
<div n="lb"/>that small piece of headwear began to grow big and it
<div n="lb"/>grew in size to cover the whole of the country.
<div n="lb"/>Baka got furious at this and attacked Ajaśikha. But
<div n="lb"/>Baka was slain in the duel.
<div n="NI"/>The people burst into joy and made Ajaśikha their
<div n="lb"/>King. Ajaśikha then sent Dora to his āśrama to fetch
<div n="lb"/>his sword and apparels, little thinking of the instructions
<div n="lb"/>he had given to Sempādā. Dora went and asked for the
<div n="lb"/>sword and apparel. But Sempādā did not give and a
<div n="lb"/>fight ensued in which both were killed.
<div n="NI"/>Ajaśikha felt very sorry when he heard about the death
<div n="lb"/>of his disciples. He cursed himself for giving contra-
<div n="lb"/>dictory orders to his disciples and so wrote four lines,
<div n="lb"/>each containing five letters, to keep alive the memory
<div n="lb"/>of his dutiful disciples. Those twenty letters are the
<div n="lb"/>first ones written not only in Java but the whole world.
<div n="lb"/>They were the following:
<div n="NI"/>He no co ro ko—There were two disciples.
<div n="NI"/>Ṭo to so vo lo—They became enemies because they
<div n="lb"/>obeyed the orders of their guru.
<div n="NI"/>Po dho jo yo ñjo—Both of them were brave men.
<div n="NI"/>Mo go bo do ṅgo—Both of them died.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhārata lipis.%} Different kinds of lipis were prevalent
<div n="lb"/>in ancient Bhārata. Lalitavistara mentions about sixty-
[Page454-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>four kinds of lipis in Bhārata during the time of Buddha.
<div n="lb"/>From inscriptions on stones and other historical records
<div n="lb"/>it can be gathered that the basis of all the lipis had been
<div n="lb"/>two main lipis named Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭrī. Kharoṣṭrī
<div n="lb"/>was used in the northwest of Bhārata and became extinct
<div n="lb"/>by the 4th Century A.D. Brāhmī was the lipi universally
<div n="lb"/>used in Bhārata. This lipi had different forms in the
<div n="lb"/>north and south. The lipi in use in the south was called
<div n="lb"/>Drāviḍī.
<div n="NI"/>Kharoṣtī lipi was written from right to left and the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmī from left to right. Even the Brāhmī was written
<div n="lb"/>first from right to left and gradually for the convenience
<div n="lb"/>of writing it was changed to one from left to right.
<div n="NI"/>Linguists consider Brāhmī lipi as the base of all the
<div n="lb"/>lipis of Bhārata. It underwent changes in different
<div n="lb"/>parts and took different names. The scholars of Europe
<div n="lb"/>are of opinion that the Brāhmī lipi was borrowed from
<div n="lb"/>foreign traders in B.C. 800. Others say that the Brāhmī
<div n="lb"/>lipi was born out of the pictorial lipi of the Chinese.
<div n="lb"/>There are those who say that the Brāhmī lipi originated
<div n="lb"/>in Greece and Phoenicia. The great linguist Bulhar
<div n="lb"/>says that the Brāhmī lipi came from the Semitic
<div n="lb"/>languages. But Lassen and Cunningham refuted it.
<div n="NI"/>There is a bundle of leaves in the hand of the idol of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā in the temple of Bādāmi. Hindus believe that
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmī lipi found in those leaves was written by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā himself. The Aryans forgot that lipi and Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>found it out. This is a statement by the Arab traveller
<div n="lb"/>Albarūni who came to India in the 11th century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kerala Lipi.%} The Brāhmī lipi came to south India
<div n="lb"/>by the 3rd century A.D. Many scholars on languages
<div n="lb"/>say that ‘Veṭṭeluttu’ is a changed form of the Brāhmī
<div n="lb"/>lipi. The great lipi expert L.A. Ravi Varma says that
<div n="lb"/>‘Eluttu’ has come from the word ‘Elu’ or ‘Alu’ meaning
<div n="lb"/>‘to mark by cuts’. The common method of writing in
<div n="lb"/>South India was to use a pointed stick, long metal nail
<div n="lb"/>or chisel to make marks on leaves, rocks or copper
<div n="lb"/>plates. Writing by making marks with the pointed
<div n="lb"/>stick (Kol) got the name ‘Koleluttu’. Veṭṭeluttu,
<div n="lb"/>Koleluttu and Malayāṇma were the three lipis in use
<div n="lb"/>in Kerala. Veṭṭeluttu was in vogue in Tamilnāḍu also.
<div n="lb"/>But the Pallavas who were using Prākṛta language when
<div n="lb"/>they conquered the northern Tamilnad introduced
<div n="lb"/>Granthākṣara and Granthatamil there. T.K.Krishna
<div n="lb"/>Menon says that Granthākṣara was a false creation to
<div n="lb"/>write Sanskrit easily. In Pāṇḍyadeśa and Malanāḍu
<div n="lb"/>Veṭṭeluttu was in use even then.
<div n="NI"/>The influence of the Pallavas began to wane and the
<div n="lb"/>Tamil lipi slowly rose into prominence. Even then
<div n="lb"/>Veṭṭeluttu was in vogue in the empire of Cera com-
<div n="lb"/>prising of Malanāḍu, Mysore. Coimbatore, Salem and
<div n="lb"/>Toṇḍamaṇḍalam. When Tamilnadu came under the
<div n="lb"/>emperor of Vijayanagara those kings introduced Nāgarī
<div n="lb"/>lipi there.
<div n="NI"/>Veṭṭeluttu was called Nānam Monam also. In the south
<div n="lb"/>instead of using ‘Hari Śrī’ people used to say ‘Namo-
<div n="lb"/>nārāyaṇāya’ and the first syllable ‘Na’ and the second
<div n="lb"/>one ‘Mo’ were used to name the language ‘Nānam
<div n="lb"/>Monam’.
<div n="NI"/>When the Malayālis started liking the Maṇipravāla
<div n="lb"/>they started using ‘Ārya eluttu’ a form of Granthalipi.
<div n="lb"/>This script was known as Tulu-Malayālam also. This
<div n="lb"/>was also born of the Brāhmīlipi. Gradually Veṭṭeluttu
<div n="lb"/>and Koleluttu was in use in the north of Kerala among
<div n="lb"/>Muslims. The Alphabets now in use by the different
[Page455-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>languages of south India took shape only about two
<div n="lb"/>centuries ago. The lipi of Malayālam now in use came
<div n="lb"/>into shape by the time of Eluttaśśan spreading the
<div n="lb"/>belief that it was Eluttaśśan who had made the
<div n="lb"/>alphabet. It is wise to believe that the Malayālam
<div n="lb"/>script came into use gradually from Ārya eluttu than to
<div n="lb"/>give credit to one individual for its origin.
