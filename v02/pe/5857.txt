RUṢAṄGU¦. An ancient hermit. Once the great
<div n="lb"/>hermit Ārṣṭiṣeṇa came to the hermitage of Ruṣaṅgu and
<div n="lb"/>did severe penance. Viśvāmitra obtained Brāhmaṇatva
<div n="lb"/>(Brahminhood) by doing penance in this place. To-
<div n="lb"/>wards the end of his life Ruṣaṅgu and his sons came to
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthūdakatīrtha and sang laudatory songs about
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthūdakatīrtha. Ruṣaṅgu said that those who did
<div n="lb"/>penance and died in this holy bath would not have to
<div n="lb"/>undergo miseries after death. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 39, Stanza 24).
