CIRADĀTĀ¦. There was a king called Ciradātā in the
<div n="lb"/>country called Cirapura. Though himself a good man he
<div n="lb"/>was surrounded by bad advisers. Once a foreigner,
<div n="lb"/>Prasaṅga, came along with two friends to the palace to
<div n="lb"/>see the King. But due to the bad advice of his courtiers
<div n="lb"/>the King did not care to see them even. For five years
<div n="lb"/>they stayed there without even getting a look at the
<div n="lb"/>King. One day the only son of the King died. All the
<div n="lb"/>courtiers gathered round the child and pretended to
<div n="lb"/>be greatly grieved. Prasaṅga and his friends also came
<div n="lb"/>to the scene. They saw the king and spoke to him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“For five years you have not cared either to see or talk to
<div n="lb"/>us. We were cherishing a hope that at least your son
<div n="lb"/>would give us a better treatment when he grew old and
<div n="lb"/>became King. We were living here on that hope and now
<div n="lb"/>that hope also has been shattered and so we are leaving
<div n="lb"/>the place this instant.” The King was surprised to hear
<div n="lb"/>that they were prepared even to wait for his son to
<div n="lb"/>become the King and gave them very many presents.
