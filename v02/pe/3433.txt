KAUŚIKA VI¦. A hermit. This ancient hermit lived in
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra. His sons Svasṛpa, Krodhana, Hiṃsra,
<div n="lb"/>Piśuna, Kavi, Vāgduṣṭa, and Pitṛvarttī lived with
<div n="lb"/>hermit Garga for learning under him. Their names
<div n="lb"/>indicated their character. Their father died. The sons
<div n="lb"/>were in poverty. At this time rain ceased altogether.
<div n="lb"/>Garga asked his disciples to take his milch cow to the
<div n="lb"/>forest for grazing. Owing to hunger the brothers decid-
<div n="lb"/>ed to kill and eat the cow. But the youngest said: “If
<div n="lb"/>you are bent on killing the cow, we had better make
<div n="lb"/>use of it as an offering to the Manes, and no sin will
<div n="lb"/>visit us.”
<div n="NI"/>All agreed to this and Pitṛvarttī killed the cow and
<div n="lb"/>began the sacrifice. Two elder brothers were employed
<div n="lb"/>in worshipping the gods and three were detailed to give
<div n="lb"/>offerings to the manes. One was asked to be the guest.
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛvarttī was the sacrificer. Remembering the
<div n="lb"/>ancestors with reverence he began the sacrifice in
<div n="lb"/>accordance with the rites. Thus the seven hermits ate
<div n="lb"/>the cow and told Garga that the cow was caught by a
<div n="lb"/>tiger.
<div n="NI"/>In due course the seven of them died, and took rebirth
<div n="lb"/>as rude low-caste people in Dāśapura. Because of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice and offerings to the Manes they had the
<div n="lb"/>remembrance of their previous birth. So they feared
<div n="lb"/>god and took fast and vow at a holy bath and in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of a multitude cast off their lives and were
<div n="lb"/>born again as animals in Kālañjara hills. Because of
<div n="lb"/>their abstinence due to knowledge they cast off their
<div n="lb"/>lives by Prapatana (jumping down from the top of the
<div n="lb"/>mountain) and were born again as Ruddy geese, in the
<div n="lb"/>Mānasasaras when their names were Sumanas, Kusuma,
<div n="lb"/>Vasu, Citradarśī, Sudarśī, Jñātā and Jñānapāraga—
<div n="lb"/>names conforming to their character. The seven brothers
<div n="lb"/>became pure and sinless by their union with God the
[Page401-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Spirit. But three of them fell out of the union
<div n="lb"/>because of their desire. They saw the pleasurable life
<div n="lb"/>led by Aṇuha the King of Pāñcāla who was immensely
<div n="lb"/>wealthy with many beautiful wives. At the sight of this,
<div n="lb"/>one of the geese—the Brahmin Pitṛvartti, who performed
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice of offering to the Manes because of his love
<div n="lb"/>for his father—wished to become a king. Seeing the two
<div n="lb"/>wealthy ministers who led luxurious lives, two of the
<div n="lb"/>ruddy geese wanted to become ministers. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛvartti was born as Brahmadatta the son of Vaibh-
<div n="lb"/>rāja and the other two as sons of ministers with names
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍarīka and Subālaka. Brahmadatta was anointed
<div n="lb"/>as King of Pāñcāla in the great city of Kāmpilya. That
<div n="lb"/>King was mighty, loving his father well, always desirous
<div n="lb"/>of giving offerings to Manes and harmonious with God,
<div n="lb"/>having the ability to read the hearts of every living
<div n="lb"/>being. He married Sannati the daughter of Sudeva.
<div n="lb"/>This woman in her previous birth was the cow of
<div n="lb"/>Garga. As this cow was used as offering to the Manes
<div n="lb"/>she got rebirth as a religious-minded woman and be-
<div n="lb"/>came the queen of Brahmadatta, who ruled over the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom well for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>Once the King and the queen were walking in the
<div n="lb"/>garden when they saw two ants which were quarrelling
<div n="lb"/>with each other. They were husband and wife. After
<div n="lb"/>a time the quarrel ended and they grew more loving
<div n="lb"/>than before and the she-ant pressed closely against her
<div n="lb"/>husband. Brahmadatta hearing their conversation stood
<div n="lb"/>smiling. He could understand the language of every
<div n="lb"/>living being because of the merits of his previous births.
<div n="lb"/>When the King smiled his wife asked him for the rea-
<div n="lb"/>son. He described to his wife the quarrel of the ant-
<div n="lb"/>couple. The queen did not believe his words. She
<div n="lb"/>thought that the King had been making fun of her.
<div n="lb"/>She asked him how he learned the language of birds
<div n="lb"/>and beasts. But the King could not give an answer and
<div n="lb"/>he became thoughtful. The remaining four of the ruddy
<div n="lb"/>geese took rebirth as the sons of a poor Brahmin in the
<div n="lb"/>same city of Kāmpilya. They had the remembrance of
<div n="lb"/>previous births. Their names were Dhṛtimān, Sarva-
<div n="lb"/>darśī, Vidyācandra and Tapodhika, names befitting
<div n="lb"/>their character. They decided to perform severe penance
<div n="lb"/>to attain Supreme bliss, and were about to get away
<div n="lb"/>from the house when their father, the poor Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>cried bitterly, being helpless. They taught their father
<div n="lb"/>the following poem and advised him to recite the poem
<div n="lb"/>before the King the next morning, in order to get plenty
<div n="lb"/>of wealth.
<Poem>“Noble Brahmins in Kurukṣetra
<div n="lb"/>The seven foresters in Dāśapura
<div n="lb"/>Deer in Kālañjara and in Mānasa
<div n="lb"/>Ruddy geese, the same now are men.”</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>Brahmadatta who was not able to give answer to the
<div n="lb"/>question of his wife, was about to go out from the palace
<div n="lb"/>for a walk with his wife and ministers, when the old brah-
<div n="lb"/>min made his appearance and recited the poem taught
<div n="lb"/>by his sons, to the King. When the King heard the
<div n="lb"/>stanza he remembered the previous births and fainted
<div n="lb"/>and fell down. The two ministers, Subālaka son of
<div n="lb"/>Bābhravya the author of the science of love and Puṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>rīka son of Pāñcāla the author of the science of medicine
<div n="lb"/>and treatment, also remembered about their previous
<div n="lb"/>births and fell down with grief. The three of them
<div n="lb"/>lamented about their fall from the union with the Sup-
<div n="lb"/>reme Spirit. Brahmadatta gave that old Brahmin plenty
[Page401-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of wealth and villages and sent him away contented.
<div n="lb"/>After anointing his son Viṣvaksena as King, Brahmadatta
<div n="lb"/>and his retinue went to Mānasasaras for penance.
<div n="lb"/>For a while they lived in the forest engaged in penance
<div n="lb"/>and then cast off their lives and entered the world of
<div n="lb"/>Supreme bliss. (Padma Purāṇa, Part 3, Chapter 10).
