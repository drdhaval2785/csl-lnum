JAYANTĪ II¦. Daughter of Indra and sister of Jayanta.
<div n="lb"/>In Bhāgavata, Skandha 4, there is a story stating
<div n="lb"/>how Jayantī was the wife of Śukra for ten years.
<div n="NI"/>Śukrācārya was the teacher-priest of the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>(demons). Once the devas (gods) had completely de-
<div n="lb"/>feated the Asuras. With the intention of procuring
<div n="lb"/>new powers from Śrī Parameśvara, Śukrācārya went to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa. When the penance of Śukra became more
<div n="lb"/>and more severe the gods and Indra began to be
<div n="lb"/>flurried. Indra told his daughter Jayantī to become the
<div n="lb"/>servant of Śukra and to break his penance somehow or
<div n="lb"/>other. Jayantī did not like this procedure of her father.
<div n="lb"/>Still she did not like to disobey her father. So she
<div n="lb"/>went to Kailāsa and became the attendant of Śukra
<div n="lb"/>and stayed with him. She served him dutifully and
<div n="lb"/>with chastity. She would fan him with plantain leaf.
<div n="lb"/>She would prepare cold and fragrant water for him
<div n="lb"/>to drink. When the Sun became hotter she would hold
<div n="lb"/>her upper garment as an umbrella so that he should
<div n="lb"/>be in the shade. She would gather fully ripened good
<div n="lb"/>fruits for him to eat. She would gather good variety
<div n="lb"/>of darbha grass, cut them into the length of a span and
<div n="lb"/>with good flowers she would give them to the hermit
<div n="lb"/>for his morning oblations. She would gather soft
<div n="lb"/>sprouts and make bed for him and would stand near
<div n="lb"/>him fanning till he slept. She would get water ready
<div n="lb"/>for him to rinse his mouth when he woke up. Thus she
<div n="lb"/>did the work of a dutiful disciple. She did not, in any
<div n="lb"/>way by speech or action, try to entice him so that his
<div n="lb"/>vow of penance might be broken. She spoke only words
<div n="lb"/>which would be pleasing and helpful to him. This
<div n="lb"/>continued for thousand years and then Paramaśiva
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and gave the boons he requested
<div n="lb"/>for. After that Śukrācārya talked with her. In accor-
<div n="lb"/>dance with her request the hermit Śukra allowed her to
<div n="lb"/>live with him for ten years as his wife. He gave her a
<div n="lb"/>boon that during that period of ten years they both
<div n="lb"/>would be invisible to the world. Thus Śukrācārya
<div n="lb"/>married Jayantī and they lived in the house very happily
<div n="lb"/>for ten years.
