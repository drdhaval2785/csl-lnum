JAYAŚARMAN¦. A Brāhmaṇa who became wealthy by
<div n="lb"/>taking the vow of Kamalā (Kamalāvrata). Kamalā is
<div n="lb"/>the eleventh day of ‘Adhimāsa’.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that this day is better than other days. If
<div n="lb"/>a man fasts on that day Goddess Kamalā will be pleased
<div n="lb"/>with him.
<div n="NI"/>The devotee should awake in the Brāhma muhūrta
<div n="lb"/>(fortyeight minutes before sunrise) and take bath
<div n="lb"/>thinking of Puruṣottama and begin the fast. If the
<div n="lb"/>prayer and meditation is conducted at the house he
<div n="lb"/>will get double the fruits. If it is at a river it will
<div n="lb"/>yield four times the fruits. If it is at a cow-shed the
<div n="lb"/>fruits will be thousandfold and if it is conducted at
<div n="lb"/>a fireshed or Śaivite temple, at a holy bath or in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of God the fruits will be a thousand and one
<div n="lb"/>hundredfold and if it is near a tulasī (holy basil) the
<div n="lb"/>fruits will be a lakhfold and if it is done in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Viṣṇu the fruits obtained will be un-
<div n="lb"/>limited.
<div n="NI"/>This Jayaśarman who took the fast was the son of a
<div n="lb"/>noble Brāhmaṇa named Śivaśarman of Avantī. He was
<div n="lb"/>the youngest of five sons. He became a wicked man. So
<div n="lb"/>he was avoided by his relatives. Being driven away
<div n="lb"/>from home, he went to a distant forest and lived there.
<div n="lb"/>Once, by luck, he happened to reach the holy place of
<div n="lb"/>Triveṇī Mahātīrtha. He was very tired of hunger and
<div n="lb"/>thirst. So he bathed in the tīrtha and searched for some
<div n="lb"/>hermitage. By chance he saw the hermitage of Harimitra
<div n="lb"/>As it was the month of Puruṣottama many people had
<div n="lb"/>gathered there. Brāhmaṇas were telling stories of miti-
<div n="lb"/>gation of sins. He heard the story of the vow called
<div n="lb"/>Kamalāvrata and its fruits. So Jayaśarman stayed in that
<div n="lb"/>hermitage with them and took the vow of Kamalāvrata.
<div n="lb"/>That night Devī appeared before him and said: “I have
<div n="lb"/>come from Vaikuṇṭha, because I am greatly pleased with
<div n="lb"/>you. Since you have taken the vow of Kamalāvrata on
<div n="lb"/>the eleventh day of the dark lunar fortnight called
<div n="lb"/>Kamalā of the month of Puruṣottama I will grant you
<div n="lb"/>boons. Because you have taken the vow at Triveṇī, I am
<div n="lb"/>immensely pleased with you. The noble Brāhmaṇas of
<div n="lb"/>your future generations also will be blessed by me”.
<div n="lb"/>Saying these words the Devī gave him boons and dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared. From that day onwards Jayaśarmā became a
<div n="lb"/>great wealthy man and he returned to his father's house
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 64).
