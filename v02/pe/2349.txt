GARBHA¦(M). The Purāṇas have described the views
<div n="lb"/>of sages about the origin of ātman in woman's womb.
<div n="lb"/>Asitamahāmuni stated the following about the birth of
[Page279-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>a child to King Janaka. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa. Chapter
<div n="NI"/>48). Of the seven elements in the human body, viz.,
<div n="lb"/>Rasa, Rakta (blood), Māṃsa (flesh), Medas (fat),
<div n="lb"/>Asthi (bone), Majjā (marrow) and Śukla (seminal
<div n="lb"/>fluid) the last one, Śukla, is the most valuable. Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>bīja (the seed for production) is contained in Śukla.
<div n="lb"/>From the food we consume, blood and the seminal fluid
<div n="lb"/>take their nutrition. The Śukla emitted during coitus
<div n="lb"/>enters the womb of the woman propelled as it were by
<div n="lb"/>Kroṣṭavāyu. It takes only one night for the Śukla to
<div n="lb"/>get inextricably mixed with blood in the womb. In that
<div n="lb"/>mixing if the proportion of blood is higher, the child
<div n="lb"/>born will be girl, and if the proportion of Śukla is high-
<div n="lb"/>er, the offspring will be boy. If blood and Śukla are
<div n="lb"/>mixed exactly in equal proportions the child will be
<div n="lb"/>‘neutral’, neither girl nor boy. During the first month
<div n="lb"/>of pregnancy the child will be in liquid form. In the
<div n="lb"/>second, it solidifies due to the mixing and interplay of
<div n="lb"/>heat, cold, air, etc. During the third, holes for
<div n="lb"/>eye, ear, etc. become ready and the vein system is
<div n="lb"/>formed. In the fourth, head, hands and legs of the
<div n="lb"/>child are formed, and it is during this period that the
<div n="lb"/>prospective mother develops certain desires. If those
<div n="lb"/>desires are not satisfied the child may be born with
<div n="lb"/>physical deformities. During the fifth month the hips
<div n="lb"/>and bones develop. The various organs get firmer and
<div n="lb"/>stronger gradually and fingers appear during the sixth
<div n="lb"/>month. It is during the sixth month that hairs on the
<div n="lb"/>head and body appear and feelings and emotions ori-
<div n="lb"/>ginate in the mind. During the seventh month the ten
<div n="lb"/>vāyus (winds) on the basis of the nervous system are
<div n="lb"/>released, and the child experiences glimpses of its pre-
<div n="lb"/>vious existence, and ability to feel pain also is there.
<div n="lb"/>During the ninth month due to the force of the wind
<div n="lb"/>which effects actual delivery the child gets head down
<div n="lb"/>in the womb, and during the tenth month it emerges
<div n="lb"/>out of the womb. The child loses its memory about the
<div n="lb"/>past because of its contact with the female organ
<div n="lb"/>and external wind.
<div n="NI"/>According to the Agni Purāṇa the process is a little
<div n="lb"/>different:
<div n="NI"/>When Jīva (the soul) has entered the womb for rebirth
<div n="lb"/>it remains in fluid form during the first month. During
<div n="lb"/>the second month it solidifies; in the third month the
<div n="lb"/>organs begin to develop, in the fourth month skin,
<div n="lb"/>flesh and bones appear, in the fifth month hairs appear,
<div n="lb"/>in the sixth month mind is produced, in the seventh
<div n="lb"/>month the child will begin to feel pain. The body is
<div n="lb"/>covered by a skin (Garbhacarma) and both hands are
<div n="lb"/>held above the head in saluting position. If the child
<div n="lb"/>is a female it lies in the left side of the mother's womb,
<div n="lb"/>if a male on the right and if ‘neutral’ in the middle of
<div n="lb"/>it. From the seventh month the child begins to experi-
<div n="lb"/>ence the taste of foods consumed by the mother. During
<div n="lb"/>the eighth and ninth month there would be great
<div n="lb"/>emotional excitements and upsurges. If the mother
<div n="lb"/>suffered from chronic diseases the child also would in-
<div n="lb"/>herit it. When pregnancy is matured thus, certain
<div n="lb"/>winds lead the child down the womb and it gets out
<div n="lb"/>through the female organ.
<div n="NI"/>The child inherits its skin, flesh and heart from the
<div n="lb"/>mother. The sex organ, marrow, excretion, sweet and
<div n="lb"/>belly are inherited from the father. Head, the nervous
[Page280-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>system and śukla are the contributions of the ātman.
<div n="lb"/>(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 369).
