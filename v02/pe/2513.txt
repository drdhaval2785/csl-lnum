GREEK¦ LITERATURE. Greek is one of the most
<div n="lb"/>important Indo-European languages. As an indepen-
<div n="lb"/>dent branch of the original Indo-European language
<div n="lb"/>Greek established itself by about 2000 B.C. Even
<div n="lb"/>during its earliest period Greek had four local dialects
<div n="lb"/>as a result of the arrival of the Greek-speaking people
<div n="lb"/>at different periods of time. Iolic, Ionic-Attic, Arcado
<div n="lb"/>Cyprean and western Greek are the four dialects.
<div n="lb"/>Iolese was prevalent in the Lesbos region, and this is
<div n="lb"/>the dialect mainly used in the poetry of Homer. The
<div n="lb"/>Ionic and Attic dialects were prevalent in Ionia and
<div n="lb"/>Attica respectively. After Homer, the major portion of
<div n="lb"/>Greek literature was written in this dialect. The
<div n="lb"/>Arcado-Cyprean dialect was used in Arcadio and
<div n="lb"/>Cyprus. The fourth dialect was also called Doric.
<div n="NI"/>Naval traditions, commerce and political power con-
<div n="lb"/>tributed to the growth and development of Greek
<div n="lb"/>language and literature. In each dialect, even from the
<div n="lb"/>very beginning, literary efforts were made. Each of the
<div n="lb"/>four spoken languages very soon developed into a
<div n="lb"/>written language. But, in the very initial periods each
<div n="lb"/>of the spoken dialects continued its existence in the
<div n="lb"/>form of ballads and songs transferred from one man to
<div n="lb"/>another. It was Homer who gave those popular ballads
<div n="lb"/>an epic form and status and sowed the seeds of the
<div n="lb"/>great literature of Greece.
<div n="NI"/>The golden period of Greek literature was when the
<div n="lb"/>city of Athens enjoyed supreme political power.
<div n="lb"/>Literature during the period set the model for future
<div n="lb"/>generations. It was during this period that Greek
<div n="lb"/>achieved the best in different literary forms like tragedy,
<div n="lb"/>comedy, lyric, elegy, history, philosophy, oratory etc.
<div n="lb"/>Pindar, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Sophocles-Euripides,
<div n="lb"/>Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and Demosthenes—
<div n="lb"/>these are distinguished names who were responsible for
<div n="lb"/>the great development of the literary forms referred to
<div n="lb"/>above.
<div n="NI"/>Greek literature passed the Alexandrian, Roman and
<div n="lb"/>Byzantian periods before it arrived at the modern
<div n="lb"/>period. It was Solomos and Valoritus and others who
<div n="lb"/>gave impetus and inspiration to modern Greek litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture.
<div n="NI"/>GṚHADEVĪ. Another name of the demoness Jarā.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Jarā).
