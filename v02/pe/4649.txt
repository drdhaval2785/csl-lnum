NĀCIKETA¦ (NACIKETA). A sage of olden days. Son
<div n="lb"/>of Uddālaki, he lived for a long time in the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>serving his father, who devoted his time to performing
<div n="lb"/>yajñas. Naciketa, who was once sent into the forest for
<div n="lb"/>flowers etc. did not find them anywhere there, and he
<div n="lb"/>returned to the āśrama without them. Angry at this
<div n="lb"/>his father cursed him to be taken to Yamaloka.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly he went to Yamaloka. He waited at the
<div n="lb"/>gates for a long time to see Yama, who appeared at
<div n="lb"/>last when he sang the praises of Yama. The advice
<div n="lb"/>then given by Yama to Naciketa forms the Kaṭhopaniṣad.
<div n="lb"/>After studying the advice he returned to his father, who
<div n="lb"/>was pleased to find him a great scholar. (Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 71).
