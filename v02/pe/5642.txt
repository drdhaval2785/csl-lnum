RAKTABĪJA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Rebirth of Rambhāsura, father of Mahi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣāsura. Stories of Raktabīja and Rambhāsura are
<div n="lb"/>inextricably intertwined.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of Raktabīja.%} Once upon a time there lived an
<div n="lb"/>asura king called Danu. His two sons, Rambha and
<div n="lb"/>Karambha who had no children, did tapas at Pañcanada
<div n="lb"/>for the blessing of having issues. Rambha and Karambha
<div n="lb"/>meditated upon Mālavaṭa Yakṣa, the former seated at
<div n="lb"/>the centre of the five fires and the latter standing in the
<div n="lb"/>water. Indra in the guise of a crocodile dragged
<div n="lb"/>Karambha away by the feet and killed him. Angry at
<div n="lb"/>the death of his brother, Rambha decided to cut off his
<div n="lb"/>head and offer it in fire. When he was about to do so,
<div n="lb"/>Agni appeared and told him that suicide was worse
<div n="lb"/>than killing others, and promised to grant him what-
<div n="lb"/>ever he desired. Accordingly Rambha requested Agni
<div n="lb"/>for a son more effulgent than the latter, who would
<div n="lb"/>conquer the three worlds and would not be defeated
<div n="lb"/>even by the Devas and the Asuras. Rambha further
<div n="lb"/>wanted that son to be as powerful as Vāyu, exceptionally
<div n="lb"/>handsome and skilled in archery.
<div n="NI"/>Agni blessed Rambha that he would have, as desired, a
<div n="lb"/>son by the woman whom he coveted. On his way
<div n="lb"/>back home he saw a beautiful she-buffalo, which he
<div n="lb"/>married. He took the buffalo which got pregnant by
<div n="lb"/>him, to Pātāla to protect it from the attack by
<div n="lb"/>other buffaloes. One day another buffalo felt a passion
<div n="lb"/>for Rambha's wife and in the fight that ensued Rambha
<div n="lb"/>was killed by it. Rambha's wife died in his funeral
<div n="lb"/>pyre. It was from the centre of the fire that the very
<div n="lb"/>powerful Mahiṣāsura was born. Rambhāsura also rose
<div n="lb"/>from the fire under the name Raktabīja. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 17; Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Boon to Raktabīja.%} Raktabīja secured from Śiva a
<div n="lb"/>boon according to which if one drop of blood from
<div n="lb"/>his body fell on the battlefield, many Raktabījas would
<div n="lb"/>arise from the blood and fight the enemies. Each of
<div n="lb"/>these Raktabījas would also be like the others in the
<div n="lb"/>matter of strength, form and weapons. (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, 5th Skandha).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%His death.%} War between Devas and Asuras broke out
<div n="lb"/>and in the fight between Devī and Raktabīja blood from
<div n="lb"/>his body flowed. When Devī found it impossible to
<div n="lb"/>kill the lakhs of Raktāsuras who arose from the blood,
<div n="lb"/>she resorted to a trick. She asked Cāmuṇḍī to lick off
<div n="lb"/>the blood flowing from Raktabīja before it fell on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. Accordingly Devī began killing the asuras and
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī consuming their blood and flesh. When the
<div n="lb"/>artificial Raktabījas were all killed thus, the original
<div n="lb"/>Raktabīja alone remained and in the fight between
<div n="lb"/>them, Devī cut off his head with her sword. Cāmuṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>did not permit even a drop of blood to fall on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha).
