RĀMEŚVARA¦. There is in South India a very famous
<div n="lb"/>holy place called Rāmeśvara and a Śiva temple there.
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and others encamped on the sea shore to cross
<div n="lb"/>over to Laṅkā to release Sītā from Rāvaṇa's custody.
<div n="lb"/>This temple, according to Kamba, was built by Rāma at
<div n="lb"/>that time. The following story is from the Yuddha Kāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>To make the passage over to Laṅkā easy, Rāma decided to
<div n="lb"/>build a great temple at Rāmeśvara and install a Śivaliṅga
<div n="lb"/>in the temple. Under the expert supervision of the great
<div n="lb"/>architects, Nala and Nīla, all the monkeys cooperated to
<div n="lb"/>build the temple. As ordered by Rāma, Hanūmān went to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa to fetch Śivaliṅga. Hanūmān did not return
<div n="lb"/>with the liṅga though the auspicious time for the ins-
<div n="lb"/>tallation was very near. How could the installation be
[Page642-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>made without the idol and the installation had to be
<div n="lb"/>made at the appointed time.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma stood ready near the installation platform.
<div n="lb"/>It was the exact time for the installation of the idol.
<div n="lb"/>A divine effulgence was seen to emerge from Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>immediately a Śivaliṅga automatically appeared at the
<div n="lb"/>spot where rituals were conducted for installation.
<div n="lb"/>Everyone was wonder-struck by this mysterious hap-
<div n="lb"/>pening.
<div n="NI"/>Hanūmān by now, returned with the liṅga and he felt
<div n="lb"/>sorry that the installation of the idol had already been
<div n="lb"/>made. Śrī Rāma told him: “Please remove the idol
<div n="lb"/>already installed, we shall install a new one.”
<div n="NI"/>Happy at the words of Rāma, Hanūmān entwined the
<div n="lb"/>idol with his tail and jumped directly upwards. But,
<div n="lb"/>his tail was cut, head clashed against the roof which
<div n="lb"/>was broken and Hanūmān fell down unconscious. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma held him up and patted him on the head and
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān was more pleased than ever. Afterwards, to
<div n="lb"/>fulfil Hanūmān's desire and for the prosperity of the
<div n="lb"/>temple Hanūmān was made to install the new
<div n="lb"/>Śivaliṅga in front of the eastern tower of the temple.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma laid down the following rule also. Only after
<div n="lb"/>worshipping the idol at the tower, should the God in-
<div n="lb"/>side the temple be worshipped.
<div n="NI"/>The rule was also recorded there.
