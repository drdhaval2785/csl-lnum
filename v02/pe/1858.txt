DEVAŚARMĀ IV¦. The hero of a story told by Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>śarman.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇuśarman, the intelligent preceptor, told five stories
<div n="lb"/>based on five tactics to educate the five dull sons of
<div n="lb"/>emperor Sudarśana. The fifth tactics is called asaṃprek-
<div n="lb"/>ṣyakāritva. He told two important stories to illustrate
<div n="lb"/>the dangers, which would happen to those who act in
<div n="lb"/>haste and in anger, without patiently attempting to
<div n="lb"/>find out the truth. Devaśarman is the hero of one of
<div n="lb"/>the stories.
<div n="NI"/>{%Story one.%} Once upon a time there lived in Gauḍadeśa
[Page213-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin called Devaśarman with his wife Yajñasenā.
<div n="lb"/>When his wife got pregnant Devaśarman told her that a
<div n="lb"/>good and lucky son would be born to them to which she
<div n="lb"/>replied as follows:—“On no account build castles in
<div n="lb"/>the air and brood over things. I shall tell you a story
<div n="lb"/>about a danger which happened to one who built
<div n="lb"/>castles in the air. A brahmacārī was carrying home in
<div n="lb"/>a pot on his head some rice flour. On the way he
<div n="lb"/>thought thus: “I will purchase a she-goat with the
<div n="lb"/>money I get out of the sale of this rice powder, and
<div n="lb"/>it will deliver two kids every year. I will sell all the
<div n="lb"/>kids and with the sale proceeds purchase a cow and
<div n="lb"/>when it multiplies I will have the wherewithals for cul-
<div n="lb"/>tivation and then I will do cultivation in a good field
<div n="lb"/>and produce much paddy. And when I have thus money
<div n="lb"/>in hand I will renovate my house and marry. We will
<div n="lb"/>then have a good son whom I will name Somaśarman,
<div n="lb"/>and if my wife, without caring for the boy, goes to milk
<div n="lb"/>the cow I will go to the cow shed and give her a good
<div n="lb"/>beating. “When his imagination reached this point the
<div n="lb"/>pot on his head received, without his knowing, a blow
<div n="lb"/>with the stick in his hand and it fell down on the ground
<div n="lb"/>and was broken to pieces.”
<div n="NI"/>Five or six days after telling the above story to her
<div n="lb"/>husband Yajñasenā gave birth to a child. One day she
<div n="lb"/>went to the river to take her bath leaving the child
<div n="lb"/>to the care of her husband. Soon after a messenger came
<div n="lb"/>from the palace to invite Devaśarman for food, the day
<div n="lb"/>being Amāvasī when Brahmins were fed well and also
<div n="lb"/>given dakṣiṇā, (presents of money). He could not wait
<div n="lb"/>till his wife arrived; the child became a problem to
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="NI"/>The brahmin had a beloved Mongoose. After entrusting
<div n="lb"/>the child to the care of it the Brahmin went to the
<div n="lb"/>palace. Within a short time a serpent was seen crawling
<div n="lb"/>towards the child and the Mongoose attacked it and
<div n="lb"/>bit it into pieces. Naturally the Mongoose got itself
<div n="lb"/>smeared all over with the blood of the serpent, and the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin on returning home finding the Mongoose bath-
<div n="lb"/>ed in blood thought it might have eaten the child
<div n="lb"/>and in a rage he killed the poor Mongoose. But, when
<div n="lb"/>he entered the room and found pieces of the killed ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent strayed all over there truth and light dawned on
<div n="lb"/>him. Yajñasenā, who had returned after bath by now
<div n="lb"/>also found fault with him.
<div n="NI"/>{%The second story.%} Once there was a Brahmin in very indi-
<div n="lb"/>gent circumstances. He was an orphan from his very
<div n="lb"/>childhood. One day while he was asleep quite weary
<div n="lb"/>and tired as he had no food that day some one
<div n="lb"/>appeared and told him in a dream that three sannyāsins
<div n="lb"/>would come to his house that noon and that if beaten to
<div n="lb"/>death they would turn into three pot-fulls of treasure
<div n="lb"/>with which he could live comfortably well.
<div n="NI"/>His dream came true, and he locked up the treasure in
<div n="lb"/>his room after sending away a barber who had witnessed
<div n="lb"/>the incident with a piece of gold. The barber returned
<div n="lb"/>home cherishing in his mind the false belief that sann-
<div n="lb"/>yāsins beaten to death would turn into pot-fulls of
<div n="lb"/>treasure. And, one day some sannyāsins came to his
<div n="lb"/>house and he began beating them and they ran out
<div n="lb"/>crying aloud. Their cries attracted the attention of the
<div n="lb"/>servants of the King. The barber's limbs were cut off
<div n="lb"/>and he was killed on Śūla (a three-pronged weapon).
