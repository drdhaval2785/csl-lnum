VAJRA II¦. The son of Aniruddha, who was the
<div n="lb"/>grandson of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Mention is made in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 72, that
<div n="lb"/>after the extermination of the Yādavas by the mausala
<div n="lb"/>fight (the fight with grass grown from the filings of the
<div n="lb"/>iron-pestle), Arjuna anointed Vajra as the King of the
<div n="lb"/>remaining Yādavas. When the Pāṇḍavas began the
<div n="lb"/>Mahāprasthāna (the great departure), Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>called Subhadrā and instructed her to look after Vajra
<div n="lb"/>with particular care. (M.B. Mahā Prasthāna Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1, Stanza 8).
