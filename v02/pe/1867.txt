DEVASMITĀ¦. A Gem of a woman who was much devoted
<div n="lb"/>to her husband. The story of Devasmitā has been so
<div n="lb"/>often quoted in ancient Indian literature. She was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of a Vaiśya called Dharmagupta and was
<div n="lb"/>married to Guhasena, son of a Vaiśya called Dhana-
<div n="lb"/>datta, who belonged to Tāmraliptinagara.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of his father Guhasena decided to go to
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭāhadvīpa for trade, and Devasmitā, a very suspici-
<div n="lb"/>ous wife, objected to it. When his other relations began
<div n="lb"/>pressing him to go to the dvīpa for trade and his wife
<div n="lb"/>not to go, Guhasena could not take a decision on the
[Page214-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>matter. He began a penance so that God might take
<div n="lb"/>the decision in the matter. Devasmitā also followed
<div n="lb"/>him. Then God appeared to them in their dreams
<div n="lb"/>and gave each of them a red lotus flower saying, “both
<div n="lb"/>of you keep one flower each with you, and while both
<div n="lb"/>of you are away from each other if either of you go
<div n="lb"/>astray the lotus flower in the hands of the other
<div n="lb"/>person will fade.” And, on awaking both of them had
<div n="lb"/>a flower in their hands. Guhasena with his flower in
<div n="lb"/>his hands started for Kaṭāhadvīpa, and Devasmitā sta-
<div n="lb"/>yed at home with her eyes fixed on her lotus flower.
<div n="lb"/>Guhasena reached the dvīpa and traded in gems. Every-
<div n="lb"/>body was surprised to find in his hands a lotus flower
<div n="lb"/>which never faded. Four Vaiśya youngsters wanted to
<div n="lb"/>understand the secret of it and one day they invited
<div n="lb"/>Guhasena to their house and treated him to liquor very
<div n="lb"/>liberally. When he got absolutely drunk they question-
<div n="lb"/>ed him about the secret of the lotus flower, and he,
<div n="lb"/>though in indistinct words, explained it to them. When
<div n="lb"/>the secret was thus out all the four youngsters decided
<div n="lb"/>to seduce his wife. They extracted from him the infor-
<div n="lb"/>mation that he was not returning in the near future,
<div n="lb"/>and they then came to Tāmralipti.
<div n="NI"/>At that time there lived in Tāmralipti a bogus Sannyā-
<div n="lb"/>sinī (a female anchorite) called Yogakaraṇḍikā. The four
<div n="lb"/>youths from Kaṭāhadvīpa visited her, and she under-
<div n="lb"/>took to fulfil their desire. She asked them to halt at her
<div n="lb"/>house and then went to Devasmitā with some refreshments.
<div n="lb"/>Devasmitā's bitch barked very violently at the bogus an-
<div n="lb"/>chorite when she told the former thus:—“Child! don't
<div n="lb"/>you see the bitch barking at my very sight. The bitch is
<div n="lb"/>crying thinking of her previous birth at my sight. Her-
<div n="lb"/>self (the bitch) and I were, in our last birth, the wives
<div n="lb"/>of a Brahmin. Since our husband was a courtier at the
<div n="lb"/>palace often he was away from home and in his absence
<div n="lb"/>I used to satisfy the cravings of sex by associating freely
<div n="lb"/>with other males. I had even at that time realised the
<div n="lb"/>truth that there was no duty higher than satisfying the
<div n="lb"/>senses, and so I am now reborn with memories of the
<div n="lb"/>past life. As for this bitch in her past life as co-wife with
<div n="lb"/>me of the Brahmin, she sinned against her sense-organs
<div n="lb"/>by upholding, in ignorance, her chastity, as a punish-
<div n="lb"/>ment for which she was born as dog in this life. Yet, she
<div n="lb"/>remembers her past.
<div n="NI"/>Though Devasmitā saw through the false and trea-
<div n="lb"/>cherous heart of the bogus anchorite, without expres-
<div n="lb"/>sing it she talked in all respect with her. Believing that
<div n="lb"/>she had succeeded in her mission she told Devasmitā
<div n="lb"/>about the four youths who had come from Kaṭāha-
<div n="lb"/>dvīpa, and Devasmitā welcomed the idea very gladly.
<div n="NI"/>Devasmitā got some liquor and mixed poison in it.
<div n="lb"/>When it was night one of the Vaiśya youths came, and
<div n="lb"/>after rendering him unconscious by administering the
<div n="lb"/>poisoned liquor to him Devasmitā stripped him of all
<div n="lb"/>his clothes and ornaments, got him scratched on the
<div n="lb"/>brows by the bitch and threw him into a cow dung
<div n="lb"/>heap. Before it was dawn next day he returned to the
<div n="lb"/>anchorite's house, took a bath and dressed himself up in
<div n="lb"/>decent clothings. His other three companions also visi-
<div n="lb"/>ted Devasmitā one after the other in the next three
<div n="lb"/>days, and they too underwent the same experience as the
<div n="lb"/>first one. Lastly the bogus sannyāsinī also was got down
<div n="lb"/>and Devasmitā cut her limbs and sent her away. And,
<div n="lb"/>after this Devasmitā put on the garb of a merchant and
<div n="lb"/>went to Kaṭāhadvīpa and identified her husband from
[Page214-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>among a thousand merchants. Guhasena too felt his
<div n="lb"/>own doubts about her identity. But, without revealing
<div n="lb"/>her identity she saw the king and told him that she had
<div n="lb"/>certain matters to submit before the prajāpariṣat (popu-
<div n="lb"/>lar assembly). The King accordingly convened a session
<div n="lb"/>of the assembly and Devasmitā identified the four youths
<div n="lb"/>who had tried to seduce her and submitted all details
<div n="lb"/>regarding the episode. The King then gave her a lot of
<div n="lb"/>money, appointed the four youths as her servants and
<div n="lb"/>sent her back home with Guhasena. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāmukhalaṃbakam, Taraṅga 5).
