ŚAKTIBHADRA¦. A dramatist in Sanskrit, who lived
<div n="lb"/>in the seventh century A.D. He belonged to Cheng-
<div n="lb"/>annur in the Kerala State. He was a disciple of
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkarācārya. The Dramatic composition ‘Āścarya-
<div n="lb"/>cūḍāmaṇi’ is his work.
<div n="NI"/>Śaktibhadra, after writing his drama, once read it out
<div n="lb"/>to Śaṅkarācārya. As the ācārya was observing silence
<div n="lb"/>that day, he made no comments about the drama.
<div n="lb"/>Disappointed at this silence of his Guru, the drama-
<div n="lb"/>tist burnt his work to ashes in fire. When his observ-
<div n="lb"/>ance of silence was over, the Guru asked his disciple
<div n="lb"/>for the drama. When told about the burning of the
<div n="lb"/>drama the ācārya repeated from memory the whole
<div n="lb"/>drama. The above legend is widely prevalent in
<div n="lb"/>Kerala.
