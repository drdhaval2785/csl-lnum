ŚABARIMALA¦ (ŚABARI MOUNTAIN). A sacred
<div n="lb"/>place in South India in the eastern region of Kerala on
<div n="lb"/>a mountain called Śabarimala. It is not quite certain
<div n="lb"/>whether the name of this mountain is in any way related
<div n="lb"/>to Śabarī, to whom Śrī Rāma had given salvation. At
<div n="lb"/>any rate a very ancient temple with Śāstā as the presid-
<div n="lb"/>ing deity therein is found at Śabarimala today. It is
<div n="lb"/>proof positive of the great sanctity attached to the anci-
<div n="lb"/>ent temple that every year lakhs of devotees from all
<div n="lb"/>parts of India visit it braving dense forests, mountains
<div n="lb"/>and wild beasts on their way. Historical evidence
<div n="lb"/>about the origin of the temple or its philosophical
<div n="lb"/>importance is sparse, but there is a legend, more illu-
<div n="lb"/>minating than facts of history, about Śāstā (Ayyappan)
<div n="lb"/>the deity installed in the temple. The legend is as
<div n="lb"/>follows—
<div n="NI"/>In olden days the royal family of the Pāṇḍyas divided
<div n="lb"/>itself into two branches, one of them settling down at
<div n="lb"/>Velliyūr and the other at Madura. When the king of
<div n="lb"/>Madura one day went ahunting in the forest he met
<div n="lb"/>a handsome and very powerful and courageous Malayāli
<div n="lb"/>youth. The king immediately took a liking for him and
<div n="lb"/>appointed him as an officer in his army. The youth
<div n="lb"/>gradually rose up in military service to become the
<div n="lb"/>Commander-in-Chief. The other officers, who were
<div n="lb"/>jealous due to the rise of the youth—Ayyappan—began
<div n="lb"/>conspiring to drive him out. The queen became a
<div n="lb"/>weapon in the hands of the conspirators, and at their
<div n="lb"/>instance she pretended herself to be very ill and lay in
<div n="lb"/>a fainting fit. All the physicians acknowledged defeat
<div n="lb"/>in curing her. Then a physician, an agent of the conspira-
<div n="lb"/>tors, came forward and assured the king that he would
<div n="lb"/>cure the queen of her illness within one and a half hours
<div n="lb"/>if a leopard's milk was made available. The king told
<div n="lb"/>Ayyappan about it.
<div n="NI"/>Ayyappan went into the forest and returned to the
<div n="lb"/>palace with many she-leopards. He rode a tiger lead-
<div n="lb"/>ing the leopards. People in the royal court were fright-
<div n="lb"/>ened by the sight of the leopards. The King realised
<div n="lb"/>that Ayyappan was not an ordinary person. Being
<div n="lb"/>questioned about him by the King, Ayyappan replied
<div n="lb"/>that God was his father and the whole world his home.
<div n="lb"/>As he did not like to live any further with tale-bearers
<div n="lb"/>and conspirators he returned to Kerala.

<div n="lb"/>Ayyappan's departure made the King sad and very
<div n="lb"/>restless in mind. After giving all his immovable pro-
<div n="lb"/>perty on rent the King followed Ayyappan to Kerala
<div n="lb"/>taking all his ornaments, jars and other utensils, and
<div n="lb"/>came at last to Pantalam. This region of Kerala was
<div n="lb"/>then in the control of a petty Chieftain called Kaip-
<div n="lb"/>puzha Tampān. The King of Madura purchased some
<div n="lb"/>land from the Tampān, put up a palace there and lived
<div n="lb"/>therein with the members of his family.
<div n="NI"/>Ayyappasvāmī on his way back to Kerala met Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma, who told the former that he had already, for the
<div n="lb"/>protection of Kerala, installed on mountains and the
<div n="lb"/>sea-coast idols of his (Ayyappasvāmī) and that he would
<div n="lb"/>install another idol of Ayyappan at Śabarimala where
<div n="lb"/>they had now met each other. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Ayyappasvāmī took his abode there.
<div n="NI"/>One of those days the Pāṇḍyan king living at Pan-
<div n="lb"/>talam had a dream, and in that dream Ayyappasvāmī
<div n="lb"/>appeared and told him that he (Ayyappan) was living
<div n="lb"/>at Śabarimala and the King might meet the Svāmī if
<div n="lb"/>he went there. The next day morning the King with
<div n="lb"/>his retinue started for Śabarimala. At Śabarimala the
<div n="lb"/>King got the forest cleared and made a search of the
<div n="lb"/>ground where he found an idol installed by Paraśurāma.
<div n="lb"/>The King built a temple there and installed the idol of
<div n="lb"/>Ayyappasvāmī therein. He also got necessary purifica-
<div n="lb"/>tory ceremonies conducted in the temple by the famous
<div n="lb"/>tantrī (high-priest) Tāzhamaṇ. A routine programme
<div n="lb"/>for the conduct of affairs in the temple was fixed. As
<div n="lb"/>it was difficult for men to live in the forest infested by
<div n="lb"/>wild beasts and conduct pūjā etc. daily, it was fixed that
<div n="lb"/>pūjās need be conducted only for five days in every
<div n="lb"/>month and that Makarasaṃkrānti should be the annual
<div n="lb"/>festival day. From the first of Makaraṃ (January) for
<div n="lb"/>five days it was to be utsava with the deity led in pro-
<div n="lb"/>cession. On the fifth of Makaram every year a
<div n="lb"/>‘Kalabham’ and on the seventh day a ‘guruti’ also were
<div n="lb"/>ordained.
<div n="NI"/>On the annual festival day the temple priest, the senior
<div n="lb"/>pilgrim, mārārs and other employees go to Śabarimala
<div n="lb"/>carrying with them rice etc. for food and calling
<div n="lb"/>aloud ‘Svāmiye Śaraṇam Ayyappa’ (Oh! lord Ayyappa!
<div n="lb"/>you are our refuge), devotees climb the mountain to-
<div n="lb"/>day also repeating this slogan. (See under Śāstā).
