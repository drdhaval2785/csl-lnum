MENĀ I¦. Wife of Himavān. Beautiful Menā was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Mahāmeru.
<div n="NI"/>Himavān lord of the mountains and the seat of many
<div n="lb"/>minerals and fossils had two daughters of unparallelled
<div n="lb"/>beauty and their mother was the lovely Menā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāmeru and wife of Himavān. (Sarga 35, Bāla
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Rāmāyaṇa states that Menā had two daughters of
<div n="lb"/>extraordinary beauty named Gaṅgā and Umā. They
<div n="lb"/>were both married by Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>But Vāmana Purāṇa in chapter 51 states that Menā
<div n="lb"/>had three beautiful daughters and a son named
<div n="lb"/>Sunābha. Menā's first daughter was Rāgiṇī with
<div n="lb"/>red body and eyes and wearing a red dress. Her
<div n="lb"/>second daughter named Kuṭilā was white in colour,
<div n="lb"/>had lotus eyes, and wore white dress. The third was
<div n="lb"/>a girl of enchanting beauty named Kālī. She was
<div n="lb"/>blue-black in colour with eyes like the blue lotus leaf.
<div n="NI"/>It can be surmised that the Umā of Rāmāyaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Kālī were one and the same person by the following
<div n="lb"/>verse in the Amarakośa.
<Poem>Umā Kātyāyanī Gaurī
<div n="lb"/>Kālī Haimavatīśvarī //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>When the statements of the two Purāṇas are taken
<div n="lb"/>together Menā should have had four daughters,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā, Rāgiṇī, Kuṭilā and Kālī and a son named
<div n="lb"/>Sunābha.
