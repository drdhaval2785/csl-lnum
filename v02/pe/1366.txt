BUDDHISMÂ¦. (BUDDHA-MATA). The origin of Bud-
<div n="lb"/>dhism was in the sixth century B.C. This new religion
<div n="lb"/>was shaped out of Hinduism that prevailed at that
<div n="lb"/>time. Buddhism which had its origin in North India,
<div n="lb"/>prevailed everywhere in India up to the eleventh
[Page166-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. During that period there was an over-
<div n="lb"/>flow of this religion to the other parts of Asia. Now
<div n="lb"/>this religion has its full sway over the people of Burma.
<div n="lb"/>90% of the population there, are adherents of Bud-
<div n="lb"/>dhism. 80% of the people of Thailand, 60% of the
<div n="lb"/>people in Ceylon and Japan and 17% in China are
<div n="lb"/>now Buddhists. In India, Pakistan and the Philippines
<div n="lb"/>the Buddhists are only a minority. Even though Indo-
<div n="lb"/>nesia is a Muslim country there is a small class of
<div n="lb"/>Buddhists there. Combodia, Lavos and Tibet are consi-
<div n="lb"/>dered to be Buddhist countries. In Nepal there are
<div n="lb"/>only two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. In count-
<div n="lb"/>ries outside Asia there are followers of Buddhism.
<div n="lb"/>Statistics reveal that there are one hundred and sixty-
<div n="lb"/>five thousand Buddhists in North America, one
<div n="lb"/>hundred and thirtyfive thousand in South America,
<div n="lb"/>and ten thousand in Europe. The number of Buddhists
<div n="lb"/>in the world today is 150.31 crores.
