JAYA¦ XI. (JAYAVIJAYAS). They were gate-keepers of
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. As these two sons of devas were engaged
<div n="lb"/>in the service of Mahāviṣṇu guarding the gate, the
<div n="lb"/>hermits Sanaka and others came to see Mahāviṣṇu to
<div n="lb"/>pay him homage. Jaya and Vijaya stopped them at the
<div n="lb"/>gate. Sanaka got angry and cursed them to take three
<div n="lb"/>births on the earth as Asuras (demons). The sorrow-
<div n="lb"/>ful Jaya and Vijaya requested for absolution from the
<div n="lb"/>curse. The hermit said that they had to take three
<div n="lb"/>births as Asuras and that they would be redeemed by the
<div n="lb"/>weapon of Mahāviṣṇu. Accordingly Jaya and Vijaya
<div n="lb"/>were born in the earth as Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyaka-
<div n="lb"/>śipu. They were killed by Mahāviṣṇu. In the second
<div n="lb"/>birth they were Rāvaṇa and Kuṃbhakarṇa. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu incarnated as Śrī Rāma killed them. In the third
<div n="lb"/>birth they were Śiśupāla and Dantavaktra. They were
<div n="lb"/>killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, an incarnation of Bhagavān Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>For further details see under Hiraṇyākṣa. Hiraṇyaka-
<div n="lb"/>śipu, Rāvaṇa; Kuṃbhakarṇa, Śiśupāla and Dantavak-
<div n="lb"/>tra. After three births Jaya and Vijaya returned to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
