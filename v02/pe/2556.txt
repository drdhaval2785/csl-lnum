HĀLĀHALA¦(S) A sect of asuras, who were the first
<div n="lb"/>creation of the Trimūrtis, when they also possessed the
<div n="lb"/>power of creation. The Hālāhalas, who became very
<div n="lb"/>powerful within a short period of time earned from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā all the boons they wanted, and they then
<div n="lb"/>conquered the three worlds. At last they barricaded
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa and Vaikuṇṭha also, and Hariharas (Viṣṇu and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva) defeated them after a fierce fight lasting for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. The Hariharas returned to their abodes
<div n="lb"/>and spoke about their achievements. Their wives laugh-
<div n="lb"/>ed at the bravado of their husbands. At this Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu got angry with Lakṣmī and Śiva with Pārvatī,
<div n="lb"/>and in protest the Devīs left their husbands. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards Viṣṇu and Śiva began losing their
<div n="lb"/>power. Brahmā, who divined the reason for the growing
<div n="lb"/>weakness of Viṣṇu and Śiva persuaded Lakṣmī and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī to return to their husbands so that they might
<div n="lb"/>regain their former power. Yet, Brahmā told them that
<div n="lb"/>in future he alone would handle the work of creation.
<div n="lb"/>Thus was Viṣṇu and Śiva divested of their right to
<div n="lb"/>creation. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
