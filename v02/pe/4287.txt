MĀṆḌAKARṆI¦ (ŚĀTAKARṆI). A sage. Once this
<div n="lb"/>sage spent ten thousand years in a pond performing
<div n="lb"/>penance. Devas were bewildered and they sent five
<div n="lb"/>beautiful celestial maidens to divert the attention of
<div n="lb"/>the sage from his severe austerities. They enticed him
<div n="lb"/>and the sage constructed a grand and palatial house
<div n="lb"/>for them and stayed there with them. There was
<div n="lb"/>always music and dance there. The pond was there-
<div n="lb"/>after known as ‘Pañcāpsaras’. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>during their exile in the forests with Sītā visited this
<div n="lb"/>place. (Sarga 11, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
