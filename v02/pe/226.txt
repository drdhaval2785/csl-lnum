AṂŚUMATĪ¦. The daughter of the Gandharva King
<div n="lb"/>named Dramila. Her story is narrated in the Śiva
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa to illustrate the benefits of performing the Pra-
<div n="lb"/>doṣa-Vrata. Sūta expatiates on the importance and
<div n="lb"/>advantages of Pradoṣa-Vrata to a number of sages
<div n="lb"/>in Naiṃiśāraṇya. King Satyaratha was a scrupulous
<div n="lb"/>observer of Pradoṣa-Vrata. Unfortunately he defaulted
<div n="lb"/>in his observance of the Vrata owing to unavoidable
<div n="lb"/>circumstances and, after his death, was born again as
<div n="lb"/>the King of Vidarbha. He was killed in a battle by the
<div n="lb"/>King of Sālva and his wife, pregnant at that time, fled
<div n="lb"/>to a forest. She gave birth to a son on the bank of a
<div n="lb"/>river. Then, when she stepped into the river to drink
<div n="lb"/>some water, she was carried away by a crocodile. Pre-
<div n="lb"/>sently a Brahmin woman named Uṣā happened to pass
<div n="lb"/>that way with her son named Śucivrata. Seeing a new-
<div n="lb"/>born infant there, that Brahmin woman took him, gave
<div n="lb"/>him the name, Dharmagupta and brought him up as
<div n="lb"/>her own son. According to the advice of a pious Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min named Śāṇḍilya, both Śucivrata and Dharmagupta
[Page034-a+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>started performing Pradoṣa-Vrata. Lord Śiva was pleas-
<div n="lb"/>ed with them and gave them much wealth. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>gupta happened to meet Aṃśumatī, daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva King, Dramila, one day in a forest and
<div n="lb"/>they fell in love with each other. Dramila came to
<div n="lb"/>know of their love and so gave his daughter in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to Dharmagupta. As a result of the wealth and power
<div n="lb"/>which he had acquired by observing strictly Pradoṣa-
<div n="lb"/>Vrata Dharmagupta was able to return to Vidarbha,
<div n="lb"/>defeat King Sālva and regain his kingdom from him.
