ṚTADHVAJA I¦. (KUVALĀŚVA—DHUNDHUMĀRA).
<div n="lb"/>A famous King of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the
<div n="lb"/>following order—Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān
<div n="lb"/>-Vaivasvata Manu—Ikṣvāku—Vikukṣi—Śaśāda—
<div n="lb"/>Kākutstha—Anenas—Pṛthulāśva—Viṣvagaśva—Adri—
<div n="lb"/>Kuvalāsva (Dhundhumāra).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got the name Dhundhumāra.%} The most
<div n="lb"/>heroic exploit of Kuvalāśva or Kuvalayāśva was his
<div n="lb"/>killing of the Asura Dhundhu.
<div n="NI"/>Madhu and Kaiṭabha were two Asuras born from the
<div n="lb"/>ears of Mahāviṣṇu. The Asura Dhundhu was their
<div n="lb"/>son. After his birth, Mahāviṣṇu killed Madhu and
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha. Dhundhu was furious over the death of his
<div n="lb"/>fathers. He worshipped Brahmā who granted him
<div n="lb"/>unconquerable strength. After defeating the gods he
<div n="lb"/>went to the desert called Ujjālaka and lay beneath the
<div n="lb"/>sands. Whenever he heaved a sigh clouds of dust rose
<div n="lb"/>up to the sky and the earth shook for seven days. It
<div n="lb"/>caused great damage to life and property in the world,
<div n="lb"/>like a storm. Uttaṅka, a sage who lived in the
<div n="lb"/>neighbourhood of Ujjālaka was the person who
<div n="lb"/>suffered most from Dhundhu's misdeeds.
<div n="NI"/>Bṛhadaśva, of Ikṣvāku dynasty and father of Kuvalāśva
<div n="lb"/>in his old age entrusted the rule of the country to his
<div n="lb"/>son and prepared to go to the forest. At that time,
<div n="lb"/>sage Uttaṅka came there and advised the King to go
<div n="lb"/>to the forest only after killing Dhundhu. Bṛhadaśva
<div n="lb"/>called his son Kuvalāśva and after giving him the task
<div n="lb"/>of killing Dhundhu, proceeded to the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Kuvalāśva had 21,000 sons. Leading them, he went to
<div n="lb"/>the desert Ujjālaka to kill Dhundhu. Uttaṅka declared
<div n="lb"/>that anyone who killed Dhundhu would get part of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu's strength. Kuvalāśva's sons surrounded
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu. The Asura awoke with anger. In the fire
<div n="lb"/>from his eyes, all the 21,000 sons of Kuvalāśva were
<div n="lb"/>burnt to ashes. Next Kuvalāśva came into conflict with
<div n="lb"/>Dhundḥu. In that fight Dhundhu was killed. The gods
<div n="lb"/>gave Kuvalāśva many boons. From that day, Kuvalā va
<div n="lb"/>got the name, “Dhundhumāra” (one who killed
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu). (M.B. Vana Parva, 4 Chapters from 201).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%His sons.%} Kuvalāśva had three more sons named
<div n="lb"/>Dṛḍhāśva, Kapilāśva and Candrāśva, or Bhadrāśva
<div n="lb"/>besides the 21,000 sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>204, Verse 40).
<div n="NI"/>4) Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 59 gives the following
<div n="lb"/>account of how Kuvalāśva won the favour of sage
<div n="lb"/>Gālava.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago while sage Gālava was performing tapas in
<div n="lb"/>his āśrama, an Asura called Pātālaketu used to disturb
<div n="lb"/>his meditations regularly. One day, the sage looked up
<div n="lb"/>to Heaven and heaved a sigh. At once a horse dropped
<div n="lb"/>down from the sky. A mysterious voice was heard
<div n="lb"/>saying—“This mighty horse will travel thousands of
[Page653-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>yojanas in a day.” The sage received that horse and
<div n="lb"/>presented it to Ṛtadhvaja, King of the lunar dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja mounted the horse and killed Pātālaketu.
<div n="NI"/>It was Viśvāvasu who dropped this horse from Heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Pātālaketu had once fallen in love with Viśvāvasu's
<div n="lb"/>daughter, Madālasā. It was in revenge that Viśvāvasu
<div n="lb"/>had done like this.
