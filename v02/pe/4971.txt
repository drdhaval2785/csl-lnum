PĀÑCĀLIKA¦ (PĀÑCĀLIKEŚA). A Yakṣa who was
<div n="lb"/>a son of Kubera. In some parts of Bhārata this Yakṣa
<div n="lb"/>is worshipped as a deity. It is believed that Śiva had
<div n="lb"/>given Pāñcālīka a boon that he who worships him
<div n="lb"/>whether he be man or woman, young or old, would
<div n="lb"/>become intoxicated with vigour. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>behind Pāñcālika obtaining this boon:—
<div n="NI"/>When Satī who was insulted at the Dakṣayāga was
<div n="lb"/>consumed by fire a bereaved Śiva sat inactive and
<div n="lb"/>moody at a lonely place. When this continued for a
<div n="lb"/>long time Kāmadeva (god of love) at the request of
<div n="lb"/>the other devas sent arrows against him and made him
<div n="lb"/>lustful. Śiva then started running passionately calling
<div n="lb"/>the name of his wife and finding her nowhere jumped
<div n="lb"/>into the river Kālindī to commit suicide. (The
<div n="lb"/>waters of Kālindī became black from that time on-
<div n="lb"/>wards). Kālindī was unable to bear the burden of
<div n="lb"/>the soul of Śiva and so he had to get out to the shore
<div n="lb"/>and run again. At this time Kāmadeva sent another
<div n="lb"/>arrow, unmādāstra (arrow of intoxication) also against
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Śiva could not bear the impact of the two
<div n="lb"/>arrows together and he laboured under great strain.
<div n="lb"/>Just then he saw Pāñcālika son of Kubera coming that
<div n="lb"/>way. Śiva then made him understand his difficulties
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to take charge of the force of the
<div n="lb"/>arrows from him. Pāñcālika did so and saved Śiva
<div n="lb"/>from his toil. Pleased at this Śiva blessed him. He
<div n="lb"/>said that Pāñcālika will be worshipped by people in
[Page552-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the month of Caitra and all those who do so will be
<div n="lb"/>invigorated. He added that henceforth he would be
<div n="lb"/>known as Pāñcālikeśa also.
