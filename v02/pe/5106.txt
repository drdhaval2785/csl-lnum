PAṬṬATTĀNA¦. This was a custom which was in force
<div n="lb"/>in the ancient temples of Kerala from the 9th century
<div n="lb"/>A.D. Paṭṭa means a ‘Sanskrit pandit’ ‘Paṭṭas’ is used
<div n="lb"/>as its plural. To give instructions in śāstras and upani-
<div n="lb"/>ṣads to the three upper classes and to read in public
<div n="lb"/>at fixed times the Purāṇas, to make people more and
<div n="lb"/>more religious minded, it was the custom to appoint
<div n="lb"/>Paṭṭas in temples in ancient Kerala. This position which
<div n="lb"/>was the loftiest that could be attained by a pandit of
<div n="lb"/>those times was called by the name Paṭṭattāna. From
<div n="lb"/>the 9th century A. D. references are found about
<div n="lb"/>Paṭṭattāna in official records. In all important temples
<div n="lb"/>a māvāratapaṭṭa used to be appointed. His duty was to
<div n="lb"/>read and explain Mahābhārata to people.
<div n="NI"/>Ūrālars who conducted the day to day administration
<div n="lb"/>of the temples and the Koiladhikāri who represented
<div n="lb"/>the supreme authority, and the King, jointly granted
<div n="lb"/>the Paṭṭattāna to deserving people. Pandits used to
<div n="lb"/>come to temples and engage themselves in religions
[Page584-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>polemics to make themselves worthy of the grant of
<div n="lb"/>Paṭṭattāna. The Paṭṭas were entitled to some profits
<div n="lb"/>from the temples. Records of the 3rd century Malayālam
<div n="lb"/>Era regarding the routine expenditure in the Tiruvalla
<div n="lb"/>temple mention about ‘five nāzhis of rice to be given to
<div n="lb"/>each of the Paṭṭas within the temple’. Paṭṭas also were
<div n="lb"/>given many lands free of tax as were given to Ūrālars.
<div n="lb"/>In the Manalikkara order of 1236 A.D. and the
<div n="lb"/>Padmanābhapura order of 1237 A.D. mention is made
<div n="lb"/>about these grants. Paṭṭasthāna and Ūrāymasthāna
<div n="lb"/>became hereditary after some time and began to
<div n="lb"/>decline in importance.
<div n="NI"/>Even the meaning of the word Paṭṭattāna underwent a
<div n="lb"/>change. In Cochin it meant the ceremony of giving
<div n="lb"/>feasts followed by money-bags to invited brahmins by
<div n="lb"/>the Kings to obtain puṇya for the dead members of the
<div n="lb"/>royal family. The zamorins of Calicut meant by
<div n="lb"/>Paṭṭattāna the act of giving fifty-one bags each con-
<div n="lb"/>taining fiftyone rupees to the successful candidates in
<div n="lb"/>śāstrārtha contests held at the Tali temple during the
<div n="lb"/>period between Revatī and Tiruvātira (Ardrā) in the
<div n="lb"/>month of Tulām. There is a difference of opinion
<div n="lb"/>regarding the number of money-bags and the amount
<div n="lb"/>in each. Ullūr S. Parameśvara Iyer in his Vijñāna-
<div n="lb"/>dīpikā (page 148) states that the number of bags were
<div n="lb"/>46 and the money in each was two hundred rupees. Of
<div n="lb"/>these, twelve bags each were sanctioned for Prābhākara
<div n="lb"/>Mīmāṃsā and Bhāṭṭamīmāṃsā, nine for Vyākaraṇa, and
<div n="lb"/>thirteen for Vedānta. According to certain records 48
<div n="lb"/>bags were given in the year 1679 A.D. Contests in
<div n="lb"/>Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā were held on the southern
<div n="lb"/>temple-tower gate of the Tali temple and in Vyākaraṇa
<div n="lb"/>on the southern platform of the northern temple tower
<div n="lb"/>gate of the same temple. The custom of giving hund-
<div n="lb"/>red and one rupees each to one hundred and eight
<div n="lb"/>scholars in Śrī Padmanābhasvāmī temple of Trivandrum
<div n="lb"/>is also called Paṭṭattāna.
