TĀRĀ I¦. Wife of Bāli, best of Vānaras (monkeys).
<div n="lb"/>There are two stories different from each other regard-
<div n="lb"/>ing the birth of Tārā. One version is that Tārā was
<div n="lb"/>born during the churning of the Milk-Ocean.
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata, Uccaiśśravas, Kalpavṛkṣa, Cintāmaṇi,
<div n="lb"/>Kaustubha, Candra, Apsarases, Mahālakṣmī Tārā
<div n="lb"/>and Rumā rose from the sea of Milk. (Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa). The second version is
<div n="lb"/>that Tārā was the daughter of Suṣeṇa. Bāli at the time
<div n="lb"/>of his death is said to have spoken thus of his wife Tārā
<div n="lb"/>“Tārā, daughter of Suṣeṇa, is well learned and is
<div n="lb"/>capable of assessing a situation and suggesting the
<div n="lb"/>correct thing to be done at that time. If she says a
<div n="lb"/>thing is good, it is never otherwise.” (Chapter 22,
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). From this it
<div n="lb"/>can be understood that Tārā was the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Suṣeṇa and we get an idea of the character of Tārā also
<div n="lb"/>from this. (See under Bāli).
