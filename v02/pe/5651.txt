RAMAṆA¦ (M). (RAMAṆAKAM). An island near
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā where, according to Chapter 38 of the Southern
<div n="lb"/>Text of Bhārata, there was a forest. It was in this island
<div n="lb"/>that Vinatā, mother of Garuḍa and Kadrū, mother of
<div n="lb"/>the nāgas lived. Garuḍa, after freeing his mother from
<div n="lb"/>her slavery evicted the nāgas from this island. (Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 17). Following the eviction,
<div n="lb"/>many of the prominent nāgas lived in Pātāla. But,
<div n="lb"/>Kāliya, in fear of Garuḍa, lived in Kālindī. After his
<div n="lb"/>suppression by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Kāliya, with his family, as
<div n="lb"/>advised by Kṛṣṇa returned to Ramaṇakam. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
