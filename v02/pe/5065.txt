PARṆĀŚĀ¦. A river of western Bhārata. This river sits
<div n="lb"/>in the court of Varuṇa in the form of a nymph. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>9, Chapter 1, Sabhā Parva). Śrutāyudha, a valiant
<div n="lb"/>soldier who fought against Arjuna in the great Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra battle was the son of Parṇāsā. Varuṇa was the
<div n="lb"/>father of Śrutāyudha and at the time of the birth of a
<div n="lb"/>son for her she requested Varuṇa to grant her a boon
<div n="lb"/>that her son would not be killed by anybody. Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>while granting her the boon gave the son a mace. That
[Page575-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>mace had a peculiarity. If the mace was used against
<div n="lb"/>anybody who was not fighting, the mace would turn
<div n="lb"/>back and kill the user. With the help of that mace
<div n="lb"/>Śrutāyudha gave Arjuna a fierce fight and in the
<div n="lb"/>midst of the heat he forgot the condition stipulated by
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa and used it against Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was standing
<div n="lb"/>nearby watching their fight. The mace turned back
<div n="lb"/>and killed Śrutāyudha. (Chapter 92, Droṇa Parva).
