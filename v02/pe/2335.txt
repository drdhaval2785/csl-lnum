GĀṆḌĪVA¦. The famous bow of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Make.%} It was Brahmā who made the bow. ‘This
<div n="lb"/>terrible bow which can punish the unjust and the
<div n="lb"/>wicked has been made by Brahmā’. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 98, Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Specialities of Gāṇḍīva.%} This bow is enough to fight
<div n="lb"/>one lakh of people at one and the same time. Both
<div n="lb"/>Devas and men could be defeated with it. Chiselled
<div n="lb"/>very smooth and shining with many colours it was a
<div n="lb"/>very long bow. It was worshipped by Devas, Dānavas
<div n="lb"/>and Gandharvas. (Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 43). It
<div n="lb"/>gained and also decreased in power as the situation
<div n="lb"/>called for. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 98, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%History of Gāṇḍīva.%} Brahmā, who made this bow
<div n="lb"/>kept it with him during the first 1000 years. For the
<div n="lb"/>next 1000 years Prajāpati kept it with him. Next, Indra
<div n="lb"/>got it from Prajāpati and he used it for 3585 years.
<div n="lb"/>After that Candra kept it for 500 years with him, and
<div n="lb"/>then Varuṇa came in possession of it. After using it for
<div n="lb"/>100 years Varuṇa gave it to Arjuna, who used it for 65
<div n="lb"/>years.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gāṇḍīva and Arjuna.%} Arjuna agreed to protect the
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍava forest from rain, if Indra sent rain when
<div n="lb"/>Agni began eating the forest. But, realising that Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>possessed no weapons to effectively oppose Indra, Agni
<div n="lb"/>requested Varuṇa to give the following to Arjuna, viz.,
<div n="lb"/>the Gāṇḍīva bow and a quiver wherein the arrows
<div n="lb"/>will never be exhausted, and the chariot marked with
<div n="lb"/>the symbol of monkey and drawn by four white horses
<div n="lb"/>-all kept by Candra. Varuṇa at once made a present
<div n="lb"/>of the above to Arjuna. And, it was with the aid of this
<div n="lb"/>Gāṇḍīva, that Arjuna defeated Indra at the time of
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍavadāha. (See Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna had
<div n="lb"/>taken a secret vow to cut off the head of anyone who
<div n="lb"/>asked him to give the bow to some one else. (Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 69).
<div n="NI"/>In after years Arjuna won many wars with the help of
<div n="lb"/>this bow. (See Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Arjuna gives up Gāṇḍīva.%} The great Kurukṣetra war,
<div n="lb"/>which shook Bhārata, to its very foundation came to an
<div n="lb"/>end. Dharmaputra was crowned a King. It was at this
<div n="lb"/>juncture that the Yādava dynasty got itself anni-
[Page276-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>hilated and Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered mahāsamādhi. Now the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas lost all interest in mundane life, and they
<div n="lb"/>set out for the forest on their great journey after crown-
<div n="lb"/>ing Parīkṣit, the grandson of Arjuna as King. Their
<div n="lb"/>great travel took them to the shores of the Red Sea.
<div n="lb"/>The Gāṇḍīva was still in Arjuna's hands. On the shores
<div n="lb"/>of the Red Sea Agni Deva appeared before the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas and spoke to them “Well, Pāṇḍavas, I am Agni
<div n="lb"/>Deva. Arjuna requires the Gāṇḍīva no more. I got it
<div n="lb"/>from Varuṇa for Arjuna. Return it, therefore, to
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa.”
<div n="NI"/>No sooner did he hear Agni Deva speak thus than did
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna throw it into the depths of the sea and also the
<div n="lb"/>quiver which never got exhausted of arrows with it.
<div n="lb"/>Agni Deva disappeared, and the Pāṇḍavas continued
<div n="lb"/>their journey. (Mahāprasthānika Parva, Chapter 1).
