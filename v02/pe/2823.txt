JĀJALI¦. A hermit who reared birds on his head by
<div n="lb"/>the power of penance.
<div n="NI"/>This hermit who had practised continence from his
<div n="lb"/>childhood lived in a forest. Jājali never thought rain,
<div n="lb"/>heat of the sun, snow and such other natural things
<div n="lb"/>as unbearable. Once this hermit stood like a pillar in
<div n="lb"/>the forest, immersed in meditation. Two birds built
<div n="lb"/>their nests in his matted hair. Non-violence being his
<div n="lb"/>policy, he did not move. The birds came to their nests
<div n="lb"/>every evening and stayed for the night. After a few
<div n="lb"/>days they laid eggs in the nests. Still the hermit did not
<div n="lb"/>move. The eggs were hatched. The hermit understood
<div n="lb"/>that also. Still, he did not move. The young ones got
<div n="lb"/>wings. They grew up and began to go out with the
<div n="lb"/>parent birds. They went out in the morning and
<div n="lb"/>returned in the evening. The hermit stood like
<div n="lb"/>a pillar. One morning they went out and
<div n="lb"/>did not return in the evening. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>stood there for six days waiting for the return
<div n="lb"/>of the birds. On the sixth day evening they
<div n="lb"/>returned. Next time the hermit waited for a month
<div n="lb"/>for the return of the birds. They did not return. So he
<div n="lb"/>started from there and went to the sea and dipped in
<div n="lb"/>the water and said, “there is no man more virtuous
<div n="lb"/>than I either in water or on land” with haughtiness. But
<div n="lb"/>the water demons said in an ethereal voice that Tulā-
<div n="lb"/>dhāra, the merchant of Kāśī was more virtuous than
<div n="lb"/>he.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Jājali went to Kāśī and saw Tulādhāra.
<div n="lb"/>Tulādhāra greeted him gladly and they talked for a
<div n="lb"/>long time. Jājali understood that Tulādhāra was far
<div n="lb"/>more virtuous than he. So he sought advice from
<div n="lb"/>Tulādhāra and thus Jājali obtained heaven. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, 3 Chapters from 261).
