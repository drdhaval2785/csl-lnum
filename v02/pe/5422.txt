PṚṢADHRA III¦. A brahmin boy. One night while he
<div n="lb"/>was living in the āśrama of his Guru he saw a lion going
<div n="lb"/>out from the premises of the āśrama with an āśrama
<div n="lb"/>cow in its mouth. The brahmin boy rushed at it and
<div n="lb"/>struck the lion with a sword. But due to want of proper
<div n="lb"/>light the sword-cut fell on the cow and the cow fell
<div n="lb"/>down dead. The next day the Guru finding the cow
<div n="lb"/>lying dead mistook it for a deliberate killing by his
<div n="lb"/>disciple and cursed Pṛṣadhra to death. to be born as
<div n="lb"/>a Śūdra. When Pṛṣadhra was thus roaming about in
<div n="lb"/>the forests in his cursed form he fell into a big forest
<div n="lb"/>fire and was burnt to death. (Chapter 2, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa; Chapter 1, Aṃśa 4, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
