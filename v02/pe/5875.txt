SADĀCĀRA¦ (Good conduct).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Each country has good custom-
<div n="lb"/>ary practices of its own. A man with good habits or
<div n="lb"/>behaviour is considered as having conquered the two
<div n="lb"/>worlds. The sound ‘Sat’ denotes ‘Sādhus.’ Sādhus are
<div n="lb"/>those who are without any bad conduct or behaviour.
<div n="lb"/>The habits and practices of the Sādhus are called
<div n="lb"/>Sadācāra. The Saptarṣis, (the seven hermits), the
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpatis (Lords of all creatures) and Manus (the
<div n="lb"/>fathers of men), were persons who were careful to keep
<div n="lb"/>up the good practices. Once the hermit Aurva advised
<div n="lb"/>Sagara, what the good usages of the people of Bhārata
<div n="lb"/>ought to be. The laws of good conduct according to
<div n="lb"/>hermit Aurva are given below:
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The passing of excrement and urine.%} Every one should
<div n="lb"/>wake up in the Brāhmamuhūrta (Two hours before
<div n="lb"/>dawn). After having risen, he should go to the south-
<div n="lb"/>west corner of the village or house at a distance of an
<div n="lb"/>arrow-shot for stooling and passing urine; should not
<div n="lb"/>pour the water used for washing the face and the legs,
<div n="lb"/>in the courtyard; should not pass urine in one's own
<div n="lb"/>shadow, or in the shade of a tree, or facing cow, the
<div n="lb"/>Sun, fire, wind, teacher and Brahmin. Ploughed fields,
<div n="lb"/>fields where grains are ready for harvest, cattleshed,
<div n="lb"/>crowd, path, lakes or rivers and their banks, are places,
<div n="lb"/>forbidden for stooling or passing urine. When there is
<div n="lb"/>no danger, a wise man should pass urine, facing the
<div n="lb"/>north in the day and facing south at night. When
<div n="lb"/>passing excrement the ground should be covered with
<div n="lb"/>grass and his head should be covered with cloth. Should
<div n="lb"/>not sit long or talk much when stooling.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The conduct of ablution after answering the calls of%}
<div n="lb"/>{%nature and rinsing the mouth after meals.%} Soil such as taken
<div n="lb"/>from white ant-hill, ground thrown up by moles or rats,
<div n="lb"/>soil at the bottom of water, remainder of soil used by
<div n="lb"/>another, soil taken from the wall, soil gathered by worms
<div n="lb"/>and flies, ploughed soil etc. should not be used for ablu-
<div n="lb"/>tion. By using soil, do the cleansing of the urethra
<div n="lb"/>once, the anus thrice, the left hand ten times, and both
<div n="lb"/>the hands together, seven times. After this use pure
<div n="lb"/>water (in which there is no mud or foam and which has
<div n="lb"/>no foul smell) and rinse the mouth. Take soil again
<div n="lb"/>and wash the legs with it. Rinse the mouth thrice and
<div n="lb"/>wipe the face twice. Then holding water in the hand,
<div n="lb"/>touch the apertures in the head such as eye, etc. the
<div n="lb"/>crest of the head, both upper arms, navel and heart.
<div n="lb"/>With this rinsing take bath. After bath, with the help
<div n="lb"/>of a mirror, tie the hair, anoint the eyes with collyrium,
<div n="lb"/>and wear flower garlands etc. carefully. Bathing should
<div n="lb"/>be done in river, rivulet, lake, jungle-stream, mountain
[Page661-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>or holy bath (tīrtha), or draw water from the well and
<div n="lb"/>bathe there or carry well-water home and bathe there.
<div n="lb"/>After the bath put on clean dress. Then take some
<div n="lb"/>water in the hand, offer it as oblation to gods, sages, and
<div n="lb"/>the manes with care. Throw water thrice for the
<div n="lb"/>blessing of the gods and hermits and to Prajāpati once,
<div n="lb"/>as ordained. In the same way, to the manes and the
<div n="lb"/>great ancestors also give oblation of water thrice.
<div n="NI"/>After so much is done do the customary sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>offerings, prayer etc. to Devī. Then invite guests to the
<div n="lb"/>house and welcome them. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 11).
