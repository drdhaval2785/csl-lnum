RAJI¦ (RĀJI). A prominent king of the Pūru dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>He was one of the five sons of Āyus by Svarbhānu the
<div n="lb"/>other four being Nahuṣa, Kṣatravṛddha, (Vṛddhaśarman)
<div n="lb"/>Rambha and Anenas. (Āśrama Parva, Chapter 70,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>Purāṇas contain stories that Indra destroyed people
<div n="lb"/>born in Raji's dynasty as they hated the former. That side
<div n="lb"/>in which the powerful Raji fought used to win. In a fight
<div n="lb"/>between the asuras and the Devas, when Indra felt that
<div n="lb"/>his side was losing, he secured the participation of Raji
<div n="lb"/>in the fight on condition that the latter would be given
<div n="lb"/>Indra-hood. The asuras were defeated and Raji was
<div n="lb"/>made king of svarga.
<div n="NI"/>Raji had thousands of children and they were known under
<div n="lb"/>the common name Rājeyakṣatriyas. But they were a
<div n="lb"/>foolish lot and lacked the capacity to distinguish them-
<div n="lb"/>selves in Indra's place. Therefore, at the instance of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati, preceptor of the Devas, Indra destroyed
<div n="lb"/>them all and resumed his former position and status.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha; Vāyu Purāṇa, Chapter 92,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 76; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 11; Harivaṃśa 1, 28;
<div n="lb"/>Matsya Purāṇa. Chapter 24, Verses 34-49).
