SAPTAJANĀŚRAMA¦. A holy place where seven
<div n="lb"/>hermits called the Saptajanas, went to heaven by
<div n="lb"/>standing head downwards in water. This was the
<div n="lb"/>place through which Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva went to
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā. Sugrīva told Śrī Rāma about the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Saptajanas as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“Oh! Rāghava! This vast area is the hermitage where
<div n="lb"/>rest could be taken, as sweet fruits and pure water
<div n="lb"/>could be obtained and the forest looks like a garden.
<div n="lb"/>Here the seven hermits called Saptajanas, who did
<div n="lb"/>penance and took vow and fast by standing in water
<div n="lb"/>always, with heads downwards, did live in days of
<div n="lb"/>old.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga
<div n="lb"/>13).
