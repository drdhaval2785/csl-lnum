MARUTTA I¦. A wealthy king who lived in Kṛtayuga.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order:—Brahmā, Marīci, Kaśyapa, Vivasvān, Vaivas-
<div n="lb"/>vata Manu, Mahābāhu, Prasandhi, Kṣupa, Ikṣvāku,
<div n="lb"/>Viṃśa, Kalyāṇa, Khanīnetra, Suvarcas, Karandhama
<div n="lb"/>and Marutta.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Marutta got gold.%} As soon as Marutta became
<div n="lb"/>king he began to perform a Yāga. Money was required
<div n="lb"/>for it. He was puzzled as to how to raise funds. Be-
<div n="lb"/>sides, Indra was trying to obstruct the Yāga. At last
<div n="lb"/>he consulted Nārada who told him that Bṛhaspati's
<div n="lb"/>brother Saṃvartaka was performing tapas in the forest
<div n="lb"/>and if Marutta approached him, he would give him
<div n="lb"/>enough money for this purpose. So Marutta went to
<div n="lb"/>Saṃvartaka. He advised Marutta to worship Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Marutta went to Kailāsa and got plenty
<div n="lb"/>of gold by worshipping Śiva and returned with it and
[Page490-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>began his Yāga. In spite of their efforts, Indra and other
<div n="lb"/>gods were not able to spoil Marutta's Yāga. After the
<div n="lb"/>Yāga Marutta stored up the surplus wealth in the
<div n="lb"/>neighbourhood of Himālayas where his capital was
<div n="lb"/>situated.
<div n="NI"/>After the Bhārata Yuddha, Dharmaputra was in need
<div n="lb"/>of money to re-establish his administration and for
<div n="lb"/>conducting an Aśvamedha yāga. At that time sage
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa informed him about the gold which Marutta
<div n="lb"/>had left in the neighbourhood of the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>It was by fetching that gold that the Pāṇḍavas conduct-
<div n="lb"/>ed their Aśvamedhayāga. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 3-10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marutta and Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa started on
<div n="lb"/>a triumphal tour in his Puṣpaka Vimāna with his
<div n="lb"/>followers. It was at that time that Marutta was per-
<div n="lb"/>forming his famous Yāga. The various gods were also
<div n="lb"/>present on that occasion. Alarmed at the sight of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa who was invincible by virtue of a boon he had
<div n="lb"/>received, the gods assumed the shape of different
<div n="lb"/>animals and birds. Indra became a peacock, Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>rāja (Yama) became a crow; Kubera became a
<div n="lb"/>chameleon; Varuṇa transformed himself into a swan,
<div n="lb"/>and so on. Rāvaṇa entered the precincts of the Yajña
<div n="lb"/>and said to Marutta:—“Either you fight with
<div n="lb"/>me, or else admit defeat from me.” To this Marutta
<div n="lb"/>replied calmly:—“May I know who you are?”
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa answered with a smile of contempt:—“I am
<div n="lb"/>amused at your strange pretence! Do you mean to say
<div n="lb"/>that you do not know Rāvaṇa who is the younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of Kubera? There is no one but you in all
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds, who does not know me. I have won
<div n="lb"/>the Puṣpakavimāna after defeating my elder brother.”
<div n="lb"/>Marutta retorted with bitter irony:—“As a younger
<div n="lb"/>brother who has defeated his elder brother, you are
<div n="lb"/>certainly a great man. There is no praiseworthy hero
<div n="lb"/>equal to you in all these three worlds. Do you brag
<div n="lb"/>that you have defeated your elder brother? I do not
<div n="lb"/>know whether you have received the boon by your
<div n="lb"/>righteous conduct. I have not heard the stories which
<div n="lb"/>you have told just now. You wicked fellow, stop there!
<div n="lb"/>I don't think that you will return alive!” Saying
<div n="lb"/>this Marutta took his bow and arrows and got ready
<div n="lb"/>for a fight.
<div n="NI"/>But Saṃvartaka stopped Marutta saying “O King!
<div n="lb"/>If you would please heed my advice, do not prepare
<div n="lb"/>for a fight here. We have started “Maheśvarasatra”.
<div n="lb"/>If we do not bring it to a conclusion, the whole family
<div n="lb"/>will come to an end. One who performs this Yāga
<div n="lb"/>should not be engaged in a fight. He should not even
<div n="lb"/>become a victim to anger. This Rākṣasa (Rāvaṇa) is
<div n="lb"/>invincible. Your victory is doubtful.” At this,
<div n="lb"/>Marutta put down his bow and began to occupy
<div n="lb"/>himself again with the affairs of the Yajña. Just then
<div n="lb"/>Śukra shouted, “Rāvaṇa has won.” The Rākṣasas and
<div n="lb"/>their leader Rāvaṇa continued their tour after eating
<div n="lb"/>the Maharṣis who had come to take part in the Yāga.
<div n="lb"/>After Rāvaṇa left the place, the Devas resumed their own
<div n="lb"/>forms. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other Details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Marutta flourished in Yama's assembly. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Marutta is considered as one of the “Pañcamahā-
<div n="lb"/>samrāṭs” (five great emperors). The five great emperors
[Page491-a+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>are—Yuvanāśva, Bhagīratha, Kārtavīrya, Bharata and
<div n="lb"/>Marutta. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Śiva presented him a golden peak of the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas. Indra, Bṛhaspati and other Devas attended
<div n="lb"/>Marutta's assembly. His Yajñamaṇḍapas were all
<div n="lb"/>golden. His cooks were groups of Maruts. He was able
<div n="lb"/>to make all his subjects strong and healthy. In Māhā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Droṇa Parva, Chapter 55, we see that Marutta
<div n="lb"/>ruled over the country for 1000 years as an ideal
<div n="lb"/>emperor.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Marutta received a sword from King Mucu-
<div n="lb"/>kunda. Marutta gave it to Raivata. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter, 166, Verse 77).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Marutta gave his daughter to Aṅgiras and attained
<div n="lb"/>Heaven according to Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 234. Verse 18.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) In Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha, we find a passage
<div n="lb"/>which says that since Marutta had no sons he had
<div n="lb"/>adopted Duṣyanta, a King of the Pūru dynasty, as his
<div n="lb"/>son.
