ŚIŚUMĀRA II¦. A constellation so called because it is in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a Śiśumāra (Crocodile). It is said to be
<div n="lb"/>the starry form of Viṣṇu. At the tail-end of it is
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva, which automatically rotates and also makes
<div n="lb"/>planets like the Sun and the moon to rotate. Stars
<div n="lb"/>follow the self-rotating Dhruva and rotate like a wheel.
<div n="lb"/>The Sun and the moon along with stars and planets
<div n="lb"/>are bound by the cord of atmosphere to Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>The basis and support of this constellation of Śiśumāra
<div n="lb"/>is Mahāviṣṇu, who is the support of all light and
<div n="lb"/>effulgence. Dhruva, son of Uttānapāda came to be
<div n="lb"/>installed at the tail-end of Śiśumāra as he had wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped Viṣṇu. Śiśumāra is dependent upon Viṣṇu, the
<div n="lb"/>Lord of all, and Dhruva is dependent upon Śiśumāra.
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya is dependent on Dhruva. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 9).
