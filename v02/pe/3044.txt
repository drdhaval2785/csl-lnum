KADALIGARBHĀ¦. Daughter of the great sage
<div n="lb"/>Maṅkaṇaka. There is a story about her in Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a city called Ikṣumatī. It was on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river Ikṣumatī. It was Viśvāmitra who
<div n="lb"/>set up that river and city. In a hermitage in the thick
<div n="lb"/>forest on the shores of Ikṣumatī lived a sage, Maṅka-
<div n="lb"/>ṇaka performing penance. One day the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>nymph Menakā, came there from above. As a wind
<div n="lb"/>blew, her upper garment was displaced. Seeing her
<div n="lb"/>bare body, Maṅkaṇaka had emission. The semen of
[Page363-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the sage fell into a Kadalī (plantain) tree and from
<div n="lb"/>there arose a maiden, extremely beautiful. Because she
<div n="lb"/>was born from Kadalī she was called Kadalīgarbhā.
<div n="lb"/>Kadalīgarbhā grew up into a beautiful lady and one
<div n="lb"/>day a King named Dṛḍhavarmā came that way while
<div n="lb"/>hunting and seeing Kadalīgarbhā he fell in love with her
<div n="lb"/>and married her with the permission of Maṅkaṇaka.
<div n="lb"/>The Devas advised her to scatter musṭard seeds on the
<div n="lb"/>way to her husband's house and in case her husband
<div n="lb"/>abandoned her she should be guided by the mustard
<div n="lb"/>plants to return home. She did so.
<div n="NI"/>One day by the evil advice of a barber the King
<div n="lb"/>divorced her and she returned to the Āśrama by
<div n="lb"/>following the young mustard plants. But Maṅkaṇaka
<div n="lb"/>took her back to the King. (Taraṅga 6, Madanamañ-
<div n="lb"/>jukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
