NAUBANDHANA¦. A peak of the Himālayas. The peak
<div n="lb"/>came to be known by this name on account of the
<div n="lb"/>following cause. Once upon a time Hiraṇyakaśipu stole

<div n="lb"/>and the maharṣis escaped in a boat attached to the
<div n="lb"/>horns of the Makara fish. On earth flood rose upto the

<div n="lb"/>known as Naubandhana. (nau = boat; bandha = tie).
