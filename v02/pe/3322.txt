KARATOYĀ¦. A holy river. This river worships Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>sitting in his court. (Śloka 22, Chapter 9, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva). If one stays on the shores of this river and
<div n="lb"/>observes fasting for three days one would get the bene-
<div n="lb"/>fit of performing an Aśvamedha yāga. (Chapter 85,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva).
