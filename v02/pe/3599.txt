KOṬṬUVĀ¦. (Yawning, Gape). In Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 6, there is a story explaining how the living
<div n="lb"/>beings began to yawn. After getting boons from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Vṛttrāsura swallowed Indra. The Devas were
<div n="lb"/>filled with fear and approaching Brhaspati they re-
<div n="lb"/>presented their grievance. According to the instruction
<div n="lb"/>of Bṛhaspati the Devas caused Vṛttrāsura to gape.
<div n="lb"/>After opening the mouth he found it difficult to shut,
<div n="lb"/>and the mouth remained open. In the meanwhile
<div n="lb"/>Indra jumped out of Vṛtra through the mouth. Gape
<div n="lb"/>came into existence from that time. (For details see
<div n="lb"/>under the word Vṛtra.
