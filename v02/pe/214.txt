AMOGHĀ¦. Śantanu Maharṣi's wife. Once Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>visited Śantanu Maharṣi's Āśrama. As the Maharṣi was
[Page031-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>not at home, it was Amoghā who received the guest
<div n="lb"/>with due reverence. Fascinated by the irresistible
<div n="lb"/>charm of Amoghā, Brahmā had an involuntary emis-
<div n="lb"/>sion of seminal fluid. He felt ashamed of his own weak-
<div n="lb"/>ness and left the Āśrama immediately. The Maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>who returned to the Āśrama soon after, came to know
<div n="lb"/>from his wife whose semen it was. He asked Amoghā to
<div n="lb"/>accept Brahma Deva's precious semen and not to let it
<div n="lb"/>be wasted. Being a devoted wife, she accepted it, but
<div n="lb"/>unable to bear the divine pregnancy, she deposited it
<div n="lb"/>in the water lying in the valley of the Yugandhara
<div n="lb"/>mountain. From that time, it became a place of holy
<div n="lb"/>bath, known as Lohita. It was by bathing in this holy
<div n="lb"/>water that Paraśurāma washed away his sin of annihi-
<div n="lb"/>lating the Kṣatriyas. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, 55).
