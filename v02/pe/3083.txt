KĀLA I¦.
<F>2.) Kāla and Dharma are not the same person. See under Dharma.</F>(YAMA). The god of Death. When the life
<div n="lb"/>span of each living being allotted by Brahmā is at an
<div n="lb"/>end Yama sends his agents and takes the soul to Yama-
<div n="lb"/>purī (the city of Yama). From there, the holy souls
<div n="lb"/>are sent to Vaikuṇṭha (Heaven, the abode of Viṣṇu) and
<div n="lb"/>the sinful souls to Hell.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth of Yama.%} From Mahāviṣṇu were
<div n="lb"/>descended in the following order—Brahmā, Marīci,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, Sūrya (Sun), Yama (Kāla).
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya married Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśvakarmā. They
<div n="lb"/>had three children, Manu, Yama and Yamī. Of them,
<div n="lb"/>Yama has the task of taking away the souls of those
<div n="lb"/>whose life-span is at an end. Once Saṃjñā who was
<div n="lb"/>unable to bear the dazzling brilliance of Sūrya, ordered
<div n="lb"/>her maid Chhāyā to attend on him and went to the
<div n="lb"/>forest for performing penance. Mistaking her for his
<div n="lb"/>wife Saṃjñā, Sūrya begot of her three sons namely,
<div n="lb"/>Śaniścara, Manu and Tapatī. Once Chhāyā cursed
<div n="lb"/>Yama for disobedience. Then Sūrya and Yama under-
<div n="lb"/>stood that she was not Saṃjñā. After that the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>kumāras, Revanta and Bhayā were born to Sūrya and
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā. Thus Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2 says
<div n="lb"/>that Yama was the brother of Manu, Yamī, the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinī Kumāras, Tapatī, Śanaiścara and Bhayā. Yama's
<div n="lb"/>sister Bhayā was married by the Asura, Heti. Sunīthā
<div n="lb"/>was the eldest daughter of Yama. Aṃga married her.
<div n="lb"/>The famous King Vena was her son. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part I, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Yama is a Dikpālaka.%} Once Kubera offered penance
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmā for ten thousand years in water, head down-
<div n="lb"/>wards and in the middle of Pañcāgni. Brahmā who was
<div n="lb"/>pleased, appeared before him and Kubera prayed to him
<div n="lb"/>that he should be made one of the Lokapālakas. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Brahmā ordered that thenceforth, Indra should
<div n="lb"/>rule in the East, Yama in the South, Varuṇa in the
<div n="lb"/>West and Kubera in the North. Yama's city is called
<div n="lb"/>Saṃyaminī. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Curse on Yama.%} Yama was once cursed by the sage
<div n="lb"/>Aṇi Māṇḍavya. It was as a result of it that Yama was
<div n="lb"/>born as Vidura. (For details see under Aṇimāṇḍavya).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Yama became Maharṣi.%} Śrī Rāma who returned after
<div n="lb"/>his forest life became king of Ayodhyā. He ruled over
[Page368-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the country for 11,000 years. Then it was time to recall
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu who had incarnated as Śrī Rāma, to Vai-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇṭha. Brahmā sent Yama to the earth to bring back
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma. Yama who assumed the guise of a young
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi, went to Ayodhyā and visited Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>He said that he was the disciple of the sage Atibala and
<div n="lb"/>had come to tell him a secret. So Lakṣmaṇa was posted
<div n="lb"/>at the entrance to prevent anyone from entering the
<div n="lb"/>room. It was announced that anyone who tried to enter
<div n="lb"/>would be slaughtered. After that, while Śrī Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Yama were having their secret talk, Durvāsas, the sage,
<div n="lb"/>who was hungry after a fast of 1,000 years, arrived at
<div n="lb"/>the door, asking for food. Lakṣmaṇa told him humbly
<div n="lb"/>that he could not be allowed to enter just then.
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas, who became furious, was about to curse the
<div n="lb"/>whole race of Kings. So Lakṣmaṇa entered the room
<div n="lb"/>and informed Śrī Rāma of the arrival of Durvāsas. At
<div n="lb"/>the same time, in fulfilment of the order, he was ready
<div n="lb"/>to be slaughtered. Vasiṣṭha suggested that it would be
<div n="lb"/>enough if Lakṣmaṇa was banished from the palace.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly he was expelled and he went and drowned
<div n="lb"/>himself in the depths of the river Sarayū. Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>who was broken-hearted at his separation from Lakṣ-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa went to the same river and drowned himself there
<div n="lb"/>shortly after. Yama then took their souls to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Yama became crow.%} In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa there is
<div n="lb"/>a story that at Marutta's Yāga, Yama who was frighten-
<div n="lb"/>ed at the sight of Rāvaṇa, escaped in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>crow. (For details, see under Crow).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%An Age without Yama.%} In the Purāṇas there are refe-
<div n="lb"/>rences to three periods when there was no Yama.
<div n="NI"/>(1) One such period was in Kṛtayuga. At that time
<div n="lb"/>there was no death on earth which became overcrowded
<div n="lb"/>with living beings. Unable to bear their weight, the
<div n="lb"/>earth sank down to a depth of 100 yojanas. The goddess
<div n="lb"/>of Earth offered tearful prayers to Mahāviṣṇu, who
<div n="lb"/>incarnated as Varāha (pig) and lifted up the earth 100
<div n="lb"/>yojanas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 142).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When Mārkaṇḍeya reached the age of sixteen,
<div n="lb"/>Yama went to him to take away his life. Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>hid himself behind the idol of Śiva. Yama threw his
<div n="lb"/>noose at him but it fell round Śiva's neck. Śiva opened
<div n="lb"/>his third eye and glared at Yama who was burnt to
<div n="lb"/>ashes in its fire. (See under Mārkaṇḍeya).
<div n="NI"/>(3) See under Pāñcālī, Para 1, Sub Para 2.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Yama returned Satyavān's Life.%} (See under Satyavān).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Yama and King Nṛga.%} See under Nṛga.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Yamapurī (the city of Yama).%} Yamapurī is thousand
<div n="lb"/>yojanas in extent. There is an entrance on each of the
<div n="lb"/>four sides. On one side of the city stands Citragupta's
<div n="lb"/>mansion. The fort surrounding the city is made of iron.
<div n="lb"/>There are a hundred streets in Yamapurī. They are all
<div n="lb"/>decorated with banners and festoons. There is a group of
<div n="lb"/>people in Citragupta's mansion. They are engaged in
<div n="lb"/>calculating the life-span of living beings. They take into
<div n="lb"/>account the vices and virtues of human beings. To the
<div n="lb"/>south of Citragupta's residence is situated “Jvara-
<div n="lb"/>mandira” (the abode of diseases). Adjacent to it are
<div n="lb"/>the abodes of all kinds of diseases, each disease having
<div n="lb"/>its own abode. Yama's home is situated at a distance
<div n="lb"/>of twenty yojanas from the abode of Citragupta. It has
<div n="lb"/>an area of two hundred yojanas and a height of fifty
<div n="lb"/>yojanas. It is supported by one thousand columns. On
<div n="lb"/>one side of it there is an extensive assembly hall. It is
[Page368-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>here that those who have led virtuous lives in the world,
<div n="lb"/>find their abode after death. They lead a life of eternal
<div n="lb"/>heavenly bliss there. (Garuḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Naraka (Hell).%} There is a world called Pitṛloka in
<div n="lb"/>the middle of the three worlds, on their southern side
<div n="lb"/>below the earth and above the Atala loka. The Agniṣ-
<div n="lb"/>vāttas and other piṭrs stay there in meditative trance
<div n="lb"/>for securing prosperity to those who come to pitṛloka.
<div n="lb"/>Yama is the ruler of pitṛloka. Since he is scrupulous in
<div n="lb"/>imparting justice, Yama is also called Yamadharma.
<div n="lb"/>He administers justice with an even hand to all living
<div n="lb"/>beings brought there by his agents, according to their
<div n="lb"/>virtues and vices during their earthly lives. He has
<div n="lb"/>power to assess the virtues and vices of people and to
<div n="lb"/>assign suitable punishments to them, but not to alter
<div n="lb"/>the laws or methods of punishment. Sinners are sent to
<div n="lb"/>the different Narakas by Yamadharma according to the
<div n="lb"/>nature and seriousness of their sins. The Purāṇas refer
<div n="lb"/>to twentyeight Narakas in all. They are:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Tāmisraṃ.%} Those who rob others of their wealth,
<div n="lb"/>wives, children etc, are bound with ropes by Yama's
<div n="lb"/>servants and cast into the Naraka known as Tāmisram.
<div n="lb"/>There, they are given sound beating until they faint.
<div n="lb"/>After they recover their senses, the beating is repeated
<div n="lb"/>and those who try to escape are bound hand and foot
<div n="lb"/>and pushed again into this hell. This is repeated as long
<div n="lb"/>as Fate has ordained.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Andhatāmtsram.%} This hell is intended for the wife
<div n="lb"/>who takes food after deceiving the husband or the hus-
<div n="lb"/>band who takes food after deceiving his wife. The
<div n="lb"/>punishment there is the same as that of Tāmisram except
<div n="lb"/>the beating. But the excruciating pain suffered by the
<div n="lb"/>victims on being tied fast with Yama's rope by his
<div n="lb"/>servants, makes them fall down senseless.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Rauravam.%} This is the hell into which those who
<div n="lb"/>have persecuted other living beings are cast. Those
<div n="lb"/>who seize and enjoy another man's property or resour-
<div n="lb"/>ces, also come under ‘Persecution’. When such people
<div n="lb"/>are thrown into this hell, those whom they had per-
<div n="lb"/>secuted or cheated while on earth, assume the shape
<div n="lb"/>of “ruru” and torment them severely. “Ruru” is a
<div n="lb"/>kind of dreadful serpent. This hell is known as “Raura-
<div n="lb"/>vam” because of the abundance of rurus there.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Mahārauravam.%} Here also there are ruru serpents.
<div n="lb"/>Only they are of a fiercer type. Those who deny the
<div n="lb"/>legitimate heirs, their inheritance and possess and enjoy
<div n="lb"/>others’ property, are squeezed to death by these terrible
<div n="lb"/>serpents coiling round them.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kumbhīpākam.%} This is the hell for the punishment
<div n="lb"/>of those who kill and eat birds and animals. Here, oil is
<div n="lb"/>kept boiled in huge vessels. Yama's servants plunge
<div n="lb"/>sinners into this oil. The period of their torture extends
<div n="lb"/>to as many years as there were hairs on the bodies of
<div n="lb"/>the birds or animals which they killed and ate.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Kālasūtram (Yamasūtra).%} This hell is terribly hot. It
<div n="lb"/>is here that those who do not respect their father,
<div n="lb"/>mother, elders, etc. are cast. They rush about in the
<div n="lb"/>unbearable heat of this hell and drop down exhausted,
<div n="lb"/>from time to time.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Asi(ta)patram.%} This is the hell in which those sinners
<div n="lb"/>who abandon svadharma (one's own duty) and accept
<div n="lb"/>Paradharma (others’ duty) are flogged by Yama's
<div n="lb"/>servants with whips made of asipatra (sharp-edged
<div n="lb"/>sword-shaped leaves). When they run about under
<div n="lb"/>the flogging they trip over stones and thorns and fall on
[Page369-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>their faces. Then they are stabbed with knives made of
<div n="lb"/>asipatra. They drop down unconscious and when they
<div n="lb"/>recover their senses, the same process is repeated.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Sūkaramukham.%} Kings who neglect their duties and
<div n="lb"/>oppress their subjects by misrule, are punished in this
<div n="lb"/>hell. They are crushed to a pulp by beating until they
<div n="lb"/>fall down unconscious and when they recover, they
<div n="lb"/>are again subjected to the same treatment.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Andhakūpam.%} This is the hell for punishing those
<div n="lb"/>who oppress Brāhmaṇas, gods and the poor. In this
<div n="lb"/>Kūpa (well) there are wild beasts like tiger, bear etc.
<div n="lb"/>carnivorous birds like eagle, kite etc. venomous crea-
<div n="lb"/>tures like snakes and scorpions and insects like bugs,
<div n="lb"/>mosquitoes, etc. The sinners have to endure the cons-
<div n="lb"/>tant attacks of these creatures, until the expiry of the
<div n="lb"/>period of their punishment.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Kṛmibhojanam (Food for worms).%} Depraved Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas who take their food without worshipping gods
<div n="lb"/>and honouring guests, are thrown into this “Kṛmi-
<div n="lb"/>bhojana” Naraka which is one lakh yojanas in extent.
<div n="lb"/>Worms, insects and serpents sting them and eat them up.
<div n="lb"/>Once their bodies are completely eaten up by these
<div n="lb"/>creatures, they are provided with new bodies, which
<div n="lb"/>are also eaten up in the above manner. They have to
<div n="lb"/>continue there in this manner, till the end of their term
<div n="lb"/>of punishment.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Taptamūrti.%} Those who plunder or steal other
<div n="lb"/>people's gold, jewels, ornaments or money are cast
<div n="lb"/>into the furnaces of this Naraka, which is built of iron
<div n="lb"/>and always remains red hot with blazing fire.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Śālmali.%} This Naraka is intended for men and
<div n="lb"/>women who have committed adultery. A figure made of
<div n="lb"/>iron, heated red-hot is placed there. The victim is
<div n="lb"/>urged to embrace it. Yama's servants flog the victim
<div n="lb"/>from behind.
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Vajrakaṇṭakaśāli.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
<div n="lb"/>of those who have unnatural intercourse with cows and
<div n="lb"/>other animals. Here, the guilty people are made to
<div n="lb"/>embrace iron images full of diamond needles.
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Vaitaraṇī.%} This is the Naraka for Kings who have
<div n="lb"/>violated all ordinances of Śāstras and for adulterers. It
<div n="lb"/>is the most terrible place of punishment. Vaitaraṇī is
<div n="lb"/>a river filled with human excreta, urine, blood, hair,
<div n="lb"/>bones, nails, flesh, fat and all kinds of dirty substances.
<div n="lb"/>There are various kinds of ferocious beasts in it. Those
<div n="lb"/>who are cast into it are attacked and mauled by these
<div n="lb"/>creatures from all sides. The sinners have to spend the
<div n="lb"/>term of their punishment, feeding upon the contents of
<div n="lb"/>this river.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Pūyodakam.%} This is a well, filled with excreta,
<div n="lb"/>urine, blood, phlegm etc. Brāhmaṇas and others who
<div n="lb"/>have intercourse with women of low caste against
<div n="lb"/>customs, ordinances etc. vagabonds who wander about
<div n="lb"/>irresponsibly like animals and birds and other such
<div n="lb"/>sinners are cast into this Naraka.
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Prāṇarodham.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
<div n="lb"/>of Brāhmaṇas who keep dogs, asses and other mean
<div n="lb"/>animals and constantly hunt and kill animals for food.
<div n="lb"/>Here the servants of Yama gather round the sinners and
<div n="lb"/>cut them limb by limb with their arrows and subject
<div n="lb"/>them to constant insult.
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Viśasanam.%} This Naraka is for the torture of those
<div n="lb"/>who perform Yāga by killing cows to display their
<div n="lb"/>wealth and splendour. They will have to remain there
[Page369-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>during the whole term of their punishment under the
<div n="lb"/>constant flogging of Yama's servants.
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Lālābhakṣam.%} This is the Naraka for lustful people.
<div n="lb"/>The lascivious fellow who makes his wife swallow
<div n="lb"/>semen, is cast into this hell. Lālābhakṣam is a sea of
<div n="lb"/>semen. The sinner lies in it feeding upon semen alone.
<div n="NI"/>(19) {%Sārameyāśanam.%} Those guilty of unsocial acts
<div n="lb"/>like incendiarism, poisoning food, mass slaughter,
<div n="lb"/>ruining the country, etc. are cast into the Naraka
<div n="lb"/>called Sārameyāśana. There, nothing but the flesh of
<div n="lb"/>dogs is available for food. There are 700 dogs in that
<div n="lb"/>Naraka and all of them are as ferocious as leopards.
<div n="lb"/>They attack the sinners who come there from all sides
<div n="lb"/>and tear their flesh from their bodies with their teeth.
<div n="NI"/>(20) {%Avīci.%} This Naraka is for those guilty of bearing
<div n="lb"/>false witness, false swearing or assuming false names.
<div n="lb"/>They are hurled into Avīci from a mountain which is
<div n="lb"/>100 yojanas in height. The whole region of Avīci is
<div n="lb"/>always shaken like an ocean with turbulent waves. As
<div n="lb"/>soon as the sinners fall into it they are utterly smashed
<div n="lb"/>into dust. They are again restored to life and the
<div n="lb"/>punishment is repeated.
<div n="NI"/>(21) {%Ayaḥpānam.%} Those who belong to the first three
<div n="lb"/>castes—viz. Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas—who
<div n="lb"/>indulge in drinking Soma, Surā etc. are bound and
<div n="lb"/>thrown into this hell. They are forced to drink melted
<div n="lb"/>iron in liquid form.
<div n="NI"/>(22) {%Kṣhārakardamam.%} Braggarts and those who insult
<div n="lb"/>people of noble birth are cast into this hell. Here,
<div n="lb"/>Yama's servants keep the sinners upside down and
<div n="lb"/>torture them in various ways.
<div n="NI"/>(23) {%Rakṣobhakṣam.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
<div n="lb"/>of meat-eaters. There are separate compartments in
<div n="lb"/>this hell for those who perform human sacrifice, eat
<div n="lb"/>human flesh or the flesh of other creatures. All the
<div n="lb"/>living beings they had killed before, would have arrived
<div n="lb"/>here in advance. They would all join together in
<div n="lb"/>attacking, biting and mauling these sinners. Their
<div n="lb"/>shrieks and complaints would be of no avail there.
<div n="NI"/>(24) {%Śūlaprotam.%} People who take the life of others
<div n="lb"/>who have done no harm to them, by deceiving them
<div n="lb"/>or by treachery, with weapons like the trident, are
<div n="lb"/>thrown into the “Śūlaprotam” hell. Yama's servants
<div n="lb"/>fix each of the sinners of the above class, on the top
<div n="lb"/>of a trident. They are forced to spend the whole term
<div n="lb"/>of their punishment in that position, suffering intense
<div n="lb"/>thirst and hunger, enduring all the tortures inflicted on
<div n="lb"/>them by Yama's servants.
<div n="NI"/>(25) {%Dandaśūkam.%} Sinners who persecute fellow
<div n="lb"/>creatures like venomous serpents are cast into this
<div n="lb"/>Naraka. There are many wild beasts and many hooded
<div n="lb"/>serpents here. They eat alive, the sinners who fall into
<div n="lb"/>this hell.
<div n="NI"/>(26) {%Vaṭarodham.%} This hell is for those who persecute
<div n="lb"/>the creatures living on mountain-peaks, dense forests,
<div n="lb"/>hollow trunks of trees, etc. It resembles mountains,
<div n="lb"/>caves, forests etc. After throwing them into this hell
<div n="lb"/>the sinners are tortured with fire, snake, poison and
<div n="lb"/>weapons, just as they had tortured other creatures,
<div n="lb"/>while on earth.
<div n="NI"/>(27) {%Paryāvartanakam.%} One who denies food to a
<div n="lb"/>person who happens to come at meal-time and abuses
<div n="lb"/>him, is thrown into this Naraka. The moment he falls
<div n="lb"/>into it, his eyes are put out by being pierced with the
[Page370-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>beaks of cruel birds like the crow, eagle etc. It is the
<div n="lb"/>most painful experience for them.
<div n="NI"/>(28) {%Sūcīmukham.%} Proud and miserly people who
<div n="lb"/>refuse to spend money even for the bare necessities of
<div n="lb"/>life, find their place in this hell. Those who do not
<div n="lb"/>repay the money they have borrowed, will also be cast
<div n="lb"/>into this hell. Here, their bodies will be continually
<div n="lb"/>pricked and pierced with needles. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>8th Skandha; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Mantra (incantation) to invoke Yama.%}
<Poem>“Mahiṣastha Yamāgaccha
<div n="lb"/>daṇḍahasta mahābala /
<div n="lb"/>rakṣa tvaṃ dakṣiṇadvāraṃ
<div n="lb"/>Vaivasvata namo'stu te”. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>After invoking Yama with this mantra, one should
<div n="lb"/>worship with the mantra “Vaivasvataṃ Saṃgamanam”.
<div n="lb"/>(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 56).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Yama Defeated by Rāvaṇa.%} Once the sage Nārada
<div n="lb"/>went to Rāvaṇa and expatiated on the glory and splen-
<div n="lb"/>dour of Yama. Immediately Rāvaṇa set out to Saṃya-
<div n="lb"/>manī with the intention of subduing Yama. Accepting
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's challenge, Yama came out. After a terrible
<div n="lb"/>battle between them, which lasted for seven days neither
<div n="lb"/>of them was able to defeat the other. Both of them
<div n="lb"/>had received Brahmā's boon. In the night of the
<div n="lb"/>seventh day, Yama rushed forth with his staff to beat
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa to death. Then Rāvaṇa took his Brahmāstra.
<div n="lb"/>At that critical moment, Brahmā came to the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field and persuaded Yama to withdraw from the fight.
<div n="lb"/>Yama retreated to his city and closed the gate.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa went back with a triumphant shout. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Other details concerning Yama.%}
