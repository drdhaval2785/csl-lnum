NIŚĀKARA II¦. A great muni, who attained Svarga
<div n="lb"/>after passing through many lives. His story is given
<div n="lb"/>below:—
<div n="NI"/>There was a great ascetic and erudite scholar in all
<div n="lb"/>branches of knowledge called Kośakāra, son of muni
<div n="lb"/>Mudgala. Kośakāra's wife was Dharmiṣṭhā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Vātsyāyana. To them was born a son, an idiot and a
<div n="lb"/>deaf and dumb child, whom they forsook at the gates
<div n="lb"/>of the mother's house. At the same time an evil-minded
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa woman called Śūrpākṣī, who was in the habit
<div n="lb"/>of lifting children came there with a lean child. She re-
<div n="lb"/>placed Dharmiṣṭhā's child with the lean one and
<div n="lb"/>returned with it to the Śālobharaparvata where her
<div n="lb"/>blind husband asked her what she had brought for his
<div n="lb"/>food. She told him about the changeling child with her
<div n="lb"/>when he said as follows “Return the child at once to
<div n="lb"/>where it was found. The child's father is a great man of
<div n="lb"/>knowledge and wisdom and when he hears about your
<div n="lb"/>action, he will curse us. So, return the child and bring the
<div n="lb"/>child of some one else.” As soon as she heard these words
<div n="lb"/>of her husband she rose up in the sky in great alarm.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the cries of the Rākṣasa child left at their
<div n="lb"/>gates Dharmiṣṭhā and her husband came out, and
<div n="lb"/>the child which, in its colour and shape resembled their
<div n="lb"/>child exactly, Kośakāra said thus: “Oh! Dharmiṣṭhā!
<div n="lb"/>this must be some ghost. Some one is lying here in the
<div n="lb"/>same form as our child to hoodwink and cheat us.”
[Page541-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Saying so he tied the child to the ground by chanting
<div n="lb"/>mantras with darbha grass in his hands.
<div n="NI"/>At the same time Śūrpākṣī came there in invisible form.
<div n="lb"/>She threw Dharmiṣṭhā's child from a distance into the
<div n="lb"/>courtyard. Kośakāra took his child. But all the attempts
<div n="lb"/>of the Rākṣasī to lift her child from the ground failed.
<div n="lb"/>The grief-stricken Rākṣasī reported the matter to her
<div n="lb"/>husband.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as Śūrpākṣī left the place the magnanimous
<div n="lb"/>Kośakāra handed over the Rākṣasa child to his wife.
<div n="lb"/>He brought up his own child by feeding it on cow's milk,
<div n="lb"/>curd, juice of sugar-cane etc. Both the children grew
<div n="lb"/>up to seven years of age. The Rākṣasa boy was named
<div n="lb"/>Divākara and the other child Niśākara. Both the child-
<div n="lb"/>ren were invested with the sacred thread in due course
<div n="lb"/>of time. Divākara learned the Vedas, but Niśākara did
<div n="lb"/>not, and he was despised by all. His father pushed
<div n="lb"/>him into a neglected well and covered its mouth with
<div n="lb"/>stone.
<div n="NI"/>Niśākara lived in the well for many years. The fruits
<div n="lb"/>of a cluster of plants in the well served as his food. Some
<div n="lb"/>ten years afterwards when Niśākara's mother found the
<div n="lb"/>mouth of the well closed with a big stone she asked
<div n="lb"/>as to who did so, and from the well came the answer,
<div n="lb"/>“Mother, it was father who covered this well with that
<div n="lb"/>stone.” Alarmed at this the mother asked who was with-
<div n="lb"/>in the well, and she was answered, “Your son, Niśākara.”
<div n="lb"/>Then she argued that her son was named Divākara and
<div n="lb"/>that she had no son called Niśākara. But, Niśākara
<div n="lb"/>told her about his past life and what had happened
<div n="lb"/>to him during the present life, upon which the mother
<div n="lb"/>rolled away the stone and Niśākara came out of the
<div n="lb"/>well and prostrated before his mother. He then went
<div n="lb"/>home with his mother. Questioned as to how and why
<div n="lb"/>these things happened by Kośakāra his son Niśākara
<div n="lb"/>described his previous life as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Father, you would please hear about the reason why I
<div n="lb"/>became dumb and idiotic. In my previous life I was
<div n="lb"/>born in a noble family, my father being called Vṛṣākapi
<div n="lb"/>and mother Mālā. My father taught me all the Śāstras
<div n="lb"/>and the Vedas. I became conceited over my unique learn-
<div n="lb"/>ing and erudition and began doing evil acts. Conceit
<div n="lb"/>led to avarice, and I lost all my scholarship. I became
<div n="lb"/>indiscreet. Having thus become a fool, I began com-
<div n="lb"/>mitting sins. I had to hang myself to death on account
<div n="lb"/>of my association with others' women and stealing
<div n="lb"/>others’ money. I, therefore, fell into the Raurava hell.
<div n="lb"/>After a thousand years some sin remained attached to
<div n="lb"/>me as a result of which I was born as a tiger, and a
<div n="lb"/>King trapped and took me to his city When
<div n="lb"/>I was caged Śāstras about Dharma, Artha and
<div n="lb"/>Kāma came up in my mind.
<div n="NI"/>One day the King went out wearing only one piece of
<div n="lb"/>cloth and with a club in his hands. Then his wife Ajitā,
<div n="lb"/>a unique beauty came to me, and because of my taste
<div n="lb"/>in my previous life sexual desire arose in my heart. I
<div n="lb"/>told her about my feelings. She also felt like me. So,
<div n="lb"/>she unchained me and I approached her in great passion
<div n="lb"/>and seeing me thus the King's servants tied me to a
<div n="lb"/>peepal tree and thrashed me to death.
<div n="NI"/>My soul again returned to hell. After a thousand years
<div n="lb"/>I was born as a white ass in the house of a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Agniveśya, who had many wives. Then all
<div n="lb"/>knowledge and wisdom were reflected in my mind. My
<div n="lb"/>duty was to carry the brahmin women on my back. One
[Page541-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>day the brahmin's wife Vimati of Navarāṣṭra started
<div n="lb"/>for her father's home mounted on my back. Half-way
<div n="lb"/>home she dismounted and went to a stream to bathe.
<div n="lb"/>The exquisite beauty of that lady with wet clothes up-
<div n="lb"/>set me, and I ran up to her on the stream, pushed her
<div n="lb"/>into the water and myself fell upon her. Then a person
<div n="lb"/>came and tried to tie me down. I escaped from his
<div n="lb"/>grips and ran southwards. While thus running the
<div n="lb"/>saddle slipped into my mouth and I fell down. And,
<div n="lb"/>within six days I died thinking about her. Thus I fell
<div n="lb"/>again into hell. My next birth was as a parrot. A
<div n="lb"/>hunter caged me in the forest and he sold me to a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya merchant, who put me up in the women's
<div n="lb"/>quarters. The young women fed me on rice and fruits.
<div n="lb"/>One day the wife of the Vaiśya merchant hugged me
<div n="lb"/>to her breast and petted me. Her touch kindled in me
<div n="lb"/>sexual feelings and I embraced her with my wings. In
<div n="lb"/>my hurry about the affair I slipped down and got
<div n="lb"/>crushed between the doors. Thus I fell again into hell.
<div n="NI"/>Afterwards I was born as an ox in a camp of a
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍāla. One day he yoked me to his cart and
<div n="lb"/>started for the forest in it with his wife. On the way
<div n="lb"/>she sang a song, and mentally excited by it I looked
<div n="lb"/>back. At once I slipped my feet, fell down and died.
<div n="lb"/>Again I returned to hell.
<div n="NI"/>After another one hundred years I was born as your
<div n="lb"/>(Kośakārad) son in this house. All facts about my
<div n="lb"/>previous lives linger in my memory and now I am free
<div n="lb"/>from evils and am a virtuous person. I am going to the
<div n="lb"/>forest for tapas. Let the good boy, Divākara live here
<div n="lb"/>as house-holder. Niśākara thus did tapas for many
<div n="lb"/>years and attained Vaikuṇṭha (Vāmana Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 91).
<div n="NI"/>There is no definite evidence in the Purāṇas to estab-
<div n="lb"/>lish that the Niśākara, the protector of Sampāti and
<div n="lb"/>the Niśākara mentioned above were the same person.
