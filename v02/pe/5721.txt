ṚBHU I¦. An ancient sage. He was the son of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>He was an extraordinary scholar who became the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor of Nidāgha who was the son of Pulastya and
<div n="lb"/>the grandson of Brahmā. Ṛbhu conveyed all know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge to Nidāgha. But he saw that although he taught
<div n="lb"/>Nidāgha all branches of knowledge, the latter did
<div n="lb"/>not take any interest in “Advaita”. So he left him
<div n="lb"/>in disappointment but later got him interested in
<div n="lb"/>Advaita. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2. Chapters 15-16).
