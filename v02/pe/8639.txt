VṚṢĀDARBHI II¦. A famous son of Śibi. The follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing is a story given in Mahābhārata about this Vṛṣā-
<div n="lb"/>darbhi.
<div n="NI"/>Once the seven hermits started for going round the earth.
<div n="lb"/>At this time Vṛṣādarbhi had been performing a sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice. Vṛṣādarbhi invoked the seven hermits and gave them
<div n="lb"/>his son as a gift. The child died before long. As famine
<div n="lb"/>was prevailing everywhere the hermits were weak and
[Page882-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>worn out by hunger. They wished to eat the flesh of
<div n="lb"/>the child. Vṛṣādarbhi tried to dissuade the hermits
<div n="lb"/>from this beastly action in vain. At last the angry King
<div n="lb"/>created a wicked fairy to kill the hermits. Though the
<div n="lb"/>fairy attacked the hermits, Indra, who had lived with
<div n="lb"/>the seven hermits killed the fairy.
<div n="NI"/>Vṛṣādarbhi was not at all behind his father Śibi in
<div n="lb"/>liberality. There are various stories in Mahābhārata to
<div n="lb"/>illustrate this.
