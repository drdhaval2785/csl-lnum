VIHUṆḌA¦. An asura. This asura was the son of the mighty
<div n="lb"/>and great Asura Huṇḍa. At the time of the fierce battle
<div n="lb"/>between the devas and the asuras, this mighty asura
<div n="lb"/>Huṇḍa and Nahuṣa confronted each other and Huṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>was killed. After this Vihuṇḍa, the son of Huṇḍa fought
<div n="lb"/>with Nahuṣa. In the earlier part of the battle Vihuṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>and his army suffered defeat. Vihuṇḍa began to do
<div n="lb"/>penance in order to defeat the Devas who got terrified
<div n="lb"/>at this and went to Mahāviṣṇu and prayed for protect-
<div n="lb"/>ion. Viṣṇu consoled them saying that he would take
<div n="lb"/>necessary steps. When the Devas were gone, Viṣṇu took
<div n="lb"/>the form of a beautiful woman and went in search of
<div n="lb"/>Vihuṇḍa. They met each other in the garden Nandana.
<div n="lb"/>Vihuṇḍa fell in love with her. He wanted to marry her.
<div n="lb"/>She said, “Oh, Handsome Vihuṇḍa, I have no objection
<div n="lb"/>to be your wife. But there is a condition, you, must
<div n="lb"/>gather seven crores of Kāmoda flowers and offer them
<div n="lb"/>as oblation to Śiva, and then make a garland of
<div n="lb"/>Kāmoda flowers and put it on my neck. From that
<div n="lb"/>day onwards I am yours.”
<div n="NI"/>Vihuṇḍa agreed to it. He went for the flowers. He
<div n="lb"/>wandered over forests and mountains. Nobody had any
<div n="lb"/>idea of such a tree or flower. Thinking that this condi-
<div n="lb"/>tion, laid by the damsel, was a deceit played upon him,
[Page853-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>he stood perplexed when the hermit Śukra saw him.
<div n="lb"/>He told the hermit everything. Then Śukra told him,
<div n="lb"/>“Kāmoda is neither a tree nor a flower. She is goddess
<div n="lb"/>who came up from the sea of Milk at the time of the
<div n="lb"/>churning. She dwells at Gaṅgādvāra. When she laughs
<div n="lb"/>pure white fragrant flowers fall from her lips, on the
<div n="lb"/>water of Gaṅgā, every moment. When she is sad, the
<div n="lb"/>flowers that fall from her lips will be red.”
<div n="NI"/>Vihuṇḍa started for Gaṅgādvāra. Nārada knew this.
<div n="lb"/>He came to Vihuṇḍa and said, “It is difficult to reach
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādvāra and please Kāmodā, and obtain the flower.
<div n="lb"/>So the easiest way is to gather the flowers that come
<div n="lb"/>down through the water of Gaṅgā.” Vihuṇḍa agreed.
<div n="lb"/>He took his seat on the bank of Gaṅgā and waited for
<div n="lb"/>the flowers to come.
<div n="NI"/>Nārada decided to cause harm to Vihuṇḍa. So he went
<div n="lb"/>to Kāmodā and by way of telling her news, he inform-
<div n="lb"/>ed her that the hermit Bhṛgu had cursed Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and changed him into a man. On hearing this Kāmodā
<div n="lb"/>began to cry. Red flowers fell from her lips. They were
<div n="lb"/>carried down in cluster by the water of Gaṅgā. Vihuṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>gathered them and went to the dwelling place of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Pārvatī saw this by their inward eyes. Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>did not like the idea of offering red flowers at the feet
<div n="lb"/>of her beloved husband. Śiva found out a remedy for
<div n="lb"/>it. He advised Pārvatī to offer pure white flowers at his
<div n="lb"/>feet standing as a boy. Vihuṇḍa came with red flowers
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī appeared in the form of a boy. Both began to
<div n="lb"/>vie with each other in offering flowers at the feet of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Gradually it changed to a fight between the boy
<div n="lb"/>and Vihuṇḍa. In the fight Vihuṇḍa was killed. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Bhūmi khaṇḍa, some chapters from 119).
