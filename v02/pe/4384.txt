MANUṢYA¦ (MAN) The Purāṇas have not given a
<div n="lb"/>definite explanation regarding the origin of Man, the
<div n="lb"/>most important of all living beings. Many stories
<div n="lb"/>regarding the origin of Man were current among the
<div n="lb"/>ancient people. According to Hindu Purāṇas Man
<div n="lb"/>was born of Svāyambhuva Manu who in turn was born
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. According to Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa (Sarga 14,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Kāṇḍa) all the living beings including man
<div n="lb"/>were born to Kaśyapaprajāpati of his eight wives,
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu
<div n="lb"/>and Analā. From Aditi were born the devas; from
<div n="lb"/>Diti, the daityas; from Danu, the dānavas; from Kālī,
<div n="lb"/>the asuras Kālaka and Naraka; from Tāmrā, the bird-
<div n="lb"/>flock Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Sukī;
<div n="lb"/>from Krodhavaśā the animal flock, Mṛgī, Mṛgamandā,
<div n="lb"/>Harī, Bhadramadā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Svetā and
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi; from Manu, mankind and from Analā, the
<div n="lb"/>flora.
<div n="NI"/>There is basis to believe that the Greeks and the people
<div n="lb"/>of Bhārata accepted with slight modifications the
<div n="lb"/>theory of evolution. The Daśāvatāras of Viṣṇu almost
<div n="lb"/>represents the progressive changes in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>living thing from a fish into man. The theory of
<div n="lb"/>Darwin that life was first formed in water was current
<div n="lb"/>among the sages of ancient Bhārata, even from very
<div n="lb"/>early times.
<Poem>Apa eva sasarjādau
<div n="lb"/>Tāsu vīryamapāsṛjat // </Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(He created water first and cast virility therein).
<div n="NI"/>In the Daśāvatāras (ten incarnations of Viṣṇu) the
<div n="lb"/>first avatāra is Matsya (Fish). The next one is Kūrma
<div n="lb"/>or Tortoise which is a progress in the form of fish.
<div n="lb"/>The third is Varāha or boar which is another step
<div n="lb"/>forward in evolution. The fourth is Narasiṃha (Man
<div n="lb"/>cum lion) which is the first step towards the formation
<div n="lb"/>of Man. That avatāra has got the traits of both man
<div n="lb"/>and animal. The next one is Vāmana or a small man.
<div n="lb"/>Then Śrī Rāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa, both fully grown men
<div n="lb"/>but with different kinds of culture.
