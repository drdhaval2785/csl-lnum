AMṚTAM¦. A delicious and precious food obtained from
<div n="lb"/>the ocean of Milk when the Devas and Asuras churned
<div n="lb"/>it. In Chapter 152 of Agni Purāṇa, the word “Mṛtam”
<div n="lb"/>is defined as wealth received by begging and “Amṛtam”
<div n="lb"/>as wealth received without begging, and “Prāmṛtam”
<div n="lb"/>as another kind of wealth obtained without begging.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Cause of Kṣīrābdhi-mathanam.%} (Churning of the Sea
<div n="lb"/>of Milk)—Once when Maharṣi Durvāsas was travelling
<div n="lb"/>through a forest, he met the Apsarā woman, Menakā,
<div n="lb"/>with a garland of Kalpaka flowers in her hand. The
<div n="lb"/>fragrance of the flowers filled the whole forest. Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>approached Menakā and requested her to give the gar-
<div n="lb"/>land to him. The Vidyādharī (Apsarā woman) prostrat-
<div n="lb"/>ed before the Maharṣi with reverence and presented
<div n="lb"/>the garland to him. Wearing that garland on his hair,
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas went to devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>There he saw Indra riding on his elephant, Airāvata,
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by his retinue of Devas. The Maharṣi took
<div n="lb"/>the rare garland from his head and presented it to
<div n="lb"/>Indra, the King of Devas. Indra received the garland
<div n="lb"/>and placed it on Airāvata's head. The elephant was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by the fragrance of the garland and took it in
[Page031-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>its trunk, examined it by smelling it and then threw it
<div n="lb"/>on the ground.
<div n="NI"/>Durvāsas, who became angry at the way in which his
<div n="lb"/>garland was slighted by Indra said to him: “Since
<div n="lb"/>you have treated my garland with disrespect, the glory
<div n="lb"/>and prosperity of devaloka will perish!” On hearing
<div n="lb"/>the curse, Indra alighted from the elephant, frightened.
<div n="lb"/>He begged pardon of the Maharṣi. The furious Muni
<div n="lb"/>continued: “I am not soft-hearted; nor am I of a for-
<div n="lb"/>giving nature. Other Munis may forgive. Remember, I
<div n="lb"/>am Durvāsas. You have become so haughty because
<div n="lb"/>other Munis like Vasiṣṭha and Gautama have been flat-
<div n="lb"/>tering you too much.” Having said this Durvāsas went
<div n="lb"/>his way. Indra returned to Amarāvatī.
<div n="NI"/>From that day the glory of devaloka began to decline.
<div n="lb"/>The three worlds became dull. Even the plants and
<div n="lb"/>shrubs began to wither. The performance of yāgas came
<div n="lb"/>to an end. The Devas began to be affected by the
<div n="lb"/>infirmities of old age. Taking advantage of this situation,
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras started preparations for opposing the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>Under the oppression of the Asuras, the Devas groaned
<div n="lb"/>in distress. Led by Agni Deva they sought refuge under
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Brahmā led them to Mahāviṣṇu. They all join-
<div n="lb"/>ed in praising Viṣṇu who appeared and told them like
<div n="lb"/>this: “O Gods! I shall enhance your glory. Do as I
<div n="lb"/>tell you. Along with the Asuras bring all kinds of medi-
<div n="lb"/>cinal herbs and deposit them in the ocean of Milk.
<div n="lb"/>Obtain Amṛtam from it by churning it with Mahāmeru
<div n="lb"/>as the churning staff and Vāsuki as the rope. The
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtam (Amṛta) which will be produced by churning
<div n="lb"/>the Milk sea, will make you strong and deathless. I
<div n="lb"/>shall see that the Asuras will share in your troubles but
<div n="lb"/>not in enjoying Amṛtam.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Churning of the Milk Sea.%} After Viṣṇu had vanished,
<div n="lb"/>the Devas made a treaty with the Asuras and began to
<div n="lb"/>work for getting Amṛtam. All of them joined together
<div n="lb"/>in bringing various kinds of medicinal herbs and after
<div n="lb"/>putting them in the Milk sea which was as clear as the
<div n="lb"/>cloudless sky, began to churn it, using Manthara Moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain as the churning staff and snake Vāsuki as the rope.
<div n="lb"/>The party of Devas was posted at the tail-end of Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>while the Asuras took their stand at the head. The
<div n="lb"/>Asuras became enervated by the fiery breath coming out
<div n="lb"/>of Vāsuki's mouth. The clouds which were blown by
<div n="lb"/>that breath invigorated the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu transformed himself into a tortoise, and
<div n="lb"/>sitting in the middle of the Milk Sea served as the
<div n="lb"/>foundation for the Manthara Mountain, the churning
<div n="lb"/>staff. Assuming another form, invisible both to Devas
<div n="lb"/>and Asuras, Mahāviṣṇu pressed down the Manthara
<div n="lb"/>Mountain from above.
<div n="NI"/>While churning the Milk Sea like this, the first object
<div n="lb"/>that rose to the surface was Kāmadhenu. Both Devas
<div n="lb"/>and Asuras were strongly attracted towards Kāmadhenu
<div n="lb"/>While all were standing spellbound, Vāruṇīdevī with
<div n="lb"/>her enchanting dreamy eyes next appeared on the sur-
<div n="lb"/>face. Pārijātam was the third to appear. Fourth, a group
<div n="lb"/>of Apsarā women of marvellous beauty floated up. The
<div n="lb"/>Moon appeared as the fifth. Śiva received the Moon.
<div n="lb"/>The venom which came out of the Milk Sea as the
<div n="lb"/>sixth item, was absorbed by Nāgas. After that arose
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān Dhanvantari, dressed in pure white robes
<div n="lb"/>and carrying a Kamaṇḍalu in his hand filled with
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtam. All were delighted at this sight. Next Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī made her appearance in all her glory with a
[Page032-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>lotus in her hand and seated in an open lotus flower.
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas sang celestial songs in her presence;
<div n="lb"/>Apsarā women danced. For her bath, the Gaṅgā river
<div n="lb"/>arrived there with her tributaries. The Milk Sea itself
<div n="lb"/>took on physical form and offered her a garland of ever-
<div n="lb"/>fresh lotus flowers. Brahmā bedecked her with orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments. After that Lakṣmīdevī, fully adorned in all her
<div n="lb"/>magnificent jewels, in the presence of all Devas, joined
<div n="lb"/>the bosom of Mahāviṣṇu. The Asuras were displeased
<div n="lb"/>at it. They snatched the pot of Amṛtam from Dhan-
<div n="lb"/>vantari and fled away.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Amṛtam was recovered.%} With the loss of Amṛtam,
<div n="lb"/>the Devas were in a fix. They began to consider how
<div n="lb"/>the pot of Amṛtam could be recovered. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu transformed himself into a celestial virgin,
<div n="lb"/>Mohinī, of extraordinary beauty. She approached the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras as a shy girl. The Asuras were enchanted by
<div n="lb"/>her surpassing beauty. They asked her, “Who are
<div n="lb"/>you?” Looking down on the ground, Mohinī replied:
<div n="lb"/>“I am the little sister of Dhanvantari. By the time I
<div n="lb"/>came out of the Milk Sea, the Devas and Asuras had
<div n="lb"/>already gone. Being lonely I am going about in search
<div n="lb"/>of a suitable mate.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing her words, the Asuras began to make
<div n="lb"/>friends with her one by one, determined not to waste
<div n="lb"/>this opportunity. They told her that she should distri-
<div n="lb"/>bute Amṛtam to all of them and in the end she should
<div n="lb"/>marry one of them. Mohinī agreed, but added: “All
<div n="lb"/>of you should close your eyes. I shall serve Amṛtam
<div n="lb"/>to all. He who opens his eyes last, must serve Amṛtam
<div n="lb"/>to me and he will marry me”.
<div n="NI"/>All of them accepted this condition. They sat in front
<div n="lb"/>of Mohinī with closed eyes. In a moment Mohinī left
<div n="lb"/>the place with the pot of Amṛtam and went to deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rāhu's neck is cut.%} When the Asuras opened their
<div n="lb"/>eyes, Mohinī was not to be seen. Finding that they
<div n="lb"/>were betrayed, they were in great perplexity. All of
<div n="lb"/>them pursued Mohinī to devaloka. Devas had put
<div n="lb"/>the Sun and Moon gods on guard duty at the gates
<div n="lb"/>of devaloka. At the instance of the Asuras, Rāhu in
<div n="lb"/>disguise entered the divine assembly chamber. The
<div n="lb"/>Sun and Moon gods detected him and Viṣṇu with his
<div n="lb"/>weapon, Sudarśana Cakra cut open his neck. Swearing
<div n="lb"/>that he would wreak vengeance on the Sun and Moon
<div n="lb"/>Rāhu returned. In the 8th Skandha of Bhāgavata it is
<div n="lb"/>said that even now from time to time Rāhu swallows
<div n="lb"/>the Sun and Moon, but they escape through the open
<div n="lb"/>gash in his neck and this is known as solar eclipse and
<div n="lb"/>lunar eclipse.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Defeat of the Asuras.%} Indra and all other gods took
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtam. The enraged Asuras attacked the gods, who
<div n="lb"/>had gained strength and vigour by taking Amṛtam.
<div n="lb"/>The Asuras were driven away in all directions. All the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds began to enjoy glory and prosperity again.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kalakūṭa.%} The story of how the deadly poison,
<div n="lb"/>Kālakūṭa arose at the churning of the ocean of Milk,
<div n="lb"/>is given in M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 18, Verses 42-45,
<div n="lb"/>as follows: After many precious things had come up
<div n="lb"/>Kālakūṭa poison with fumes and flames, appeared on
<div n="lb"/>the surface of the ocean. Its strong smell caused a
<div n="lb"/>stupor in all the three worlds. Fearing that the world
<div n="lb"/>will perish, Brahmā requested Śiva to swallow that
<div n="lb"/>poison. Śiva gulped it down, but stopped it in his
<div n="lb"/>throat. From that day he became “Nīlakaṇṭha”.
[Page032-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The story of Airāvata.%} Indra's tusker Airāvata was
<div n="lb"/>responsible for the churning of the ocean of Milk. But
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 18, Verse 42
<div n="lb"/>it is said that a white elephant with four tusks arose
<div n="lb"/>during the churning of the ocean of Milk and that
<div n="lb"/>Devendra caught and tamed it. This is an obvious
<div n="lb"/>contradiction. Besides, in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kāṇḍa, 14th Sarga, the wounded Jaṭāyu describing his
<div n="lb"/>family history to Śrī Rāma, gives the following account
<div n="lb"/>about the origin of Airāvata:
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa, one of the Prajāpatis, married the eight
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa. One of them named Krodhavaśā
<div n="lb"/>had ten daughters by Kaśyapa. They were: Mṛgī, Mrga-
<div n="lb"/>madā, Hari, Bhadramadā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūli, Śvetā,
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi, Surasā and Kadru. Of them Bhadramadā
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to a daughter, Irāvati. The tusker Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>is Irāvatī's son.
<div n="NI"/>An explanation for this discrepancy may be seen in
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa, 3rd Section, Chapter 1. Now six
<div n="lb"/>Manvantaras have passed (See ‘MANVANTARA’).
<div n="lb"/>This is the seventh Manvantara. Each Manvantara
<div n="lb"/>has a new Indra. According to this, different Indras
<div n="lb"/>have their own Airāvatas. This is the only explanation
<div n="lb"/>for this apparent contradiction.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Amṛtam and Garuḍa.%} There is another story about
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtam which says that Garuḍa once went to deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka and brought Amṛtam from there to be given to
<div n="lb"/>the Nāgas, but Devendra came down and took it back.
<div n="lb"/>This story is given in Mahābhārata from Chapter 27
<div n="lb"/>onwards. Vinatā, a wife of Kaśyapa gave birth to
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa and Kadru and her sister gave birth to the
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas. Once there was a dispute between Vinatā and
<div n="lb"/>Kadru. Vinatā said that the hairs on the tail of Uccai-
<div n="lb"/>śravas, Devendra's horse, were white but Kadru
<div n="lb"/>asserted that they were black. To settle the dispute they
<div n="lb"/>made a bet. The condition was that the loser must
<div n="lb"/>become the servant maid of the winner. As instructed
<div n="lb"/>by Kadru, some of the Nāgas went in advance and
<div n="lb"/>hung down from the tail of Uccaiśśravas, thus giving the
<div n="lb"/>false appearance of a tail with black hairs. By this trick
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā lost the bet and had to become Kadru's servant
<div n="lb"/>maid. As a result of it, the task of looking after Kadru's
<div n="lb"/>children became Garuḍa's duty. Kadru told him that
<div n="lb"/>if he fetched Amṛtam from devaloka and gave it to the
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas, she was prepared to release him from the bond-
<div n="lb"/>age. So Garuḍa flew up to devaloka, fought with the
<div n="lb"/>gods and defeated them. He returned with the pot of
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtam and gave it to the Nāgas. The Nāgas went
<div n="lb"/>to take their bath after placing the pot on darbha grass
<div n="lb"/>spread on the floor. Just then Devendra swooped down
<div n="lb"/>and carried away the pot of Amṛtam to devaloka.
<div n="lb"/>When the Nāgas returned after their purifying bath,
<div n="lb"/>the pot was not to be seen. In their greed they began
<div n="lb"/>to lick the darbha grass on which the pot was placed.
<div n="lb"/>The sharp edge of the grass cut their tongues into two.
<div n="lb"/>This is why the Nāgas (snakes) came to have forked
<div n="lb"/>tongues.
<div n="NI"/>Amṛtam which has been thus recovered after many
<div n="lb"/>such adventures, is still preserved carefully in devaloka.
