VIDURA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Vidura was a superhuman
<div n="lb"/>being, very famous in the story of Mahābhārata, as a
<div n="lb"/>brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, as a man of colossal intelligence
<div n="lb"/>who had been closely watching the goings and comings
<div n="lb"/>of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, as the adviser of
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and as a man of immense learning and
<div n="lb"/>wisdom.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Incarnation af Dharmadeva.%} There is a story in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 107, which describes
<div n="lb"/>Vidura as born from a portion of Dharmadeva. The
<div n="lb"/>story is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there was a hermit called Māṇḍavya in India.
<div n="lb"/>As he was standing in deep meditation near his hermit-
<div n="lb"/>age, the men of the King chased some thieves and came
<div n="lb"/>to the place where the hermit stood. The robbers
<div n="lb"/>placed the stolen property near the hermit and ran
<div n="lb"/>away. The king's men caught the hermit, and the
<div n="lb"/>thieves. The King ordered them to be placed on a
<div n="lb"/>trident. The thieves died on the trident. But Māṇḍavya
<div n="lb"/>was not dead. The King sawed the trident and got
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍavya down. The hermit went to Dharmadeva and
<div n="lb"/>asked him what his blame was for suffering the punish-
<div n="lb"/>ment of the trident on him. Dharmadeva replied that
<div n="lb"/>the punishment was inflicted for a cruel deed he had
<div n="lb"/>done in his childhood. He had caught some flies and
<div n="lb"/>made a bunch of them by piercing them with the rib of
<div n="lb"/>a coconut-palm leaf. But Māṇḍavya argued that
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva was not right in punishing him because
<div n="lb"/>the Śāstras and rules of righteousness said that mistakes
<div n="lb"/>committed by boys below the age of twelve could not
<div n="lb"/>be considered to be sins. Further he cursed Dharmadeva
<div n="lb"/>that he would take birth on the earth from the womb
<div n="lb"/>of a Śūdrā. Accordingly Dharmadeva took birth from
<div n="lb"/>the womb of the servant of Ambikā and Ambālikā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} Vidura was born as the brother of Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. (For detailed story see under Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra I, para 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Up to marriage.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura
<div n="lb"/>spent their younger days in Hastināpura as inseparable
<div n="lb"/>brothers. Their teacher was Bhīṣma. Vidura learned
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas, Śāstras, Purāṇas, Itihāsas etc. also, along
<div n="lb"/>with the education given to a prince such as archery,
<div n="lb"/>club-fight, sword-fight, wrestling, controlling elephants
<div n="lb"/>etc. He understood that to be righteous was far better
[Page848-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>than fighting. It is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 108, that Vidura got the sense of righteousness,
<div n="lb"/>and education in fighting, at the same time.
<div n="NI"/>Childhood ended. As Vidura was born to a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>by a Śūdrā woman he had no right to become King.
<div n="lb"/>When he grew up, the duty to find a wife for him fell
<div n="lb"/>on Bhīṣma. At that time a damsel born to a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>by a Śūdrā woman was being brought up in the palace
<div n="lb"/>of King Devaka. With the permission of Devaka, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>brought the girl and gave her in marriage to Vidura.
<div n="lb"/>It is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 114,
<div n="lb"/>that sons and daughters were born to the couple.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Partiality towards the Pāṇḍavas.%} Vidura was the most
<div n="lb"/>intelligent and wisest man of his time, and he always
<div n="lb"/>favoured righteousness. Though he viewed the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>and the Pāṇḍavas with equal favour, in his heart he
<div n="lb"/>felt some partiality towards the Pāṇḍavas, because they
<div n="lb"/>were virtuous, whereas the Kauravas were becoming
<div n="lb"/>more and more wicked. As this partiality arose from
<div n="lb"/>his sense of righteousness, nobody could blame Vidura
<div n="lb"/>for this. His aim was the prosperity of the Lunar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty of Kings.
<div n="NI"/>Many ill omens were seen at the time of the birth
<div n="lb"/>of Duryodhana. Vidura understood that if that infant
<div n="lb"/>grew up he would be a comet to the Lunar dynasty. It
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 115,
<div n="lb"/>that Vidura advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra that it would be better
<div n="lb"/>for him to throw away that infant.
<div n="NI"/>The death of Pāṇḍu drew Vidura closer to the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>Vidura took the lead in performing the funeral rites
<div n="lb"/>and other ceremonies which followed. The Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>were very sad and miserable at the death of their father.
<div n="lb"/>It was at this time that Duryodhana poisoned Bhīma-
<div n="lb"/>sena, tied him with a rope and threw him into the
<div n="lb"/>river Ganges. Bhīmasena was carried to the world of
<div n="lb"/>nāgas (serpents). Kuntī felt grieved at the loss of her
<div n="lb"/>son Bhīma, but Vidura consoled her.
<div n="NI"/>It was due to the wisdom of Vidura that the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>escaped from the disaster in the lac-house. As soon as
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana had completed the lac-house, Vidura
<div n="lb"/>understood the deception lying hidden under it.
<div n="lb"/>and he informed the Pāṇḍavas of everything about it.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover he sent a man named Khanaka and made
<div n="lb"/>an underground passage from the lac-house. When the
<div n="lb"/>lac-house was burnt down, the Pāṇḍavas escaped by
<div n="lb"/>the under-ground passage and reached the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges. Vidura had sent a ferryman secretly to
<div n="lb"/>take them to the other side of the Ganges. When
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma got the news that the Pāṇḍavas had been burnt
<div n="lb"/>to death in the lac-house he became very sad. It is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>149, that Vidura informed Bhīṣma secretly that the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were not dead.
<div n="NI"/>After this event the Pāṇḍavas come into the scene only
<div n="lb"/>at the Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Pāñcālī. Bhīṣma and
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa proposed that the Pāṇḍavas should be brought
<div n="lb"/>back and be given half of the kingdom. Vidura, by his
<div n="lb"/>arugments convinced Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the proposal of
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma and Droṇa was correct. Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
<div n="lb"/>Vidura to bring the Pāṇḍavas back. Vidura went to
<div n="lb"/>the city of Drupada and brought the Pāṇḍavas back
<div n="lb"/>and consoled their mother Kuntī. After this Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>performed Rājasūya (sacrifice of royal consecration).
<div n="lb"/>Vidura took part in it and took the charge of financial
[Page849-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>part of the sacrifice. It was after this that Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>challenged Yudhiṣṭhira for a game of dice. Vidura saw
<div n="lb"/>beforehand that this move on the part of Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>was dangerous. So he talked forcibly against this, and
<div n="lb"/>gave warning to all concerned. As Duryodhana did not
<div n="lb"/>agree with Vidura, he was scolded. But Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>was firm and the game was conducted. Pāñcālī was
<div n="lb"/>harassed by means of stripping and the Pāṇḍavas went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest. It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3, that Vidura had been witnessing all these
<div n="lb"/>scenes with wet eyes.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Separated from the Pāṇḍavas.%} When the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>were driven to the forest, Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt sorry. He
<div n="lb"/>became more afraid of the people than he was sorry
<div n="lb"/>for the Pāṇḍavas. He understood that his subjects
<div n="lb"/>would unite and rise against his sons. He called
<div n="lb"/>Vidura and asked him for a remedy. Vidura who was
<div n="lb"/>full of impatience, made a speech against the wicked-
<div n="lb"/>ness of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and advised him to
<div n="lb"/>forsake his own sons and to bring the Pāṇḍavas back
<div n="lb"/>and give them the kingdom. Dhṛtarāṣṭra did not like
<div n="lb"/>this approach. He said that Vidura was partial to the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and asked him to go away from the palace.
<div n="lb"/>Vidura became grieved at this. He followed the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas, and walking a long distance, reached the
<div n="lb"/>forest Kāmyaka and met the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>When Vidura had gone Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt miserable.
<div n="lb"/>He sent for Vidura and when he returned Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>begged for pardon. Vidura again became the adviser
<div n="lb"/>of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Adviser of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} The advice of Vidura is
<div n="lb"/>famous in Mahābhārata. The main duty of Vidura was
<div n="lb"/>to console Dhṛtarāṣṭra by speaking about righteousness
<div n="lb"/>when he became troubled in mind because of the const-
<div n="lb"/>ant quarrels between his sons and the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>Vidura fulfilled his duty well. Duryodhana was firm on
<div n="lb"/>the point that not a dot of land would be given to the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to Hastināpura as mediator.
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana showed disrespect to him. Vidura said
<div n="lb"/>in strong words that it was wrong on the part of
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana to have done so and compelled Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra to show due respect and hospitality to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Dhṛtarāṣṭra welcomed Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>showed respect and hospitality. Knowing this, Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana and his brothers tried to make Śrī Kṛṣṇa a
<div n="lb"/>captive. Vidura harshly scolded them for this attempt.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing all these impudent actions on the part of his
<div n="lb"/>sons, Dhṛtarāṣṭra became distressed. Vidura consoled
<div n="lb"/>him by good exhortations. He told Dhṛtarāṣṭra about
<div n="lb"/>the transience of life and the importance of the soul.
<div n="lb"/>When the battle was fiercely going on in the battle-
<div n="lb"/>ground of Kurukṣetra, Vidura remained with Dhrta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra consoling him and giving him good advice. The
<div n="lb"/>death of Bhīṣma was an unbearable grief to Vidura. He
<div n="lb"/>took part in the funeral of Bhīṣma. He himself placed
<div n="lb"/>the body on the funeral pyre. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 168, Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Pilgrimage.%} When Vidura failed in his attempt to
<div n="lb"/>ward off a pitched battle between the Kauravas and
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas he felt extremely miserable. Without
<div n="lb"/>taking part in the battle, he started on a pilgrimage.
<div n="lb"/>Getting the news at Prabhāsaksetra about the end of
<div n="lb"/>the battle, he went to the basin of river Yamunā. On
<div n="lb"/>the way he heard the news of the passing away of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, from Uddhava. Before death Śrī Kṛṣṇa had
[Page849-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>revealed that Vidura had heard Uddhavagītā from
<div n="lb"/>Maitreya. This book which is in the form of a conver-
<div n="lb"/>sation between Vidura and Maitreya contains the talk
<div n="lb"/>between Kapila and Devahūti. Description of the line
<div n="lb"/>of Manus, sacrifice of Dakṣa, story of Dhruva, story
<div n="lb"/>of Pṛthu, story of Purañjana etc. were the subjects of the
<div n="lb"/>talk. (Bhāgavata, 3—4).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%End.%} The Bhārata-battle came to an end. The
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas were exterminated. Efforts were begun to
<div n="lb"/>establish law and order. In all these efforts Vidura was
<div n="lb"/>a help to the Pāṇḍavas. Still he spent most of his time
<div n="lb"/>with the old Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Yudhiṣṭhira came to Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra and both embraced each other. Seeing this
<div n="lb"/>Vidura cried aloud. Vidura advised Yudhiṣṭhira how
<div n="lb"/>to carry on the administration of the new government.
<div n="lb"/>After this he decided to go to the forest to spend his
<div n="lb"/>last days. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī, Kuntī, Vidura and
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni went to the forest. The Pāṇḍavas tried in vain
<div n="lb"/>to prevent them from going. When Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī, Kuntī, Vidura, Sañjaya and others started
<div n="lb"/>for the forest, even Bhīmasena cried aloud. Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the people of the city went along with them up to
<div n="lb"/>the river Ganges. On the bank of the Ganges near the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Śatayūpa, a hermitage was erected and
<div n="lb"/>Vidura and the others lived there.
<div n="NI"/>They lived there for nearly six years. The Pāṇḍavas be-
<div n="lb"/>came unable to bear the separation from their elders.
<div n="lb"/>Once Dharmaputra dreamt about his mother. Next day
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas went to the banks of the Ganges. Pāñcālī,
<div n="lb"/>Subhadrā, Uttarā and many people of the city followed
<div n="lb"/>them. They went to the Śatayūpa-hermitage and saw
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the others. But the great Vidura was
<div n="lb"/>not there. When asked about it he got the reply that
<div n="lb"/>having become abstemious and having no more desires
<div n="lb"/>he was wandering about. Yudhiṣṭhira was greatly
<div n="lb"/>troubled.
<div n="NI"/>Next day at dawn when Yudhiṣṭhira went to bathe in
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges, on the way he saw Vidura sitting in contem-
<div n="lb"/>plation with a stone in his mouth. Yudhiṣṭhira stood
<div n="lb"/>with joined palms before the lean and weak form of
<div n="lb"/>that sage and said “Look, Dharmaputra bows before
<div n="lb"/>you.” He repeated this several times. But there was
<div n="lb"/>no change in Vidura. Yudhiṣṭhira's disappointment
<div n="lb"/>did not last long. For, in a short while Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>saw that a divine radiance emanated from the body
<div n="lb"/>of Vidura and passed on to his body and that the body
<div n="lb"/>of Vidura fell lifeless on the ground. This union took
<div n="lb"/>place because both Vidura and Yudhiṣṭhira were port-
<div n="lb"/>ions of Dharmadeva. After this Dharmaputra made
<div n="lb"/>preparations to burn the body of Vidura. Then an ethe-
<div n="lb"/>real voice said “Vidura is abstemious. His body should
<div n="lb"/>not be burned.” Dharmaputra went to the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>and informed all, about the death of Vidura. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapters 26 to 28).
<div n="NI"/>Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Svargārohaṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Stanza 22, that Vidura entered Svarga
<div n="lb"/>(heaven) and stays there in the form of Dharmadeva.
