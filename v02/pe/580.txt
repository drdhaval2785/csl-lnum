AŚVASENA¦. A serpent which lived in the forest of
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍava. This was the son of Takṣaka and he tried
<div n="lb"/>his best to escape from the fire that burnt the forest.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 5, Chapter 239, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Once when Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa were sitting on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the river Yamunā, Agni approached them and request-
<div n="lb"/>ed them to help him burn the forest of Khāṇḍava (see
<div n="lb"/>under Khāṇḍavadāha). They agreed to help him and
<div n="lb"/>Agni started burning the forest. Indra poured rains over
<div n="lb"/>the fire; Arjuna created a canopy of arrows and prevent-
<div n="lb"/>ed the rains from falling down. Aśvasena, son of
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka tried to escape from the fire but Arjuna obs-
<div n="lb"/>tructed his way by arrows. Then Aśvasena's mother
<div n="lb"/>swallowed him and kept him in her stomach. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>cut off her head. Seeing this Indra sent a cyclone to
<div n="lb"/>smash the canopy of arrows and Arjuna fell fainting.
<div n="lb"/>Taking the opportunity Aśvasena escaped. When Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>woke up from his unconscious state he found Aśvasena
<div n="lb"/>missing. Then Arjuna cursed him thus: “Let not you
<div n="lb"/>get refuge anywhere.” (Chapter 226, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="lb"/>Aśvasena kept his grudge against Arjuna till the end.
<div n="lb"/>In the great battle Arjuna and Karṇa met for a fight
<div n="lb"/>and when Karṇa sent his Nāgāstra (serpent missile)
<div n="lb"/>against Arjuna, Aśvasena hid himself in that missile
<div n="lb"/>and burnt the beautiful headwear of Arjuna. But Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>did not like this foul play and refused to accept him
<div n="lb"/>when he came back. Enraged at this the serpent attacked
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna directly and was killed. Before his death he got
<div n="lb"/>acquainted with Kṛṣṇa. (Chapter 96, Karṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
