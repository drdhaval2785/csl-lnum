JAMBUKEŚVARA¦. Name of an idol of Śiva (Liṅga)
<div n="lb"/>installed in Mysore. The Śivaliṅga installed in the Jam-
<div n="lb"/>bukeśvara temple in Mysore. Jambū is a fruit tree.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story about how Śiva happened to come
<div n="lb"/>under this tree.
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time this place was full of Jambū trees,
<div n="lb"/>and a recluse performing a penance under a Jambū
<div n="lb"/>tree got a fruit of it. Attracted, so to say, by the sanctity
<div n="lb"/>of the fruit the recluse submitted it first as an offering
[Page343-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>to Lord Śiva, and only after that he ate it. As a result of
<div n="lb"/>that the fruit germinated in the stomach of the sage
<div n="lb"/>grew up into a tree and emerged into light and air
<div n="lb"/>bursting his head open. Elated at this the sage danced
<div n="lb"/>before God, who asked him to return to the place from
<div n="lb"/>where he got the fruit. Accordingly he returned to
<div n="lb"/>Tiruvānakovil and continued his penance. Pleased so
<div n="lb"/>much with the Sage Śiva followed him and sat under
<div n="lb"/>the tree. From that day onwards Śiva came to be
<div n="lb"/>called Jambunātha. To this day Jambunātha sits under
<div n="lb"/>the Jambū tree.
<div n="NI"/>Later, a temple came to be built there under the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing circumstances. A controversy arose between Māl-
<div n="lb"/>yavān and Puṣpadanta, two of the Bhūtagaṇas of Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>as to who cherished more devotion to the Lord. The
<div n="lb"/>controversy developed into a quarrel and Puṣpadanta
<div n="lb"/>cursed Mālyavān into a spider, and Mālyavān cursed
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta into an elephant. Now, when the mutual
<div n="lb"/>curse took effect wisdom dawned on both Mālyavān and
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta, and they took refuge in the Lord for re-
<div n="lb"/>demption from the curse. The Lord sent both of them to
<div n="lb"/>the Cola country, and after wandering about in differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent parts of the country both of them came to Jambu-
<div n="lb"/>keśvara, and lived there worshipping God. The elephant
<div n="lb"/>used to bathe daily in sacred tīrthas, bring holy water
<div n="lb"/>in its trunk and make an offering of it to the Lord. As
<div n="lb"/>for the spider it wove a net above the head of the Lord.
<div n="lb"/>so that dried leaves did not fall on it. The elephant
<div n="lb"/>used to daily sweep off the net above the head of the
<div n="lb"/>Lord and make his offering of the water thereon. But,
<div n="lb"/>the spider would again weave the net. Thus their quar-
<div n="lb"/>rel continued. One day the spider, in great anger, got
<div n="lb"/>into the trunk of the elephant and bit it hard. Due to
<div n="lb"/>unbearable pain it smashed its trunk on a granite stone
<div n="lb"/>and fell down dead. At this God appeared and blessed
<div n="lb"/>both of them. The Lord also said that the sacred spot
<div n="lb"/>would come to be known as Tiruvāna-Kovil (āna=
<div n="lb"/>elephant; Kovil = temple) in memory of Puṣpadanta
<div n="lb"/>who had taken the form of the elephant. The spider
<div n="lb"/>was told that he would be born in the Cola dynasty
<div n="lb"/>and carry on for long years many good acts. Accor-
<div n="lb"/>dingly Mālyavān was born as the son of Śubhadeva, the
<div n="lb"/>Cola king and Kamalāvatī, his queen, and ruled the
<div n="lb"/>land for many years under the name King Ceṅkaṇṇa.
<div n="lb"/>He it was who built the Jambukeśvara temple. (Tiru-
<div n="lb"/>vānakkāvu Purāṇa).
