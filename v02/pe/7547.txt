TIRUJÑĀNASAMBANDHA¦ (R). He was one of the
<div n="lb"/>four Dākṣiṇātya Śaivamatācāryas. He lived during the
<div n="lb"/>early part of the seventh century. The book on Dākṣi-
<div n="lb"/>ṇātya Śaivamata is called Tirumura. There are twelve
<div n="lb"/>songs in that book. They were compiled by Nambi-
<div n="lb"/>yāṇḍār Nambi who lived during the period of Rājarāja
<div n="lb"/>Cola. The first seven of these are devotional songs
<div n="lb"/>called Tevāras. They were composed jointly by Tiru-
<div n="lb"/>jñānasambandhar, Tirunāvukkaraśar and Sundaramūrti.
<div n="lb"/>The first three tevāras are of Tirujñānasambandhar.
<div n="lb"/>The twelfth tirumura is called Periyapurāṇa. Its author
<div n="lb"/>was Śekkizhār. He was called Arulmozhitteva also. He
<div n="lb"/>was the chief minister of Anapāyacola who ruled during
<div n="lb"/>the period 1063 to 1112 A.D. The theme of Periya-
<div n="lb"/>purāṇa is the life history of sixty-three Śaivasiddhas who
<div n="lb"/>were renowned as Nāyanārs and Aṭiyārs. It is in the
<div n="lb"/>sixth chapter of the second part of this book that they
<div n="lb"/>discuss Tirujñānasambandhar.
<div n="NI"/>He was born in the village of Śīrkāzhi (Brahmapura)
<div n="lb"/>near Kumbhakoṇam in the district of Tañjāvūr. His
<div n="lb"/>father was Śivapādarāya and mother Bhagavatiyār.
<div n="lb"/>Once when Śivapādarāya went to bathe in the temple
<div n="lb"/>tank called Brahmatīrtha he took along with him his
<div n="lb"/>son Sambandhar also. Keeping his son on the steps of
<div n="lb"/>the tank Śivapādarāya plunged himself into the waters.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Pārvatī who came that way saw the child
<div n="lb"/>sitting alone and Pārvatī went and fed him with her
<div n="lb"/>breast-milk. From that moment onwards the child
<div n="lb"/>started singing songs in praise of Śiva and Pārvatī.
<div n="lb"/>When he grew up, he did many wonderful deeds visiting
<div n="lb"/>many Śiva temples of Pāṇḍirājya. His father fixed up
<div n="lb"/>a marriage for him and the bride's party assembled
<div n="lb"/>even before time at the Cidambara temple. Tirujñā-
<div n="lb"/>nasambandhar came there in time and standing before
<div n="lb"/>the temple deity sang a song in praise of Śiva. The song
<div n="lb"/>was greatly appealing and at the end of the song before
<div n="lb"/>all those assembled there Sambandhar to the astonish-
<div n="lb"/>ment of all merged with the deity.
