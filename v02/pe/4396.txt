MARĪCI I¦. A Maharṣi (sage) born from Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>mind.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and Genealogy.%} The six great sages born from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's mind were:—Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya,
<div n="lb"/>Pulaha and Kratu, according to Mahābhārata, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Domestic life.%} Marīci had several wives and children.
<div n="lb"/>He married Kalā, the daughter of Kardama Prajāpati
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Devahūti. Marīci had two sons Kaśyapa
[Page487-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and Pūrṇiman by Kalā. This Kaśyapa was the original
<div n="lb"/>ancestor of all living beings. But Pūrṇiman's family did
<div n="lb"/>not become well-known. Pūrṇiman had two sons, Virajas
<div n="lb"/>and Viśvaga and a daughter Devakulyā. Devakulyā
<div n="lb"/>washed the feet of Mahāviṣṇu and merged with Ākāśa
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>Ūrṇā was another wife of Marīci. Six sons were born
<div n="lb"/>to Ūrṇā. Under a curse of Brahmā they were born first
<div n="lb"/>as the sons of Hiraṇyakaśipu and in their next birth
<div n="lb"/>as the sons of Vasudeva and Devakī. It was these six
<div n="lb"/>children who were born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa's elder brothers
<div n="lb"/>whom Kaṃsa killed immediately after their birth.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Marīci had another wife named Sambhūti. She gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to Paurṇamāsa. In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>10, we see that Paurṇamāsa who was a Mahātmā had
<div n="lb"/>two sons Virajas and Parvata. Dharmavratā was yet
<div n="lb"/>another wife of Marīci. She was a daughter born to
<div n="lb"/>Dharmavatī by Dharmadeva.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Dharmavratā cursed.%} Marīci lived happily for long
<div n="lb"/>with his wife Dharmavratā. Once he returned from
<div n="lb"/>the forest, carrying darbha grass, flowers etc.
<div n="lb"/>He was tired after a long walk. After taking food, he
<div n="lb"/>wanted his wife to massage his legs. While she was
<div n="lb"/>massaging him Marīci fell asleep. Just then Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>happened to come there. Dharmavratā was in a fix.
<div n="lb"/>She had to attend to her husband and at the same time
<div n="lb"/>receive Brahmā with due respect. She could not leave
<div n="lb"/>her husband's guru (Sire). It was her duty to honour
<div n="lb"/>him properly.
<div n="NI"/>At last she got up and welcomed Brahmā, offering
<div n="lb"/>him the customary honours. Meanwhile Marīci woke
<div n="lb"/>up and not finding his wife near him cursed her to be
<div n="lb"/>turned into a stone. Dharmavratā who was distressed
<div n="lb"/>at the curse pleaded innocence and explained to him
<div n="lb"/>that she had been honouring his guru. She warned him
<div n="lb"/>that he would incur the curse of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Under Marīci's curse Dharmavratā was separated from
<div n="lb"/>him. She performed penance in the midst of fires. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu appeared before her and asked her what boon
<div n="lb"/>she wanted. She prayed that her curse might be lifted.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu replied:—“It was Marīci who cursed you. That
<div n="lb"/>curse cannot be withdrawn. You will be turned into a
<div n="lb"/>sacred stone. Your name “Dharmavratā” will be
<div n="lb"/>changed into “Devavratā”. In future, that stone will
<div n="lb"/>become famous under the name “Devavratā” or “Deva-
<div n="lb"/>śilā”. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara and goddesses like
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī will dwell in that stone.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this, Mahāviṣṇu disappeared. Once
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva held this Devaśilā above the demon Gaya
<div n="lb"/>and the place became famous under the name of “Gayā
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha”. (See under Gayātīrtha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
