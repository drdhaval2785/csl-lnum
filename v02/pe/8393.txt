VIPULA III¦. A hermit who was born in the dynasty of
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu. There is a story showing how this hermit protect-
<div n="lb"/>ed the wife of his teacher from Indra while he was the
<div n="lb"/>disciple of the hermit Devaśarmā, in Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 40. The story is given below:
<div n="lb"/>Ruci, the wife of the hermit Devaśarmā, was extremely
<div n="lb"/>beautiful. Devaśarmā was aware of the fact that Indra
<div n="lb"/>had often looked at his wife with covetous eyes. He had
<div n="lb"/>to perform a sacrifice. But he feared that if he went
<div n="lb"/>away from the hermitage his wife would be carried away
<div n="lb"/>by Indra. At last he called his beloved disciple Vipula
<div n="lb"/>and revealed the secret to him. The teacher told his dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciple that Indra was a libertine as well as a magician
<div n="lb"/>and that he would appear in various forms to entice
<div n="lb"/>Ruci, and asked him to protect Ruci even at the cost
<div n="lb"/>of his life. Then Devaśarmā left the hermitage for the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>Vipula followed the wife of his teacher, wherever she
<div n="lb"/>went. He feared that Indra might come even unseen by
<div n="lb"/>anybody. So he decided to get inside Ruci by super-
<div n="lb"/>natural powers of Yoga. He made Ruci to sit in front of
<div n="lb"/>him and stare into his eyes and through the rays of her
<div n="lb"/>eyes he entered inside her.
<div n="NI"/>Knowing that Devaśarmā had left the hermitage, Indra
[Page858-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>came in front of Ruci. By the power of Stambhana
<div n="lb"/>(suppressing the use of faculties by mantra) Vipula
<div n="lb"/>made Ruci stand motionless staring into the face of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. She did not give any reply to the questions of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. At last Indra looked into Ruci with inward eyes
<div n="lb"/>and saw as in a mirror Vipula sitting inside her. With
<div n="lb"/>shame Indra left the place instantly.
<div n="NI"/>When the teacher returned on completion of the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice Vipula told him all that had taken place. The
<div n="lb"/>teacher was pleased and told his disciple that he might
<div n="lb"/>ask for any boon.
<div n="NI"/>He got the boon to be a righteous man throughout his
<div n="lb"/>life and left the hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>It was during this period that the marriage of Prabhā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, the sister of Ruci, took place. The marriage of
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāvatī with Citraratha, the king of Aṅga, was settled.
<div n="lb"/>A messenger from Aṅga informed Ruci about it. Then
<div n="lb"/>some flowers fell from the sky near Ruci. She wore
<div n="lb"/>them and went to the marriage. Prabhāvatī wanted to
<div n="lb"/>have the same flowers. Vipula was sent to bring flowers
<div n="lb"/>of the same kind. As Vipula was returning with the
<div n="lb"/>flowers, he saw two men turning a wheel. Each of them
<div n="lb"/>claimed that he had turned more than the other, and
<div n="lb"/>quarrelled with each other. One of them pointing at
<div n="lb"/>Vipula, said that he who told lies would get what Vipula
<div n="lb"/>would undergo in hell. Vipula was worried at hearing
<div n="lb"/>this. He proceeded on his journey. He saw six men gamb-
<div n="lb"/>ling. One of them pointed at Vipula and said “A false
<div n="lb"/>gamester would get what Vipula would get in hell.”
<div n="lb"/>Being flurried by these two talks, Vipula ran to his
<div n="lb"/>teacher to understand its meaning. He went to Campā-
<div n="lb"/>purī and saw the teacher and asked him the meaning of
<div n="lb"/>what he had heard. The teacher told him, that the two
<div n="lb"/>who turned the wheel were day and night and the six
<div n="lb"/>who were engaged in gambling were the six Ṛtus (sea-
<div n="lb"/>sons) and that Ṛtus and day and night are witnesses of
<div n="lb"/>every sinful act committed any time. Vipula became
<div n="lb"/>aware of his sin. While he was staying inside the wife of
<div n="lb"/>his teacher, his genital touched her genital and face
<div n="lb"/>touched face. He had not told the teacher this. But the
<div n="lb"/>teacher said that it need not be considered a sin be-
<div n="lb"/>cause the deed was done with no bad intention.
