MAITRĀVARUṆA¦. Another name for Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya also is known by this name. Because they were
<div n="lb"/>born as the sons of Mitra and Varuṇa they got this
<div n="lb"/>name. How they came to be reborn as the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Mitrāvaruṇas is told in Devī Bhāgavata.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a celebrated emperor named Nimi in
<div n="lb"/>the Ikṣvāku line of Kings. Nimi was the twelfth son
<div n="lb"/>of Ikṣvāku. The agrahāra found near the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Gautama Maharṣi, called Jayantapura was constructed
<div n="lb"/>by Nimi. Once Nimi decided to perform a big yāga
<div n="lb"/>and after taking the consent of his father made pre-
<div n="lb"/>parations for the same. He invited such great sages
<div n="lb"/>as Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras, Vāmadeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka. He then went to their family preceptor Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to be the chief priest. But Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>had already promised Indra to conduct a yāga for him
<div n="lb"/>and so advised Nimi to postpone his yāga to a later
<div n="lb"/>date. But Nimi was unwilling to postpone his yāga and
<div n="lb"/>so he performed it with Gautama Maharṣi as the
<div n="lb"/>chief priest. It took five hundred years for Nimi to
<div n="lb"/>complete the yāga. After five hundred years Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>after completing the yāga of Indra came to see Nimi
<div n="lb"/>and found that he had already conducted the yāga
<div n="lb"/>without him. Vasiṣṭha was angry and he cursed Nimi
<div n="lb"/>saying that Nimi would become bodiless. But powerful
<div n="lb"/>Nimi cursed Vasiṣṭha also and separated his soul from
<div n="lb"/>his body.
<div n="NI"/>Griefstricken, Vasiṣṭha went to Brahmā and com-
<div n="lb"/>plained to him. Brahmā said, “Oh son, you go and
<div n="lb"/>merge with the brilliance of Mitrāvaruṇas and stay
<div n="lb"/>there. After some time you will be able to be born
<div n="lb"/>without being in a womb; you will then have a memory
<div n="lb"/>of the past and you will be very learned and will be
<div n="lb"/>worshipped by all”.
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha was pleased to hear that and he circumam-
<div n="lb"/>bulated Brahmā and prostrated before him and then
<div n="lb"/>went to the āśrama of Mitrāvaruṇas. He then
<div n="lb"/>abandoned his body there and merged with the
<div n="lb"/>brilliance of Mitrāvaruṇas. One day Urvaśī with
<div n="lb"/>her companions came to the āśrama of Mitrāvaruṇas
<div n="lb"/>and attracted by her charm they spent a night with
<div n="lb"/>her. Their semen at one time fell into a jar nearby
<div n="lb"/>and from it were born two people, Agastya and
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, (Skandha 6, Devī Bhāgavata).
