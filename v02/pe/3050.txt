KAHOḌA¦ (KAHOḌAKA—KHAGODAKA). A sage
<div n="lb"/>the disciple and son-in-law of Uddālaka. He was
<div n="lb"/>the father of the sage Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="NI"/>Uddālaka had another name “Śvetaketu”. He was a
<div n="lb"/>sage who had personally seen and talked to the goddess
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī. It was at that time that Kahoḍaka became
<div n="lb"/>his disciple. Kahoḍaka who was of a gentle nature
<div n="lb"/>served his preceptor for a long time and won his favour.
<div n="lb"/>He was immensely pleased and after teaching the
<div n="lb"/>necessary things gave his daughter Sujātā in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to Kahoḍaka. In due course, Sujātā became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>One day, the child in the womb cried out that there
<div n="lb"/>was a mistake in his father's recitation of the Vedas.
<div n="lb"/>Kahoḍaka was displeased at this. He cursed the child
<div n="lb"/>that he would be born with a body having eight bends
<div n="lb"/>(curves). So the boy was named “Aṣṭāvakra” (one
<div n="lb"/>who has eight bends). Sujātā who was poor, once sent
<div n="lb"/>Kahoḍaka to King Janaka for some money. Kahoḍaka
<div n="lb"/>who was defeated in a disputation was immersed in
<div n="lb"/>water. Aṣṭāvakra rescued his father. (See under Aṣṭā-
<div n="lb"/>vakra).
