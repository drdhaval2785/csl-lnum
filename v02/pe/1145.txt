<div n="lb"/>reference to his past life.
<div n="NI"/>On the death of Śrutadhara, king of Ekalavyanagara the
<div n="lb"/>younger of his two sons, Satyadhara drove out of the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom the elder brother, Śiladhara. Thus ousted from
<div n="lb"/>his kingdom Śīladhara did due penance and got from
<div n="lb"/>Śiva the boon that Satyadhara be killed while he him-
<div n="lb"/>self be made a gandharva. Owing to the blessing of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva Satyadhara died, and he was born again as Samara-
<div n="lb"/>bhaṭa, son of Ugrabhaṭa, King of Rādhānagara, and
<div n="lb"/>Śīladhara was born as Bhīmabhaṭa, brother of Samara-
<div n="lb"/>bhaṭa. On the death of Ugrabhaṭa Bhīmabhaṭa, after
<div n="lb"/>killing Samarabhaṭa ascended the throne. And, on one of
<div n="lb"/>those days, he was transformed into a wild elephant as
<div n="lb"/>the result of the curse of a muni. But, he remembered
<div n="lb"/>his previous existence, and, though turned into elephant
<div n="lb"/>could speak like men. Bhīmabhaṭa became a gandharva
<div n="lb"/>because he received and treated well once a traveller
<div n="lb"/>and related to him his (Bhīmabhaṭa's) own story.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara Śaśāṃkavatīlaṃbaka).
