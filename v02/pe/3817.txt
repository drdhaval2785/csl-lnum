KUMBHĪPĀKA¦ (M). One of the twentyeight narakas
<div n="lb"/>(hells). It is intended for the cruel folk, who kill for
<div n="lb"/>food harmless animals and birds. Since such cruel folk
<div n="lb"/>are roasted in Kumbhī fire the hell came to be known
<div n="lb"/>by this name. Big vessels full of boiling oil are kept
<div n="lb"/>there and the servants of Yama push the sinners into
<div n="lb"/>them. One who had killed an animal will be kept in
<div n="lb"/>the boiling oil for as many years as the number of hairs
<div n="lb"/>the animal killed by him had on its body. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha; also see under Pitṛtīrtha).
