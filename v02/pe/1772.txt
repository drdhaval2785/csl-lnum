<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Daśaratha was the son of Aja, of the family
<div n="lb"/>of Ikṣvāku, born of his wife Indumatī.
<F>1) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 274, Stanza 6 that ‘Ilabilā, was the name of the mother of Daśaratha.</F>
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Daśaratha's hunt.%} Once during the early part of his
<div n="lb"/>life Daśaratha was walking through a forest engaged in
<div n="lb"/>hunting. He reached the bank of the river Sarayū.
<div n="lb"/>It was evening and the forest was thick. He walked in
<div n="lb"/>search of wild animals. The night was advancing and
<div n="lb"/>darkness getting thicker. Then he heard a sound from
<div n="lb"/>the river as if an elephant was drinking water. Thinking
<div n="lb"/>it to be an elephant Daśaratha sent an arrow in the
<div n="lb"/>direction from which the sound came. Instantly he heard
<div n="lb"/>a man crying with pain. The king was disappointed.
<div n="lb"/>He ran to the spot and saw a hermit boy lying in a pool
<div n="lb"/>of blood beating his limbs on the ground and crying.
<div n="lb"/>The waterpot he had been dipping in the water lay
<div n="lb"/>close by. In answer to the questions of the King, the
[Page204-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>hermit boy whose name was Śravaṇa,
<F>1. In Agnipurāṇa Chapter 6, it is stated that the name of this hermit boy was Yajñadatta.</F> said, “Oh
<div n="lb"/>King! What wrong have I done? My parents are
<div n="lb"/>sitting thirsty and blind with age, in the hermitage close-
<div n="lb"/>by. I, their only son, was dipping the pot to take water
<div n="lb"/>to them, when you sent the arrow at me. So, please take
<div n="lb"/>some water to them in this pot and console them.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this, with tears the King drew out the fatal
<div n="lb"/>arrow from the body of the boy and with that the boy
<div n="lb"/>Śravaṇa said good bye to the world. Daśaratha took
<div n="lb"/>water in the pot and went in search of the hermitage in
<div n="lb"/>the darkness. With difficulty he found out the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>and as he drew near, the aged parents of the boy heard
<div n="lb"/>his footsteps and called him eagerly. The King, with
<div n="lb"/>tearful eyes told them what had happened. There was
<div n="lb"/>loud wailing and crying in the hermitage. According to
<div n="lb"/>their wish the King took them to where their son lay.
<div n="lb"/>Then the King made a fire and placed the dead body
<div n="lb"/>of the boy in it. The aged and blind parents cursed
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha, “You also will die of loss of children”.
<div n="lb"/>Then they also entered the fire and were burnt along
<div n="lb"/>with their son's dead body. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayo-
<div n="lb"/>dhyā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 63).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage.%} Daśaratha had three wives, named
<div n="lb"/>Kauśalyā, Kaikeyī and Sumitrā.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaikeyī given a boon.%} There was a great battle in the
<div n="lb"/>world of the gods between the asuras and the gods.
<div n="lb"/>According to the request of the devas, Daśaratha went to
<div n="lb"/>the world of the devas to help them. Kaikeyī also went
<div n="lb"/>with Daśaratha. In a severe fight with Śambara, an
<div n="lb"/>asura, Daśaratha fell down unconscious. Kaikeyī took
<div n="lb"/>him away from the battle-field. When he recovered the
<div n="lb"/>King got into the chariot and fought more fiercely than
<div n="lb"/>before. This time the wheel-bolt of one of the wheels of
<div n="lb"/>the chariot of Daśaratha slipped away. Without inform-
<div n="lb"/>ing her husband of this danger, Kaikeyī inserted her
<div n="lb"/>finger into the bolt-hole and prevented the wheel from
<div n="lb"/>sliding away. The King won the battle. After the battle,
<div n="lb"/>when the King came to know of the services rendered
<div n="lb"/>by Kaikeyī, he promised her two boons. Kaikeyī told
<div n="lb"/>the King that she would ask for them later, when she
<div n="lb"/>needed them. Then they returned to Ayodhyā. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Sarga 9, Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Administration of Daśaratha.%} The capital of Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>ratha's kingdom of Kosala, was Ayodhyā. This city was
<div n="lb"/>situated on the bank of river Sarayū. Daśaratha was as
<div n="lb"/>famous in Ayodhyā as Indra was in the realm of the
<div n="lb"/>gods. There were palaces in Ayodhyā for the kings who
<div n="lb"/>brought tribute to stay. In short, as mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 5, Ayodhyā was
<div n="lb"/>the heaven on earth.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Ministers.%} Daśaratha had eight ministers, Sṛṣṭi,
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhārtha, Rāṣṭravardhana, Aśoka,
<div n="lb"/>Dharmapāla, and Sumantra. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The name Daśaratha.%} The real name of Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>was Nemi. Once the unattackable and invincible asura
<div n="lb"/>Śaṃbara conquered the throne of Indra. At the request
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā and the gods, this King reached heaven and
<div n="lb"/>destroyed the armies of the asuras very easily. Śaṃbara
<div n="lb"/>got angry, assumed ten shapes and attacked the King
<div n="lb"/>from ten points at the same time. The king confronted
<div n="lb"/>the ten Śaṃbaras at ten points, at the same time, and
<div n="lb"/>killed all of them at the same moment. Because he
<div n="lb"/>faced his chariot to ten points at the same time and
<div n="lb"/>fought with enemies on those ten points Brahmā appre-
[Page204-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>ciated his valiant fighting and charioteering and gave
<div n="lb"/>him the name ‘Daśaratha’ (one who is capable of driving
<div n="lb"/>the chariot to ten points at the same time). Thus his
<div n="lb"/>original name was forgotten and he came to be known
<div n="lb"/>only by the name given him later. (Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Birth of Sons.%} Kausalyā was the first wife of Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>ratha. She was the daughter of the King of Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Kosala. A daughter named Śāntā was born to Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>by Kausalyā. After this, no sons or daughters were born
<div n="lb"/>to Daśaratha for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>At this juncture Lomapāda, the king of Aṅga who was the
<div n="lb"/>class-mate and a great friend of Daśaratha, came to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā on a friendly visit. He also had no children.
<div n="lb"/>So he entreated Daśaratha to give Śāntā to him as a
<div n="lb"/>foster-daughter. Thus he took away Śāntā to Aṅga.
<div n="lb"/>Lomapāda gave Śāntā in marriage to Ṛṣyaṣṛṅga a
<div n="lb"/>hermit. (See under Ṛṣyaśṛṅga).
<div n="NI"/>As Kausalyā was childless Daśaratha brought as his
<div n="lb"/>wife Kaikeyī the daughter of the King of Kekaya and
<div n="lb"/>sister of Yudhājit. Still no children were born to them.
<div n="lb"/>He was much disappointed. At last he married again and
<div n="lb"/>brought Sumitrā the princess of Kāśi. Of these three,
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā was the chief wife.
<div n="NI"/>Though he had three wives, Daśaratha still remained
<div n="lb"/>childless. The King and his queens spent their days in
<div n="lb"/>sorrow for a long time. The King remembered the curse
<div n="lb"/>he had incurred when he was young. The curse was
<div n="lb"/>that as they had died with sorrow at the death of their
<div n="lb"/>son Śravaṇa, the same thing would happen to me.
<div n="lb"/>So he believed that sons would be born to him.
<div n="NI"/>He performed several devotional acts to get children.
<div n="lb"/>Finally he gave up all kingly pleasures and began to
<div n="lb"/>lead an ascetic life. He built a temple for his own use
<div n="lb"/>and consecrated the idol of Mahāviṣṇu in it. Then entrust-
<div n="lb"/>ing the administration of the Kingdom to his ministers
<div n="lb"/>he and his wives engaged themselves in daily devotion
<div n="lb"/>and meditation in the temple. Then the King decided
<div n="lb"/>to perform the sacrifice of Putrakāmeṣṭi (sacrifice for
<div n="lb"/>getting children) by the hermit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga under the
<div n="lb"/>guidance of Vasiṣṭha. The King informed Ṛṣyaśṛṅga
<div n="lb"/>of his decision. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga could not refuse the King's
<div n="lb"/>request as the king was his father-in-law. Moreover
<div n="lb"/>Lomapāda and Śāntā also requested the hermit to com-
<div n="lb"/>ply with the desire of Daśaratha. So Ṛṣyaśṛṅga came to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā and the sacrifice of Putrakāmeṣṭi was begun.
<div n="lb"/>The air vibrated with the recitation of mantras (spells and
<div n="lb"/>incantations) and the Veda Sūktas. The hermit uttered
<div n="lb"/>the divine spell of Putrakāmeṣṭi and offered oblations
<div n="lb"/>in the sacrificial fire. Then a wonderful and luminous
<div n="lb"/>figure came out of the fire with a pot containing a
<div n="lb"/>pudding of ambrosia, and placed the pot before Ṛṣya-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṛṅga and then disappeared in the sacrificial fire. When
<div n="lb"/>the wonderful figure disappeared, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga took the
<div n="lb"/>pot of pudding and gave it to Daśaratha with prayer and
<div n="lb"/>incantations. Daśaratha received the golden pot and in
<div n="lb"/>accordance with the instruction of the hermit, divided
<div n="lb"/>the pudding between his first wife Kauśalyā and second
<div n="lb"/>wife Kaikeyī, both of whom gave half of their share to
<div n="lb"/>Sumitrā. Thus the three wives ate the divine pudding
<div n="lb"/>and by and by all of them became pregnant. Kauśalyā
<div n="lb"/>and Kaikeyī gave birth to a son each and Sumitrā
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to two sons. The son of Kauśalyā was called
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, the son of Kaikeyī was named Bharata and the
[Page205-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sons of Sumitrā were called Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna.
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The boon of Śani (Saturn).%} Astronomers are of
<div n="lb"/>opinion that famine will occur in the world for the
<div n="lb"/>period of twelve years, when the planet Śani (Saturn)
<div n="lb"/>comes into the orbit of Rohiṇī (a star). But now the
<div n="lb"/>planet Saturn does not come into the orbit of the star
<div n="lb"/>Rohiṇī. There is a story in the Padma Purāṇa, which
<div n="lb"/>states that this happened so because of a boon Śani had
<div n="lb"/>given to Daśaratha.
<div n="NI"/>During the regime of Daśaratha the planet Śani approa-
<div n="lb"/>ched the orbit of Rohiṇī. Experts in astronomy said that
<div n="lb"/>the earth would be ruined by famine etc. if Śani cleft
<div n="lb"/>the star Rohiṇī. Hearing this Daśaratha took his bow
<div n="lb"/>and arrows, got into his chariot, and started for the
<div n="lb"/>firmament. He travelled for one lac and a quarter of
<div n="lb"/>yojanas (leagues) and reached the hind part of Rohiṇī,
<div n="lb"/>which is beyond the sun. Adorned with golden gar-
<div n="lb"/>ments and a golden crown studded with jewels, seated
<div n="lb"/>on a golden chariot decorated with precious stones, and a
<div n="lb"/>lofty flagpost and yoked with horses of the colour of
<div n="lb"/>swan, the king shone in the sky as a second sun. He drew
<div n="lb"/>the bow-string right upto his ear and placed in it the
<div n="lb"/>arrow of destruction. When the devas and the asuras
<div n="lb"/>saw the arrow of destruction they began to tremble with
<div n="lb"/>fear. Śani came to Daśaratha and fell before him and
<div n="lb"/>said that he would grant any boon to the King, and
<div n="lb"/>requested him to recall the arrow of destruction. Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>ratha told Śani that he only wanted Śani not to come to
<div n="lb"/>the orbit of Rohiṇī. Śani agreed. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Śani has never entered the orbit of Rohiṇī. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Uttara Kānḍa, Chapter 34).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Death.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa with Sītā went to
<div n="lb"/>live in the forest. Sumantra who accompanied them
<div n="lb"/>up to the river Ganges, returned to the palace. By
<div n="lb"/>then Daśaratha had fallen down filled with grief. He
<div n="lb"/>had never recovered from that state of unconsciousness.
<div n="lb"/>At the time of his death Bharata and Śatrughna had
<div n="lb"/>been away in the kingdom of Kekaya and Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa in the forest. Thus the curse he incurred
<div n="lb"/>in his younger days from the aged hermit, the father of
<div n="lb"/>Śravaṇa, was fully realized.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Daśaratha appears again.%} Rāvaṇa was killed in the
<div n="lb"/>battle. Sītā was tested in fire and found sinless. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>accepted her, seeing that her conjugal fidelity was not
<div n="lb"/>marred. At this time Śiva appeared before Rāma in a
<div n="lb"/>divine aeroplane. Daśaratha was seated in that plane
<div n="lb"/>clad in pure garments. He took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>into his lap and embraced them. He blessed them and
<div n="lb"/>Sītā who was standing with folded hands. Then Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>ratha disappeared. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 122).
