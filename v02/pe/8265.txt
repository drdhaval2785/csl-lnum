VIDŪRATHA III¦. A king who was the friend of the her-
<div n="lb"/>mit Bhalanda. This king had two sons named Sunīti and
<div n="lb"/>Sumati and a daughter named Mudāvatī. One day while
<div n="lb"/>Vidūratha was hunting in the forest, he saw a cleavage
<div n="lb"/>on the earth caused by the yawning of Kujṛmbhāsura.
<div n="lb"/>The king stood there for a while looking at the cleavage.
<div n="lb"/>Then the hermit Suvrata who had been standing close
<div n="lb"/>by approached the king and said. “This asura Kujṛmbha
<div n="lb"/>has a divine pestle with him. Because of the possession
<div n="lb"/>of this pestle he has become invincible and is a threat
<div n="lb"/>to the whole world.”
<div n="NI"/>Vidūratha, who knew everything from Suvrata, lived
<div n="lb"/>cautiously. One day his daughter was carried away by
<div n="lb"/>this Kujṛmbhāsura. Sunīti and Sumati confronted the
<div n="lb"/>asura to rescue their sister but were made captives.
<div n="lb"/>Finally Vatsapri, the son of the hermit Bhalanda killed
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasa (giant) and liberated princess Mudāvatī.
