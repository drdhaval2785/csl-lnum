PAKṢIVAṂŚA¦. The Purāṇic version of the origin of
<div n="lb"/>birds is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Descending in order from Viṣṇu came Brahmā—Marīci
<div n="lb"/>-Kaśyapaprajāpati. The latter got of his wife Tāmrā
<div n="lb"/>(daughter of Dakṣa) five daughters named Krauñcī,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī. From Krauñcī were
<div n="lb"/>born the Ulūkas, Bhāsī gave birth to Bhāsas, Śyenī to
<div n="lb"/>vultures and Dhṛtarāṣṭrī to swans and geese. From
<div n="lb"/>these originated the entire bird family of the world.
