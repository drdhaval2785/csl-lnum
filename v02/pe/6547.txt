SĀYAṆA¦. A hermit who was an expounder of the Vedas.
<div n="lb"/>In course of time, due to the differences in languages
<div n="lb"/>and grammar, the Vedas became difficult to be grasp-
<div n="lb"/>ed. It was Yāska and Sāyaṇa who saved the Indians
<div n="lb"/>from this difficulty. For the Vedas to be grasped easily,
<div n="lb"/>Yāska made the Nirukta (Etymology) and Sāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>wrote the Book Vedārthaprakāśa.
