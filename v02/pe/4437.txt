MATAṄGA III¦. A maharṣi born to a barber of a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin woman. This clandestine birth was not known
<div n="lb"/>either to the brahmin husband or Mataṅga for a long
<div n="lb"/>time. Once his brahmin father sent him to the fields
<div n="lb"/>for ploughing. He put a donkey to the yoke and plough-
<div n="lb"/>ed. When the donkey slowed down its work Mataṅga
<div n="lb"/>beat it hard. The mother of the donkey saw it and wept.
<div n="lb"/>She called Mataṅga to her side and told him that he
<div n="lb"/>was the son of a barber and that was why he behaved
<div n="lb"/>like a caṇḍāla showing no kindness to wards the animal.
<div n="lb"/>Mataṅga ran to his house and told his parents what
<div n="lb"/>the mother-donkey said. After that he left his house
<div n="lb"/>and did penance to become a brahmin. Indra was
<div n="lb"/>pleased and he asked Mataṅga what he wanted and he
<div n="lb"/>replied he wanted to become a brahmin. Indra made
<div n="lb"/>him a brahmin and sent him back. (Chapter 27, Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva).
