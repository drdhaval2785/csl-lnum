DURYODHANA I¦. Villain in the Mahābhārata story;
<div n="lb"/>the eldest and greatest of the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Birth.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra born blind married Gāndhārī.
<div n="lb"/>Hungry and thirsty, Vyāsa once came to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
<div n="lb"/>palace where Gāndhārī treated him sumptuously, and
<div n="lb"/>he blessed her to have hundred sons by her husband.
<div n="lb"/>Ere long Gāndhārī conceived, but even after two years
<div n="lb"/>she did not deliver. Grief-stricken at this she got
<div n="lb"/>herself aborted in secret as the result of which she
<div n="lb"/>‘delivered’ a mass of flesh, and hearing about it Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>visited her. As instructed by him hundred pots were filled
<div n="lb"/>with ghee, and the mass of flesh was sprayed with cold
<div n="lb"/>water as a result of which it got divided into hundred
<div n="lb"/>pieces, each the size of a thumb. Also a smaller piece of
<div n="lb"/>flesh remained. Those pieces of flesh were deposited in the
<div n="lb"/>pots filled with ghee and the pots kept in a secret place.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa departed for the Himālayas for tapas.
<div n="NI"/>In course of time the pots burst open one by one and
<div n="lb"/>from each pot emerged a boy. From the 101st pot a girl
<div n="lb"/>was born. Eldest among the boys was named
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana, and the girl called Duśśalā. (For other
<div n="lb"/>names see under Kauravas).
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana, at the time of his birth cried in the voice
<div n="lb"/>of an ass on hearing which the asses kept in their shed
<div n="lb"/>also cried. Also, such evil omens as the jackal howling,
<div n="lb"/>birds like crows, vultures etc. crying and storms break-
<div n="lb"/>ing out were witnessed on the occasion. Alarmed by
<div n="lb"/>such evil omens Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent for the brahmins and
<div n="lb"/>his other friends and well-wishers like Bhīṣma and Vidura
<div n="lb"/>and enquired of them whether, after the death of
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra, Duryodhana would be able to become
<div n="lb"/>King. As soon as Dhṛtarāṣṭra had asked the question, evil
<div n="lb"/>omens like the world becoming dim, jackals howling etc.
<div n="lb"/>were witnessed again. Scholars like Vidura did their best
<div n="lb"/>to divine what the future of Duryodhana would be, and
<div n="lb"/>after mature consideration Vidura and the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>pandits opined that because of Duryodhana's birth the
<div n="lb"/>country and people would be ruined, and they, there-
<div n="lb"/>fore advised that he should be cast away and forsaken.
<div n="lb"/>But, paternal affection did not permit Dhṛtarāṣṭra to
<div n="lb"/>accept the advice.
<div n="NI"/>During this period Gāndhārī was laid up for a few days
<div n="lb"/>with stomach trouble, and a vaiśya woman was engaged
[Page258-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to look after Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who begot of her a son called
<div n="lb"/>Yuyutsu.
<F>1. Vyāsa blessed Gāndhārī to have 100 sons. Then how was it that she got a daughter too? On being questioned thus by King
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya Vaiśaṃpāyana replied “when Vyāsa was dividing the mass of flesh a desire to have a daughter entered the heart of Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>and divining that desire Vyāsa cut the flesh in such a manner as to have one more piece, viz. 101</F> Thus with 100 sons and Duśśalā for daughter
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra became rich in the matter of children
<F>2. Duryodhana was born as a part of Kali. (M.B. Āśrama vāsika Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Adi Parva, Chapter 114).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Duryodhana harms Bhīmasena.%} Now, Pāṇḍu was
<div n="lb"/>dead and Mādrī also died in the funeral pyre of her
<div n="lb"/>husband. Forlorn and helpless Kuntī and her five sons
<div n="lb"/>came to Hastināpura, and Dhṛtarāṣṭra welcomed them
<div n="lb"/>to the palace. Thus arose the occasion for the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kauravas to live together in the Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura palace. And, naturally there used to be petty
<div n="lb"/>differences and quarrels between the Pāṇḍava and
<div n="lb"/>Kaurava princes. Bhīma being in every way a giant the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas had often to suffer at his hands. To collect all
<div n="lb"/>the hundred Kaurava brothers together and throw them
<div n="lb"/>away in one lump to push them to the ground, to suffo-
<div n="lb"/>cate them by holding their heads under water etc—these
<div n="lb"/>were some of the childish pranks played by Bhīma on
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas. The constant repetition of such pranks
<div n="lb"/>and mischiefs on the part of Bhīma rendered him an
<div n="lb"/>object of hatred for the Kauravas among whom the
<div n="lb"/>common conviction grew that it was essential to put an
<div n="lb"/>end to Bhīma's life for their safety, nay even their very
<div n="lb"/>existence.
<div n="NI"/>One day, the Kauravas, with the object of doing away
<div n="lb"/>with Bhīma, escorted the Pāṇḍavas to Pramāṇakoṭi on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the Gaṅgā for water sports. There all of
<div n="lb"/>them ate sumptuous meals and took various drinks. But,
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana had secretly mixed Kālakūṭa poison in the
<div n="lb"/>food of Bhīma. After taking meals they began playing
<div n="lb"/>water-sports. After the sports were over they returned
<div n="lb"/>to their tents and slept. Owing to the effects of the
<div n="lb"/>poison and the overexertion during the day Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>slept stone dead. While all were asleep during the night
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana bound the hands and legs of Bhīma with
<div n="lb"/>cords and threw him into the depths of the Gāṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma who was still unconscious sank down to the very
<div n="lb"/>bottom of the river where the denizens of nāgaloka saw
<div n="lb"/>him and the nāgas bit him in anger. The poison of the
<div n="lb"/>nāgas neutralised the effects of Kālakūṭa poison in
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma, though their bite could not make even a scratch
<div n="lb"/>on his skin. Freed thus from the effects of poison Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>shook himself up from sleep and drove off the nāgas.
<div n="lb"/>Alarmed at these developments the nāgas called Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>up to the scene, and he, recognising Bhīma held him in
<div n="lb"/>embrace and gave him much money and costly gems
<div n="lb"/>etc. Bhīma refused the gifts, but asked Vāsuki for nāga-
<div n="lb"/>rasa, which would impart the strength of thousand nāgas
<div n="lb"/>to those who used it. Vāsuki gave Bhīma eight potfuls
<div n="lb"/>of nāgarasa, which the latter drank to the last dregs
<div n="lb"/>and thus gained immeasurable strength.
<div n="NI"/>When next morning after the water-sports the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kauravas awoke from sleep Bhīma was found
<div n="lb"/>missing. Duryodhana said that Bhīma had returned
<div n="lb"/>earlier to Hastināpura, but this did not satisfy the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. Kuntī lamented over the absence of Bhīma.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīma, who drank the nāga rasa lay on the veranda of
<div n="lb"/>Vāsuki for eight days in the manner of one who had
<div n="lb"/>lost consciousness. By the time he woke up on the eighth
<div n="lb"/>day the body had almost fully assimilated the rasa.
<div n="lb"/>Vāsuki told Bhīma that eight potfuls of nāgarasa
[Page258-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>would impart the strength of 10,000 elephants. And
<div n="lb"/>then at the instance of Vāsuki Bhīma took his bath in
<div n="lb"/>holy waters and wore new clothes and fragrant garland.
<div n="lb"/>He ate the pudding offered by Vāsuki, and taking leave
<div n="lb"/>of him and followed by nāgas he came up from the
<div n="lb"/>water to the bank of the Gaṅgā. Bhīma gave a detailed
<div n="lb"/>description to his mother and brothers of all that had
<div n="lb"/>happened to him. Dharmaputra advised him to keep
<div n="lb"/>the secret. After the incident, once again was Kālakūṭa
<div n="lb"/>poison mixed in the food of Bhīma. But, Yuyutsu born
<div n="lb"/>of the vaiśya woman to Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>confidential report about it. Because of the powerful
<div n="lb"/>effect of nāga rasa, the Kālakūṭa consumed by Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>did no harm to him but it only got assimilated in his
<div n="lb"/>body. On another occasion Duryodhana killed the
<div n="lb"/>charioteer of Bhīma. (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Chapter 127 and
<div n="lb"/>129).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Karṇa crowned king of Aṅga.%} The Kauravas and the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas learnt the use of weapons of war at the feet
<div n="lb"/>of Droṇācārya, and when the studies were over arrange-
<div n="lb"/>ments were made for a rehearsal, and at the rehearsal
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma and Duryodhana were the first to clash with
<div n="lb"/>each other. When the encounter reached its climax
<div n="lb"/>both of them pointed the club at each other. But, Aśvat-
<div n="lb"/>thāmā intervened and pacified them. Next Karṇa enter-
<div n="lb"/>ed the stage for a trial of strength with Arjuna, and
<div n="lb"/>at once arose from the Pāṇḍava side questions about
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa's nobility and aristocracy of birth etc. Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>stood there stunned, not knowing what to say or how
<div n="lb"/>to repel the attack. Then it was Duryodhana who rose
<div n="lb"/>up to announce that he was, that very moment, crowning
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa King of Aṅga. This ended the scene. (Bhārata
<div n="lb"/>(Malayālam), Ādi Parva, Chapters 134, 135 and 136).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Pāṇḍavas trapped in palace built of lac.%} The above
<div n="lb"/>incident confirmed and completed the cleavage of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas into two hostile camps.
<div n="lb"/>Meantime another event happened. Droṇācārya demand-
<div n="lb"/>ed of his pupils to bring before him King Drupada
<div n="lb"/>by way of gurudakṣiṇā (tuition fee), for the ācārya had
<div n="lb"/>to wreak vengeance upon Drupada (See under Droṇa).
<div n="lb"/>Though Duryodhana tried his best he could not capture
<div n="lb"/>Drupada. Not only that, Drupada defeated him also in
<div n="lb"/>fight. At this juncture it was Arjuna who presented
<div n="lb"/>Drupada as captive to Droṇa by way of gurudakṣiṇā.
<div n="lb"/>The incident proved to be another provocation for
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana to hate the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>Now, Duryodhana made up his mind to destroy the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas somehow or other. With this end in view he
<div n="lb"/>went to his father, posing himself to be a great well-
<div n="lb"/>wisher of the Pāṇḍavas, and obtained his permission to
<div n="lb"/>transfer their (Pāṇḍavas') residence to another palace.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Duryodhana deputed his minister Purocana
<div n="lb"/>to get built at Vāraṇāvata a palace of lac. Vidura came
<div n="lb"/>to know of the intended mischief and gave advance
<div n="lb"/>notice of it to the Pāṇḍavas through a messenger
<div n="lb"/>Kanaka. The architect built the ‘lac palace’ but built a
<div n="lb"/>tunnel also attached to it. A year after the Pāṇḍavas shift-
<div n="lb"/>ed the residence to the new ‘palace’ Duryodhana set.
<div n="lb"/>fire to it, and the Pāṇḍavas escaped unscathed through
<div n="lb"/>this tunnel. (Bhārata (Malayālam) Ādi Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>141-151).
[Page259-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Duryodhana invited the Pāṇḍavas back to Hastināpura.%}
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana and his brothers were living very happily
<div n="lb"/>under the impression that the Pāṇḍavas had been burnt
<div n="lb"/>to ashes along with the ‘lac Palace’. Then it was that
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas, disguised as brahmins and in the presence
<div n="lb"/>of all the Kings, won Pāñcālī, the daughter of King
<div n="lb"/>Drupada, in svayaṃvara, for their wife. After the
<div n="lb"/>marriage the Pāṇḍavas stayed in Drupada's palace and
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas returned to Hastināpura. Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>and others felt all the more jealous at the Pāṇḍavas'
<div n="lb"/>becoming more powerful as a result of their marriage.
<div n="lb"/>Again it was decided that the Pāṇḍavas should be des-
<div n="lb"/>troyed anyhow and at any cost. But, how to effect the
<div n="lb"/>destruction? Duryodhana wanted to attract the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas to destruction through women and to create diffe-
<div n="lb"/>rences and divisions among them. But, Karṇa attacked
<div n="lb"/>the plan as impracticable, and instead he wanted to
<div n="lb"/>defeat Drupada and render the Pāṇḍavas impotent. At
<div n="lb"/>this stage Bhīṣma and Droṇa argued that it was most
<div n="lb"/>preferable to give half the Kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and receive them with grace. Dhṛtarāṣṭra supported
<div n="lb"/>the proposal as a result of which the Kauravas went to
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla and escorted the Pāṇḍavas back to Hasti-
<div n="lb"/>nāpura. Dhṛtarāṣṭra partitioned the country between
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas and the latter shifted
<div n="lb"/>their residence to their part of the country with Khāṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍavaprastḥa (Indraprastha) as its capital. When the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas went to Indraprastha Maya built for them
<div n="lb"/>aṇ exceptionally beautiful palace where King Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra performed {%rājasūya.%} Duryodhana and others ear-
<div n="lb"/>nestly participated in it. After the rājasūya the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas wanted to have a look at the palace and in the
<div n="lb"/>course of surveying it they placed themselves in
<div n="lb"/>ridiculous situations due to visual illusions. Taking the
<div n="lb"/>bright floors of glass for watery tanks they pulled up
<div n="lb"/>their clothings and measured with caution every foot of
<div n="lb"/>theirs. Then they mistook actual pools for floor and fell
<div n="lb"/>into them and got wet. At the consequent discomfiture
<div n="lb"/>of the Kauravas Bhīma clapped his hands and roared
<div n="lb"/>with laughter. Draupadī hid her face with hands and
<div n="lb"/>smiled. Altogether the Kauravas cut a very ridiculous
<div n="lb"/>figure, and they returned to Hastināpura. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 202, Sabhā Parva, Chapters 35, 85).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Dharmaputra's first defeat in the game of dice.%} The
<div n="lb"/>sight of the great wealth including costly stones and
<div n="lb"/>gems presented by various kings to Dharmaputra at the
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya and the humiliation experienced while survey-
<div n="lb"/>ing the palace made Duryodhana all the more mad
<div n="lb"/>with anger and hatred towards the Pāṇḍavas. He now
<div n="lb"/>came to the decision either to defeat the Pāṇḍavas once
<div n="lb"/>for all or to commit suicide by taking poison. He held
<div n="lb"/>secret consultations on the topic with Śakuni whose
<div n="lb"/>efforts at first to pacify him (Duryodhana) failed. Ulti-
<div n="lb"/>mately Śakuni, an expert in the game of dice, advised
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana to invite Dharmaputra to a game, assuring
<div n="lb"/>him that the rest he would take care of. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
<div n="lb"/>Vidura advised Duryodhana against the move, but he
<div n="lb"/>did not yield. Finally Dhṛtarāṣṭra, saying to himself
<div n="lb"/>that nobody would change fate, agreed to Duryodhana's
<div n="lb"/>proposal, and deputed Vidura to Dharmaputra to invite
<div n="lb"/>him for the game.
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra, in fact, did not like the game, but he
<div n="lb"/>succumbed to the eloquence and persuasive powers of
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni and at last agreed to play. Kings lined up the
[Page259-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>royal hall to witness the game. First gems were staked.
<div n="lb"/>and Duryodhana won the game. Then 1000 golden niṣkas
<F>1. 108 suvarṇa weight, an ornament worn on the chest.</F>
<div n="lb"/>and treasuries were offered to the winner. Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>won that game also. Next chariot with horses and next
<div n="lb"/>to that 1000 maid-servants were staked and Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>won those games too. 1000 horses, 1000 golden chariots
<div n="lb"/>with their horses, the horse decorated with gold presen-
<div n="lb"/>ted by Citraratha to Arjuna, 6000 soldiers with their
<div n="lb"/>arms and armaments—these formed the next successive
<div n="lb"/>bets, and each game Dharmaputra lost. The next bet
<div n="lb"/>was 400 copper vessels each filled with pure gold, and
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana won that game also. And, now Vidura
<div n="lb"/>tried to dissuade Yudhiṣṭhira from playing the game;
<div n="lb"/>but neither he nor Duryodhana heeded the advice. And,
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana by foul play snatched from Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>all his wealth, his kingdom and his brothers. Now, Pāñ-
<div n="lb"/>cālī alone remained, and Dharmaputra bet her too
<div n="lb"/>and played the last game and lost.
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana deputed his Sūta, Prātikāmi, to Indra-
<div n="lb"/>prastha, to fetch Draupadī but she sent him back. Next
<div n="lb"/>Duśśāsana was deputed and he brought Pāñcālī to the
<div n="lb"/>sabhā dragging her by the hair. She was proclaimed to
<div n="lb"/>be the maid-servant of the Kauravas. At last Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>intervened and sent back the Pāṇḍavas along with
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī to Indraprastha.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Second game and exile in the forest.%} Duryodhana and
<div n="lb"/>others did not appreciate the intervention of their father.
<div n="lb"/>He again conspired with Śakuni and it was decided to
<div n="lb"/>challenge Dharmaputra to one more game. The condi-
<div n="lb"/>tions to be stipulated were that the vanquished in the
<div n="lb"/>game should stay in exile for twelve years in the forest
<div n="lb"/>and live incognito during the thirteenth year, and if
<div n="lb"/>found out and recognised during this period the whole
<div n="lb"/>process of exile and life incognito would have to be
<div n="lb"/>repeated. Duryodhana and Śukuni approached Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra and said to him thus: “Dear father, the desire
<div n="lb"/>for revenge at their defeat in the game of dice gnaws
<div n="lb"/>at the Pāṇḍavas' heart like poison. Also, they will never
<div n="lb"/>forget our having dragged Draupadī by her hair. When
<div n="lb"/>a suitable occasion arises they will take revenge on the
<div n="lb"/>whole lot of us. Therefore, we want to challenge
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra to a final game of dice, the condition
<div n="lb"/>being that he who gets defeated should go in exile into
<div n="lb"/>the forest for twelve years and then to live incognito
<div n="lb"/>for one year. If we get defeated we will simply carry
<div n="lb"/>out the condition on our part.
<div n="NI"/>This request of Duryodhana appealed to his father, who
<div n="lb"/>invited Dharmaputra once again for a game of dice.
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra accepted the invitation, in fact, in spite
<div n="lb"/>of himself. This time too Duryodhana won the stake
<div n="lb"/>and the Pāṇḍavas set out to the forest. Even at the
<div n="lb"/>time of parting Duśśāsana insulted Bhīma who retorted
<div n="lb"/>thus: “You, mean fellows, you cheated my brother by
<div n="lb"/>foul play. If I fail to tear your heart open in fight and
<div n="lb"/>drink blood I do not want heaven. Moreover I will kill
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana, and Arjuna will kill Karṇa. Śakuni, the
<div n="lb"/>expert in foul play in dice will be killed by Sahadeva.
<div n="lb"/>We will meet in the 14th year from today at the
<div n="lb"/>battlefield. Adieu.”
<div n="NI"/>Thus did the Pāṇḍavas depart for the forest. Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>being too old Vidura took her to his house, and he
<div n="lb"/>consoled her, lamenting over the separation from her
<div n="lb"/>children. (M.B. Sabhā Parva).
[Page260-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Curse of Maitreya.%} The Pāṇḍavas entered the
<div n="lb"/>Kāmyaka forest where they were welcomed by the
<div n="lb"/>sages. Among them Maitreya whom the misfortune
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas affected much started for Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>for peace parleys. Vidura advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
<div n="lb"/>Maitreya's proposals should be respected lest he should
<div n="lb"/>curse the King. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Duryodhana received
<div n="lb"/>the sage with respect. And, the sage asked them to
<div n="lb"/>recall the Pāṇḍavas from the forest and live on friendly
<div n="lb"/>terms with them. Duryodhana did not in any manner
<div n="lb"/>respond to the advice of the sage, but stood there
<div n="lb"/>absolutely mum tapping his thigh with his fingers and
<div n="lb"/>making drawings with the fingers of his feet on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. This the sage interpreted as an insult to him.
<div n="lb"/>He stood up ablaze with anger and cursed Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>thus: “You will, sooner than later reap the conse-
<div n="lb"/>quences of your false pride; your cruelty will invite
<div n="lb"/>terrible war, and in the fight Bhīma will rend asunder
<div n="lb"/>your thigh, which you struck with your fingers
<div n="lb"/>just now.”
<div n="NI"/>Greatly agitated over the curse Dhṛtarāṣṭra prayed
<div n="lb"/>the sage for redemption and the sage said: “if only
<div n="lb"/>your son resorts to forbearance and peace the curse
<div n="lb"/>will not take effect, otherwise it will come true.” And
<div n="lb"/>after making this announcement the sage returned to
<div n="lb"/>the forest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The procession.%} While the Pāṇḍavas were staying
<div n="lb"/>in the Kāmyaka forest Duryodhana and others went
<div n="lb"/>there on the pretext of looking after the cows. The
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas took them captive; but the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>intervened and set them free. Feeling humiliated at the
<div n="lb"/>mishap Duryodhana decided to end his life after crown-
<div n="lb"/>ing Duśśāsana as King. But Duśśāsana did not agree
<div n="lb"/>to the proposal. (For details see Ghoṣayātrā).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Duryodhana's attempt at death and his trip to Pātāla.%}
<div n="lb"/>Humiliated at the procession thus and turning down
<div n="lb"/>the advice of friends to return to the palace, Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana spread grass on the ground and lay down there
<div n="lb"/>to die. As his death would spell disaster to the Dānavas
<div n="lb"/>they decided to send him back to his palace for which
<div n="lb"/>purpose they performed the Vaitāna sacrifice in Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>While offering milk in the sacrificial fire a Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>woman, Kṛtyā, arose therefrom, and at the instance
<div n="lb"/>of the Dānavas she carried Duryodhana over to Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>There they told him thus: “Oh Duryodhana, a part
<div n="lb"/>of your body has been earned by us from Śiva by our
<div n="lb"/>penance. That part of your body above the waist is
<div n="lb"/>made of diamond. Therefore, arrows will not pierce
<div n="lb"/>your body. Grieve not. Bhagadatta and other heroes
<div n="lb"/>have been born to help you. Your great supporter
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa is possessed of the soul of Narakāsura.” These
<div n="lb"/>words of the Dānavas instilled fresh hope in Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana, and he was taken back to his Kingdom by Kṛtyā.
<div n="lb"/>This incident appeared as a dream to Duryodhana.
<div n="lb"/>Bucking up confidence and courage again he returned
<div n="lb"/>to Hastināpura and continued to rule (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 252).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Duryodhana's Viṣṇu yajña.%} At this juncture Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana thought of performing a Rājasūya for which he
<div n="lb"/>invited brahmins to the palace. After bestowing much
<div n="lb"/>thought on the subject the brahmins pointed out that
<div n="lb"/>there was no sanction for Duryodhana to conduct a
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya as his elders, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>were still alive. At the same time they pointed out that
[Page260-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>there was another Yajña called Viṣṇu Yajña as efficaci-
<div n="lb"/>ous as Rājasūya which Duryodhana was competent to
<div n="lb"/>perform. Accordingly Duryodhana performed the Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>yajña and earned reputation among evil monarchs.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 256, 257).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Boon from Durvāsas.%} Once Durvāsas accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by his disciples, came to Duryodhana's palace, and
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana decided somehow or other to befriend and
<div n="lb"/>use the maharṣi as a weapon against the Pāṇḍavas. He
<div n="lb"/>housed the maharṣi and his disciples in the palace for
<div n="lb"/>a few days and pleased them by careful service at which
<div n="lb"/>the maharṣi asked Duryodhana to request for any boon
<div n="lb"/>he desired. And, Duryodhana asked the maharṣi to
<div n="lb"/>visit the Pāṇḍavas one day in the forest with his disciples
<div n="lb"/>when they had finished taking their meals. The
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi agreed. And, this was the period of time when
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī had received the akṣayapātra from Sūrya.
<div n="lb"/>Everyday the pātra would produce enough food for the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and the other people with them, but it would
<div n="lb"/>become empty for the day after Pāñcālī had eaten her
<div n="lb"/>food. This was the nature of the akṣayapātra.
<div n="NI"/>Pāñcālī had finished her meals one day when Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>and his disciples came to the Pāṇḍavas. Not knowing
<div n="lb"/>that Pāñcālī had already finished her food Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra welcomed the maharṣi and his disciples and
<div n="lb"/>requested them to take bath in the Gaṅgā and return for
<div n="lb"/>their meals. Pāñcālī was in a fix. The akṣayapātra
<div n="lb"/>would not produce any more food for the day, and if
<div n="lb"/>not duly fed the maharṣi would get angry and curse
<div n="lb"/>them. In this painful dilemma she prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>for succour, and lo! he appeared and asked Pāñcālī for
<div n="lb"/>some food. She replied that the akṣayapātra was quite
<div n="lb"/>empty. But, Kṛṣṇa got from her the pātra and ate one
<div n="lb"/>particle of Kīra (a leafy vegetable) which had stuck on
<div n="lb"/>its side. That leafy substance fully satisfied his hunger
<div n="lb"/>and thirst whereupon the hunger and thirst of Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>and his disciples were also quenched. Then Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>asked Sahadeva to bring back the maharṣi and his
<div n="lb"/>disciples from the bank of the Gaṅgā and accordingly
<div n="lb"/>he went there and invited them. Only a few minutes
<div n="lb"/>had passed since the maharṣi and his disciples had felt
<div n="lb"/>the satisfaction of a sumptuous meal. They were also
<div n="lb"/>astonished to think how in such a short time food for so
<div n="lb"/>many people could be cooked by Pāñcālī. They felt
<div n="lb"/>rather anxious about the reaction which Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>would evince in case they returned to him to say that
<div n="lb"/>they required no food. Durvāsas realised only too well
<div n="lb"/>that to quarrel with the Pāṇḍavas, who enjoyed the
<div n="lb"/>friendship and support of Kṛṣṇa was like playing with
<div n="lb"/>fire. Therefore, the maharṣi with his disciples ran away
<div n="lb"/>from the place secretly. Pāṇḍavas waited long for the
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi and his disciples to return fearing that the object
<div n="lb"/>of Durvāsas might be to return at the untimely hour
<div n="lb"/>and curse them. But, Śrī Kṛṣṇa told them the details
<div n="lb"/>about the maharṣi's departure and assured Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra that he and his disciples would not return. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 263).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%War against Virāṭa.%} After twelve years' exile in the
<div n="lb"/>forest the Pāṇḍavas began their life incognito at Virāṭa
<div n="lb"/>nagara. Kīcaka, brother-in-law of Mātsya, the Virāṭa
<div n="lb"/>King, was killed secretly by Bhīmasena, and news was
<div n="lb"/>spread that Kīcaka was killed by a Gandharva.
<div n="NI"/>None of the spies deputed by Duryodhana to spot out
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas during their life incognito could gather
[Page261-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>any information about them. One of those days
<div n="lb"/>Suśarman, King of Trigarta, told Duryodhana that the
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa King had lost his power and spirits due to the
<div n="lb"/>death of Kīcaka and it was, therefore, the proper time
<div n="lb"/>to attack the Virāṭa country and subjugate it thor-
<div n="lb"/>oughly. The idea appealed to Karṇa, who prompted
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana to war against Virāṭa. The army was
<div n="lb"/>fully mobilised. As an excuse for the war, at the ins-
<div n="lb"/>tance of Duryodhana, Suśarman, King of Trigarta
<div n="lb"/>lifted innumerable cows of the Virāṭa King. This
<div n="lb"/>happened on the day on which the life incognito of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas was to have ended. And war started thus.
<div n="lb"/>The Virāṭa prince Uttara who spent his time in the
<div n="lb"/>zenana in the palace appeared in the field of war.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, under the assumed name of Bṛhannala took up
<div n="lb"/>the charioteership of Uttara. But, at the sight of the
<div n="lb"/>vast Kaurava army Uttara fainted, and Arjuna hurried-
<div n="lb"/>ly drove the chariot over to where his bow gāṇḍīva
<div n="lb"/>was kept hidden, and with the bow in his hands Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>jumped into the thick of the fight. A fierce war ensued
<div n="lb"/>in which the Kaurava army was completely routed.
<div n="lb"/>The life incognito of the Pāṇḍavas was also over, and
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana became naturally anxious about the future
<div n="lb"/>of things. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Preparation for war.%} Duryodhana refused to give
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇdavas, even after their return from twelve years'
<div n="lb"/>exile in forest and one year's life incognito, even ‘as much
<div n="lb"/>land as would hold a pin’, and war became inevitable.
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas fought the great war which
<div n="lb"/>lasted for eighteen days on the field of Kurukṣetra.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Duryodhana went to invite Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Preparations for
<div n="lb"/>the war were gathering speed and momentum. Both
<div n="lb"/>the sides were on the look out for more friends and
<div n="lb"/>allies. Being told that Arjuna had gone to Dvārakā to
<div n="lb"/>seek Kṛṣṇa's support Duryodhana rushed to the place.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing Duryodhana from a distance Kṛṣṇa lay on his
<div n="lb"/>bed in a false sleep, and Duryodhana took his seat
<div n="lb"/>on a stool at the head of the bed awaiting Kṛṣṇa to
<div n="lb"/>awake from sleep. Soon after, Arjuna came there and
<div n="lb"/>he stood at the feet of Kṛṣṇa with head bowed down.
<div n="lb"/>When Kṛṣṇa awoke from sleep it was Arjuna whom he
<div n="lb"/>saw first, and while exchanging greetings with Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>he was told that it was Duryodhana, who had come
<div n="lb"/>first. But when Duryodhana and Arjuna explained the
<div n="lb"/>object of their visit he told them thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“No doubt it was Duryodhana who came first. But, it
<div n="lb"/>was Arjuna whom I met first. Since Duryodhana came
<div n="lb"/>first and I saw Arjuna first I shall help both of you in
<div n="lb"/>war. There is the adage that youngsters should be
<div n="lb"/>given priority of consideration. So, Arjuna may indi-
<div n="lb"/>cate his preference first. I shall give one of you an army
<div n="lb"/>of 10 lakhs of warriors as strong in body as myself,
<div n="lb"/>and I shall stand by the other without arms and with-
<div n="lb"/>out fighting. Arjuna may make his choice first. And,
<div n="lb"/>he chose Kṛṣṇa for his side in the war while Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>was happy to get Kṛṣṇa's mighty army. (M.B. Udyoga-
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Duryodhana sought Balabhadra's help but Bala-
<div n="lb"/>bhadra told him frankly that since he could not forsake
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa he would remain neutral in the war. (M. B.
<div n="lb"/>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 25).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Duryodhana got an akṣauhiṇī (a specific division of
<div n="lb"/>army) from Kṛtavarman. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Śalya promised to captain the Kaurava army.
[Page261-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Duryodhana could collect a total of eleven akṣa-
<div n="lb"/>uhiṇīs. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(6) He assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the Kaurava army
<div n="lb"/>would easily defeat the Pāṇḍava army. (M.B. Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 57).
<div n="NI"/>(7) He declared that war was a yajña. (M.B. Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>(8) At the instance of Dhṛtarāṣṭra a rest house was
<div n="lb"/>built for Śrī Kṛṣṇa on his way to the Kauravas for
<div n="lb"/>compromise talks on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas. (Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 85).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Duryodhana opined that Kṛṣṇa be taken captive
<div n="lb"/>when he came to plead for compromise and peace,
<div n="lb"/>but the others did not support him. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 83, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Duryodhana worshipped Kṛṣṇa with rare and
<div n="lb"/>excellent things and invited him for meals, but Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>did not accept any. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>91, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Duryodhana rejected the advice of sage Kaṇva
<div n="lb"/>to come to terms with the Pāṇḍavas. (Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 97-105).
<div n="NI"/>(12) He emphatically announced in the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>assembly that even as much land as may be required
<div n="lb"/>to hold a pin would not be given to the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 26).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Kṛṣṇa's pleadings in the Kaurava assembly for
<div n="lb"/>peace and amity on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas failed to
<div n="lb"/>have any effect. On the occasion Duryodhana, Śakuni,
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa and Duśśāsana conspired to take Kṛṣṇa captive.
<div n="lb"/>Sātyaki informed Kṛṣṇa secretly about the conspiracy
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra about it, and he
<div n="lb"/>warned the conspirators against their wicked plan.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 13, Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Duryodhana appointed Kṛpa, Droṇa, Śalya,
<div n="lb"/>Jayadratha, Hārdika, Aśvatthāmā, Karṇa, Śakuni,
<div n="lb"/>Bālhīka and Kāmboja as commanders of the army.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 155).
<div n="NI"/>(15) Duryodhana appointed Bhīṣma as the Commander
<div n="lb"/>in-Chief of the army. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156
<div n="lb"/>verse 26).
<div n="NI"/>(16) He appointed Ulūka as messenger and warned
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Pāṇḍavas, Drupada, Virāṭa, Śikhaṇḍī,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛṣṭadyumna and others. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>10).
<div n="NI"/>(17) He ordered the army to the Kurukṣetra field.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 195).
<div n="NI"/>(18) He appointed Duśśāsana as Bhīṣma's body-guard.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(19) On the flag staff of Duryodhana studded with gems
<div n="lb"/>his flag with the serpent's emblem flew high in the air.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 17, Verse 25).
<div n="NI"/>(20) He learnt from Droṇa the names of heroes on
<div n="lb"/>both sides before the fighting started. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 25).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Duryodhana in battlefield.%} The following incidents
<div n="lb"/>relating to Duryodhana in actual war have been noted.
<div n="NI"/>(1) In the first day's fighting he fainted, hit by the
<div n="lb"/>arrows of Bhīma. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 58, Verse 17).

<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 23, Verse 7).

<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 73).
