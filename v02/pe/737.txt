ĀṄGIRASĪ¦. A very chaste wife of a Brahmin. By the
<div n="lb"/>curse of Śakti, son of Vasiṣṭha Kalmāṣapāda, a king of
<div n="lb"/>the Ikṣvāku dynasty became a demon. That demon
<div n="lb"/>killed and devoured the husband of Āṅgirasī. Enraged
<div n="lb"/>at this the Brahmin lady cursed Kalmāṣapāda saying
<div n="lb"/>that if he touched his wife thereafter he would die.
<div n="lb"/>That was why Vasiṣṭha had to beget a son for Kal-
<div n="lb"/>māṣapāda of his wife. (Ślokas 16-22, Chapter 181, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
