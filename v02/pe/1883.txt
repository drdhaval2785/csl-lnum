<div n="lb"/>He once received without due regard and with indif-
<div n="lb"/>ference the tīrtha water given to him by a devotee of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa after worship of the Lord, as a result of which,
<div n="lb"/>in the next birth, he was born as a bamboo stem. And,
<div n="lb"/>as he did, consciously or otherwise some good deeds Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa made a flute out of that bamboo stem, and
<div n="lb"/>Devavrata thus attained redemption. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 73).
