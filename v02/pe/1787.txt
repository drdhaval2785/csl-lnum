DASYU¦. The ancient dwellers of North India. What
<div n="lb"/>we see in Ṛgveda is mostly a history of the Āryans from
<div n="lb"/>the period of their exodus from the plateau Kumbha
<div n="lb"/>till they reached the banks of the Yamunā. The plateau
<div n="lb"/>of Kuṃbha is Kabul. The Dasyus were the first people
<div n="lb"/>the Aryans had to confront with after passing the Indus.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda bears testimony to the fact that the civilization
<div n="lb"/>of the Dasyus was far advanced than that of the Āryans.
<div n="lb"/>Śaṃbara, King of the Dasyus, was the ruler of hundred
<div n="lb"/>cities. All the cities were fortified with strong walls and
<div n="lb"/>fortresses, which are described as ‘aśvamayī’, ‘āyasī’,
<div n="lb"/>‘śatabhujī’ etc. The greatest enemies of the Āryans were
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Paṇis’ of these cities. They were a particular class
<div n="lb"/>of people of these cities. In the ‘Nirukta of Yāska’ it is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned that paṇis were traders. Names of many of the
<div n="lb"/>Kings of the Dasyus occur in the Ṛgveda. Dhuni,
<div n="lb"/>Cumuri, Pipru, Varcas, Śaṃbara and such others are the
<div n="lb"/>most valiant and mighty among them. The most impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant of the several tribes of the Dasyus were the Śimyus,
<div n="lb"/>the Kīkaṭas, Śigrus and the Yakṣus. They are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as the Anāsas in the Ṛgveda. (Anāsas—without nose).
<div n="lb"/>Perhaps their nose was flat; more over they are stated as
<div n="lb"/>having dark complexion. So it may be assumed that the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyus were Dravidians. They talked a primitive
<div n="lb"/>language, and they despised sacrificial religion. They did
<div n="lb"/>not worship Gods like Indra and others. They possibly
<div n="lb"/>worshipped the Phallus, Śiva, Devi and the like.
