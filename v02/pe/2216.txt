DUṢYANTA I¦. A reputed King of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti—Pūru—Janamejaya—Pracinvān—Namasyu—
<div n="lb"/>Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahugava—Saṃyāti—Rahovādī
<div n="lb"/>Raudrāśva—Matināra—Santurodha—Duṣyanta.
<div n="NI"/>Matināra had two sons: Santurodha and Pratiratha,
<div n="lb"/>and Santurodha had three sons: Duṣyanta
<F>1. The genealogy given above has been taken jointly from Agnipurāṇa, Bhāgavata and Viṣṇupurāṇa. But the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 17) gives Ilin as the name of Duṣyanta's father and Rathantī as that of his mother. It may be
<div n="lb"/>surmised that Santurodha and Ilin were one and the same individual.</F> Pravīra
<div n="lb"/>and Sumanta. Pratiratha begot Kaṇva and he, Medhā-
<div n="lb"/>tithi.
<div n="NI"/>{%His reign.%} Within a short period of time Duṣyanta
<div n="lb"/>became the emperor of India. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 3). His empire extended up to the sea, and he
<div n="lb"/>became an object of envy for other rulers. Under his rule
<div n="lb"/>the four castes flourished in affluence. None was threa-
<div n="lb"/>tened with illness or by thieves. The seasons marched
<div n="lb"/>in due order, the clouds raining at the proper time etc.
<div n="lb"/>“Like the ocean not getting agitated, and putting up
<div n="lb"/>with everything with unique patience like the earth,
<div n="lb"/>Duṣyanta ruled the country” (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage and birth of son.%} Once Duṣyanta set out
<div n="lb"/>to a forest to hunt. Seated in his chariot, which moved
<div n="lb"/>with the speed of Garuḍa he came to a beautiful forest.
<div n="lb"/>Weary with hunger and thirst the King, leaving the
<div n="lb"/>attendants behind walked into the hermitage of the sage
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva. Proceeding along the sand on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī river and drinking with his eyes the beauties
<div n="lb"/>of the hermitage he reached Kaṇva's āśrama. ‘Who
<div n="lb"/>is there in the āśrama?’ queried the King, whereupon
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā, the foster daughter of Kaṇva came out, and
<div n="lb"/>in the absence of her father welcomed the guest.
<div n="lb"/>Enchanted by the beauty of Śakuntalā, the King
<div n="lb"/>questioned her about her lineage and she told him the
<div n="lb"/>story about Viśvāmitra's love for Menakā, and Kaṇva
<div n="lb"/>bringing up their daughter. Duṣyanta felt deep love
<div n="lb"/>for her, and in accordance with rules prescribed in
<div n="lb"/>Dharma śāstras married her in the Gāndharva way. He
<div n="lb"/>also accepted her stipulation that the son born to her
<div n="lb"/>should become the next monarch. Śakuntalā got preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant, and after promising that she would duly be
<div n="lb"/>conducted to the palace Duṣyanta returned.
<div n="NI"/>No sooner had Duṣyanta left the āśrama than Kaṇva,
<div n="lb"/>who had been out returned to the āśrama. With his
<div n="lb"/>divine eyes he understood what had happened in his
<div n="lb"/>absence. Kaṇva blessed Śakuntalā that she would have
<div n="lb"/>an excellent son, who would become an excellent
<div n="lb"/>ruler of the world surrounded by the sea.
<div n="NI"/>In due course of time Śakuntalā delivered a son. Kaṇva
<div n="lb"/>did the rites pertaining to the birth of the child, and
<div n="lb"/>named the child Sarvadamana. The child grew up to
<div n="lb"/>become six years old, and Kaṇva realising that the
<div n="lb"/>further stay of Śakuntalā and her son at the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>would stand in the way of the child's welfare and pro-
<div n="lb"/>gress sent the mother and the child to Hastināpura,
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Duṣyanta, attended by his disciples.
<div n="lb"/>When they reached Duṣyanta's palace and sent word to
<div n="lb"/>him about their arrival he, pleading ignorance about
<div n="lb"/>his marriage with Śakuntalā, refused to receive her and
<div n="lb"/>the child. Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā hotly argued the
<div n="lb"/>question. At last, when Śakuntalā, with swelling
<div n="lb"/>emotions was about to leave the palace, a celestial voice
<div n="lb"/>announced that Duṣyanta had, in fact, married
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā, that Sarvadamana was his son and that he
<div n="lb"/>(Sarvadamana) would become a great ruler under the
<div n="lb"/>name Bharata. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 69-74).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%} (1) Duṣyanta did not eat flesh.
<div n="lb"/>(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 115, Verse 64).
<div n="NI"/>(2) After his death Duṣyanta stayed in Yama's assembly
<div n="lb"/>worshipping him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 15).
