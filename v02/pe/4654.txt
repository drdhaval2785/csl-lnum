NĀḌĪCAKRA¦. The ten nāḍīs where the yogī in medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion retains the five prāṇas form the nāḍicakra.
<div n="NI"/>At the bottom of the nābhi (nābhīkanda) innumerable
<div n="lb"/>nāḍīs or nerves originate or sprout up. 72,000 such
<div n="lb"/>nāḍīs exist at the centre of the nābhi (navel). The whole
<div n="lb"/>body is filled with these nāḍīs spread out in parallel and
<div n="lb"/>horizontal positions, and they exist in the form of
<div n="lb"/>circles entwined with one another. Ten nāḍīs are promi-
<div n="lb"/>nent amongst them, i.e. Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣumnā,
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī, Hastijihvā, Pṛthā, Yaśā, Alambuṣā, Kuhā
<div n="lb"/>and Śaṅkhinī. Any defect or harm caused to any one
<div n="lb"/>of these ten nāḍīs may lead even to death.
<div n="NI"/>There are ten Vāyus (winds) in the body. The five Prāṇas
<div n="lb"/>called Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna. Udāna and Vyāna, and
<div n="lb"/>the five Vāyus called Nāga, Kūrma, Kṛkala, Devadatta
<div n="lb"/>and Dhanañjaya together constitute the ten Vāyus.
<div n="lb"/>Prāṇa is the most important Vāyu. This vāyu does the
<div n="lb"/>emptying as well as the refilling of the other nine vāyus
<div n="lb"/>and thus sustains life. The prāṇavāyu has its existence
<div n="lb"/>ever in the chest of living beings and fills the body
<div n="lb"/>with air through breathing in, out, coughing etc. It
<div n="lb"/>depends on life and it is called Prāṇavāyu as it moves
<div n="lb"/>or travels with life.
<div n="NI"/>Apāna leads vāyu downwards. It is Apāna which directs
<div n="lb"/>man's food downwards. Also it keeps in its fold urine
<div n="lb"/>and semen. This vāyu is called Apāna as its function is
<div n="lb"/>adhonayana (leading downwards) as mentioned above.
<div n="lb"/>Samānavāyu conveys to the different parts in the body
<div n="lb"/>in equal manner the things which living beings eat,
<div n="lb"/>drink and smell as also blood, bile, phlegm and vāta.
<div n="lb"/>Udāna causes the shivering of lips, flushing of face and
<div n="lb"/>eyes and excitement of joints etc. Vyāna causes the
<div n="lb"/>limbs to be closed and stretched, and it excites diseases.
<div n="lb"/>Nāga exists in nausea, Kūrma in the bulging of the eyes
[Page513-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛkala in food, Devadatta in yawning and Dhanañjaya
<div n="lb"/>in sound. Dhanañjaya does not quit the body even after
<div n="lb"/>death.
<div n="NI"/>Life, Prāṇa, travels through the nāḍīcakra depending on
<div n="lb"/>ten different courses, i.e. Saṅkrānti, Viṣuva, Ahar,
<div n="lb"/>Rātri, the two ayanas (Dakṣiṇa and Uttara), Adhivāsa
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṇa, Ūnarātra and Dhana. Ūnarātra means hiccough,
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṇa cough, Dhana breathing and Adhivāsa yawning.
<div n="lb"/>Of the two ayanas, Uttara and Dakṣiṇa, the former is
<div n="lb"/>the course towards the left and the latter towards the
<div n="lb"/>right and Viṣuva is the centre between the two.
<div n="lb"/>Saṅkrānti is the change of position of Viṣuva. On he
<div n="lb"/>left side of the human body is the nāḍī called Iḍā, on
<div n="lb"/>the right side Piṅgalā and between the two Suṣumnā.
<div n="lb"/>The prāṇa above these three nāḍīs is Ahar i.e. day and
<div n="lb"/>that below is Apāna, i.e. night. Thus every vāyu assumes
<div n="lb"/>ten different forms.
<div n="NI"/>There are various kinds of prāṇāyāma (control of
<div n="lb"/>breaths). Prāṇāyāma practised with the prāṇa contained
<div n="lb"/>in the centre of the body is called Candragrahaṇa;
<div n="lb"/>that which supersedes physical principles is called
<div n="lb"/>Sūryagrahaṇa. To fill the stomach with as much of vāyu
<div n="lb"/>as is desired is Pūrakaprāṇāyāma. To remain like a full
<div n="lb"/>pot, all breathing stopped, (Pot completely filled)
<div n="lb"/>having closed all the openings—‘doors’—of the body is
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhaka. The yogī practising Kumbhaka should
<div n="lb"/>direct the vāyu upwards in one breath, and that practice
<div n="lb"/>is called Recaka. He who does it should be conversant
<div n="lb"/>with the yoga of inhalation. Erudite people call it
<div n="lb"/>Japa, because when it is practised Śiva resident in one's
<div n="lb"/>own body awakes within. Śiva, the King of yogins,
<div n="lb"/>chants the mantra (japa) 21,6000 times within the course
<div n="lb"/>of one day and one night. The soul chants the mantra—
<div n="lb"/>Gāyatrī—of which Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva are the pre-
<div n="lb"/>siding deities, and that is called Ajapa. He who chants
<div n="lb"/>Ajapa will have no future births. Prāṇāyāma should be
<div n="lb"/>followed by Kuṇḍalinīyoga, Kuṇḍalinī meaning primor-
<div n="lb"/>dial force. The force is a compound of Sun, fire and
<div n="lb"/>Moon and its seat is the heart, where it exists in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a sprout. Since creation is dependent upon this force
<div n="lb"/>power for creation should be invoked on it. The yogin
<div n="lb"/>should picture in his mind that nectar flows out of
<div n="lb"/>Kuṇḍalinī. He should also realise that the soul within
<div n="lb"/>the body possesses form while pure soul is formless. He
<div n="lb"/>should address this soul as ‘Haṃsa Haṃsa’. Haṃsa
<div n="lb"/>means Śiva. Śiva exists and functions inside and outside
<div n="lb"/>the body just as oil is in the gingelly seed and fragrance
<div n="lb"/>in flower. Soul possessing form is of five kinds. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Brahmā's seat is the heart, Viṣṇu's the neck,
<div n="lb"/>Rudra's, the centre of the throat; Maheśvara's the
<div n="lb"/>forehead; and Śiva's, the tip of the prāṇa. Soul without
<div n="lb"/>form is just contrary to the above. Its place is where
<div n="lb"/>the prāṇa ends. By prāṇāyāma the formless soul may
<div n="lb"/>be experienced. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 214).
