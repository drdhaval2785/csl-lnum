EKALAVYA I¦. Son of Hiraṇyadhanus, a King of the
<div n="lb"/>foresters. He went to Droṇācārya to learn archery.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇācārya refused to accept him as a disciple because
<div n="lb"/>he was a Śūdra. Undaunted he went to the forests,
<div n="lb"/>made a replica of the preceptor in clay and standing
<div n="lb"/>before it started practising archery. Soon he became a
<div n="lb"/>matchless archer.
<div n="NI"/>Some time later the Pāṇḍavas went to the forests for
<div n="lb"/>hunting. One of the hunting dogs wandering saw
<div n="lb"/>Ekalavya and started barking. Ekalavya sent seven
<div n="lb"/>arrows to its mouth and kept it open. When the dog
<div n="lb"/>returned to Arjuna he was dumbfounded at the skill
<div n="lb"/>of the archer and when he came to know the archer
<div n="lb"/>was an unknown disciple of Droṇa his disappointment
<div n="lb"/>knew no bounds. Droṇa had once declared that Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>was the best and topmost of his disciples. Arjuna went
<div n="lb"/>and complained to Droṇācārya. Droṇācārya called
<div n="lb"/>Ekalavya to his side and asked him to give him as
<div n="lb"/>‘Gurudakṣiṇā’ (fee to the preceptor) his right-hand
<div n="lb"/>thumb. Without the least hesitation Ekalavya offered
<div n="lb"/>his thumb to the guru and from that day onwards his
<div n="lb"/>skill faded and he became inferior to Arjuna. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>132, Ādi Parva): Ekalavya was killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 77, Chapter 48, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>A son of Ekalavya seized the sacrificial horse of Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and was killed by Arjuna (Chapter 83, Āśvamedhika
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
