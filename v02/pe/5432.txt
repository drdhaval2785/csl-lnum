PṚTHU II¦. A virtuous brahmin of good conduct.
<div n="lb"/>Once when Pṛthu was travelling he met five ugly
<div n="lb"/>devils. They became devils for their sins of not doing
<div n="lb"/>any charity and behaving rudely with beggars. Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>gave them advice on āhāra (food), ācāra (conduct)
<div n="lb"/>and vrata (vow) so that they might get salvation from
<div n="lb"/>their devil-lives. (Chapter 27, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
