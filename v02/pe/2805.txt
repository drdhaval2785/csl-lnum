JĀBĀLI I¦. A famous hermit. In Mahābhārata, Anu-
<div n="lb"/>śāsana Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 55, it is stated that
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli was one of the sons of Viśvāmitra. They
<div n="lb"/>were expounders of the Vedas. Though he was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvāmitra his life was mostly connected with Va-
<div n="lb"/>siṣṭha. The Purāṇas do not make it clear how this son
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvāmitra happened to fall into the circle of Vasi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭha who was a foe of Viśvāmitra. He was one of the
<div n="lb"/>seven spiritual advisers of King Daśaratha. It is men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 48 that
<div n="lb"/>eight hermits such as Suyajña, Vāmadeva, Jābāli,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa Vasiṣṭha and others lived in Ayodhyā in the
<div n="lb"/>palace of the King Daśaratha.
<div n="NI"/>When Bharata went to the forest, to bring Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>back to Ayodhyā, Jābāli also followed him. Jābāli
<div n="lb"/>argued with Śrī Rāma, using several arguments, to make
<div n="lb"/>him return to Ayodhyā. These arguments made Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma angry. But he was pacified by the consoling words
<div n="lb"/>of Vasiṣṭha. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Jābāli comes in the line of disciples of Vyāsa. Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>divided the Veda and taught Sumantu Atharvaveda.
<div n="lb"/>The hermit Sumantu first taught Atharvaveda to his
<div n="lb"/>disciple Kabandha who divided it into two parts and
<div n="lb"/>taught two disciples Devadarśa, and Pathya. The disci-
[Page335-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ples of Devadarśa were Magadha, Brahmabali, Saut-
<div n="lb"/>kāyani and Pippalāda. Pathya had three disciples.
<div n="lb"/>They were Jābāli, Kumuda and Śaunaka. Of these
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli was a famous expounder of Atharvaveda. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3).
