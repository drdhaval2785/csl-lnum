ĀRYAS¦. The Ṛgveda gives us most of the information
<div n="lb"/>regarding the Āryas who came to the north of India
<div n="lb"/>during the times of the Vedas through the passes on
<div n="lb"/>that north-western side of Bhārata. Sirdar K.M. Panikar
<div n="lb"/>writing in his preface to the ‘Ṛgvedasaṃhitā’ by Poet
<div n="lb"/>Vallathol summarises the information available in the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda about Āryan culture and says: “When the
<div n="lb"/>Āryans first entered India they were rich in
<div n="lb"/>cattle. They used to breed goats, dogs, donkeys, and
<div n="lb"/>horses. The elephant was unknown to them. In the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas the vehicle of Ind a is a horse and not an eleph-
<div n="lb"/>ant. When hailing Indra they shout ‘come, come on
<div n="lb"/>your horse-back’. The Veda does not say anything
<div n="lb"/>about how Indra got the elephant, Airāvata, as his
<div n="lb"/>vehicle. Sing to the glory of Indra against whom in
<div n="lb"/>his chariot driven by two horses no enemy would dare
<div n="lb"/>to face.
<div n="NI"/>The Ṛgveda gives great importance to agriculture.
<div n="lb"/>Areas under cultivation were called Urvara and
<div n="lb"/>‘Kṣetra’. Fields were ploughed by attaching six, eight
<div n="lb"/>and even twelve bullocks to the plough. Water was taken
<div n="lb"/>from hṛadas and Kulyakas (ponds and tanks) for the
<div n="lb"/>purpose of irrigation. Agriculture was a very familiar
<div n="lb"/>art to them. They used to cultivate all sorts of grains
<div n="lb"/>and grams including yava. They conducted trade by
<div n="lb"/>the exchange of goods generally. There is a reference
<div n="lb"/>in one place of the use of a coin ‘Niṣka’
<div n="NI"/>The Āryas were clever in the art of leather work, wood-
<div n="lb"/>work and metallurgy. They were well versed in medi-
<div n="lb"/>cine also. In a sūkta of the ninth maṇḍala it is stated
<div n="lb"/>that the father of a ṛṣi was a medical practitioner.
<div n="lb"/>There are references to many industries also. Weav-
<div n="lb"/>ing was a very important industry at that time. Cotton
<div n="lb"/>cloth and woollen blankets were made by them on a
<div n="lb"/>large scale. Iron was used by them with great skill.
<div n="lb"/>The manufacture of armours and the descriptions about
<div n="lb"/>them in Ṛgveda are ample evidence of the proficiency
<div n="lb"/>of the Āryas in ironmongery and blacksmithing. Sea
<div n="lb"/>voyage was not familiar to them. References to traders
<div n="lb"/>cruising in boats in the Sindhu river do not give much
<div n="lb"/>importance to the cruising. In food rice and ghee were
<div n="lb"/>important. Meat was also relished. Rṣis wore animal
<div n="lb"/>skins but others wore dhotis and shawls.
<div n="NI"/>During the Ṛgvedic times their social structure was
<div n="lb"/>divided into four stages: Grāma was a colony of fami-
<div n="lb"/>lies and was the nucleus of the society. A number of
<div n="lb"/>gramas formed into a place called Viṣaya. A number
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣayas became what was known as ‘Janam’. The
<div n="lb"/>importance of Janas can be understood by the state-
[Page091-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ments made about Pañcajanas and the existence of
<div n="lb"/>special Janas like Yādava Jana and Bhārata Jana.
<div n="NI"/>There is no wonder why the Āryas who had to live among
<div n="lb"/>enemies accepted kingship. The Ṛgveda narrates the
<div n="lb"/>difficulties people would have to encounter if they were
<div n="lb"/>left to fight their enemies without a proper leader and
<div n="lb"/>so advocates Kingship and gives it an exalted position
<div n="lb"/>in their social structure. Sūkta 22, Anuvāka 12 of
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala 10 describes the coronation of a King thus:
<div n="lb"/>“I do hereby crown you as King. Come to our midst.
<div n="lb"/>Rule us with courage and an unwavering mind. Let
<div n="lb"/>all your subjects love you. Let thy kingdom remain
<div n="lb"/>with you for ever”. The next mantra is also of the
<div n="lb"/>same idea. A King is above punishment. The veda
<div n="lb"/>speaks about many famous kings of which the following
<div n="lb"/>are worth mentioning. Divodāsa, Sudās, Ambarīṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa and Purūravas.
<div n="NI"/>The chief priest was always the political advisor also.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha were two great priests of the
<div n="lb"/>Bharata dynasty. There were other priests also. Men-
<div n="lb"/>tion is there about a Rājasabhā though nothing is said
<div n="lb"/>about their powers or functions. It can be surmised
<div n="lb"/>that the Sabhā was constituted of only men of character
<div n="lb"/>and learning.
<div n="NI"/>It is interesting to note the type of domestic life in
<div n="lb"/>vogue then. A father had the right, to sell his children,
<div n="lb"/>To cite an example is the story of Śunaśśepha who was
<div n="lb"/>made into a cow and sold to Viśvāmitra who looked
<div n="lb"/>after him well. The father had the right to make his
<div n="lb"/>children lose all rights over his properties. Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>sent out from his family fifty sons who refused to obey
<div n="lb"/>him. Dowry was current then. Sūkta 11, Anuvāka 3,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍalam 10 ordains that the bride should go to the
<div n="lb"/>house of her husband after the marriage. Polygamy was
<div n="lb"/>not objected to. There is a mantra to harass the co-wife
<div n="lb"/>and its purpose is to make the husband more attached
<div n="lb"/>to her who hates the co-wife. The originator of this
<div n="lb"/>mantra was Indrāṇī, the queen of Indra. Indra had
<div n="lb"/>many wives. Marriage was considered as a necessary
<div n="lb"/>duty. Widow marriage was allowed.
<div n="NI"/>The Ṛgveda gives the picture of a society of people
<div n="lb"/>who were always at war with each other. “We are
<div n="lb"/>surrounded by mighty enemies. Help us”. This is the
<div n="lb"/>slogan that rings out from the Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>The Ṛgveda is a history of the Āryas. The march from
<div n="lb"/>Kubhātaṭa (Kubul) to the banks of Yamunā is depict-
<div n="lb"/>ed there. It was at Kubhātaṭa that the mantras were
<div n="lb"/>first made. When they reach the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>the period of Ṛgveda ends. The crossing of each of
<div n="lb"/>the five rivers of Pañcanada is treated as a big event
<div n="lb"/>by the ṛṣis. When they saw the huge and deep river,
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu, they were amazed. The wonder is reflected in a
<div n="lb"/>lovely mantra. It was after crossing Sindhu that they had
<div n="lb"/>to oppose the ‘Dasyus’. The Ṛgveda itself records that
<div n="lb"/>the Dasyus were more cultured than the Āryas. Śam-
<div n="lb"/>bara, a Dasyu King, was the ruler of a hundred cities.
<div n="lb"/>Their fortresses were strong. They have been described
<div n="lb"/>in the Ṛgveda as Aśvamayī, Āyasī and Śatabhujī.
<div n="NI"/>The chief opponents of the Āryas were a tribe of people
<div n="lb"/>called Paṇis. From the Nirukta of Yāska we are given
<div n="lb"/>to understand that the Paṇis were mainly engaged in
<div n="lb"/>trade. The Ṛgveda names many Dasyu kings of which
<div n="lb"/>the following few were more daring and brave and the
<div n="lb"/>Āryas acknowledged their superior strength and courage:
<div n="lb"/>Dhuni, Cumuri, Vipru, Varcis and Śambara. Among
[Page092-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the several divisions of the Dasyus, the Śimyus, Kīkaṭas,
<div n="lb"/>Śigrus and Yakṣus ranked foremost in power. They are
<div n="lb"/>described as having black colour and flat noses and
<div n="lb"/>speaking a language different from that of the Āryas.
<div n="lb"/>We may surmise from these facts that they belonged
<div n="lb"/>to the Drāviḍa class of people. They never conducted
<div n="lb"/>yāga nor did they worship gods like Indra. They were
<div n="lb"/>idol worshippers for they have been abused as ‘Śiśna-
<div n="lb"/>devas’. Later the Āryas learnt from the Dasyus the
<div n="lb"/>worship of Śiva, Devī and Liṅga.
<div n="NI"/>Conquering these daring and cultured enemies the
<div n="lb"/>Āryas reached the banks of the Yamunā to find to their
<div n="lb"/>pleasant surprise a radical change in themselves. The
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas settled themselves in the land between the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā and Gaṅgā and remained friendly with the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyus living to the east of Gaṅgā. The Āryas who
<div n="lb"/>settled down in Pañcanada were strong and to prevent
<div n="lb"/>them from coming and conquering them Bharata tried
<div n="lb"/>to keep them remain on the other side of Śutudri
<div n="lb"/>(Sutlej). This led to a war called Dāśarājña.
<div n="NI"/>This war is to be considered as one of the most impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant of wars in the world. Those who opposed Sudās
<div n="lb"/>were Āryas though among the supporters of Sudās were
<div n="lb"/>also Āryas. It was the people under Sudās who came
<div n="lb"/>out victorious in that war and put a stop to further
<div n="lb"/>conquests by the Āryas. From thereafter the Āryas
<div n="lb"/>joined hands with the aborigines and laid the foundation
<div n="lb"/>for the great Hindu civilization. Thereafter the Ṛgveda
<div n="lb"/>states about prayers for help to combat ‘our enemies
<div n="lb"/>of Āryas and Dasyus’. The gods who were recognised
<div n="lb"/>later were those who were not found in the vedas of
<div n="lb"/>the Āryas. The worship of Mahāyogī and Devī found
<div n="lb"/>in Mohenjodaro is an evidence of this change.
