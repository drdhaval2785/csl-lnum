PṚŚNIGARBHA¦. A name of Mahāviṣṇu. There are
<div n="lb"/>two opinions in the Purāṇas regarding how Viṣṇu got
<div n="lb"/>this name.
<div n="NI"/>1) In the early part of the period of Svāyambhuva
<div n="lb"/>Manu the Prajāpati named Sutapas and his wife Pṛśni
<div n="lb"/>did penance for twelve thousand divine years to get
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu as their son. As a result of that Viṣṇu was born
<div n="lb"/>in the womb of Pṛśni as Pṛśnigarbha. The name was
<div n="lb"/>suited for Śrī Kṛṣṇa the incarnation of Viṣṇu also.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 3, 10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) Anna (rice), Veda, Jala (water) and amṛta (nectar)
<div n="lb"/>are called Pṛśni and so Mahāviṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa) who bears
<div n="lb"/>these inside is called Pṛśnigarbha. (Śloka 45, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>342, Śānti Parva).
