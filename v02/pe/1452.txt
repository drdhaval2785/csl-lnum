CANDRAŚEKHARA¦. A King (son of Pauṣya). The
<div n="lb"/>following story about his birth is told in the Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Though married for a long time Pauṣya did not have an
<div n="lb"/>issue. He began worshipping Śiva to be blessed with a
<div n="lb"/>son. Śiva was pleased at this and he gave him a fruit
<div n="lb"/>which he divided equally among his three wives. In
<div n="lb"/>due course the three wives delivered. But, to get the
<div n="lb"/>full and complete form of a child the three children had to
<div n="lb"/>be joined together, and so the parts were unified. This
<div n="lb"/>boy was Candraśekhara. Thus Candraśekhara acquired
<div n="lb"/>the name Tryaṃbaka.
<div n="NI"/>Candraśekhara married Tārāvatī, daughter of Kaku-
<div n="lb"/>tstha, a King of the solar dynasty. On account of the
<div n="lb"/>curse of Kapotamuni two sons, Bhṛṅgi and Mahākāla
<div n="lb"/>were born to Tārāvatī in Vetāla yoni and Bhairava
<div n="lb"/>yoni respectively. Dama, Uparicara and Alarka were
<div n="lb"/>sons born to Candraśekhara himself. (Aurasaputras).
