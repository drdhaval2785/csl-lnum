ŚAṆḌHĀMARKA¦. The two ṛṣis called Śaṇḍha and
<div n="lb"/>Marka, who were priests of the asuras and whose
<div n="lb"/>presence made them invincible. The Devas enticed the
<div n="lb"/>two priests to their side by offering them Soma and
<div n="lb"/>thus rendered the asuras powerless. When the Devas
<div n="lb"/>after some time, began a yajña, Śaṇḍha and Marka
<div n="lb"/>approached them for the promised Soma, but the Devas
<div n="lb"/>did not keep their word, and the disillusioned Śaṇḍhamar-
<div n="lb"/>kas were driven out of the yājñic hall. (Taittirīyasaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>hitā, 6, 4, 10).
