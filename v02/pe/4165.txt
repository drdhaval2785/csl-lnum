MAHĀTALA¦. A section of Pātāla. The descendants of
<div n="lb"/>the serpent Kadrū live here. These serpents are many-
<div n="lb"/>headed and terrible monsters. Chief among them are
<div n="lb"/>Kahaka, Takṣaka, Suṣeṇa, Kāliya and others. All these
<div n="lb"/>serpents have long and slender bodies, large hoods and
<div n="lb"/>are of very cruel nature. Still they are all afraid of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa and so live quietly with their families in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>tala. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha).
