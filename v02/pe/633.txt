AUŚANAS¦ (Kapālamocana). A holy place on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river, Sarasvatī. Brahmā, the devas and
<div n="lb"/>many maharṣis lived here once. (Chapter 83, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>This place is called Kapālamocana also. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story behind the place getting this name.
<div n="NI"/>At the forest of Daṇḍaka Śrī Rāma killed many demons.
<div n="lb"/>The force of the arrows took the skulls of the demons
<div n="lb"/>to far off places in the forest. One of the skulls thus
<div n="lb"/>sent far fell on the feet of a sage named Mahodara
<div n="lb"/>who was then going that way. The skull went deep
<div n="lb"/>into his foot and not only did it wound his foot
<div n="lb"/>but it stuck to his foot so hard that it could not
<div n="lb"/>be drawn out also. With his foot in pains the sage
<div n="lb"/>visited all the holy places but with no relief to his pain.
<div n="lb"/>At last Mahodara came to Auśanasa and to his surprise
<div n="lb"/>the skull came off from his foot healing his wound. He
<div n="lb"/>remained there for some time and obtained many divine
<div n="lb"/>attainments. From then onwards the place was called
<div n="lb"/>‘Kapālamocana’. After this incident Brahmā, Viśvāmitra,
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadrarāma and many such divine persons visited
<div n="lb"/>the place. (Chapter 39, Śalya Parva, M.B.)
