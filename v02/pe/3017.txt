JVARA¦. (Jvaram) (Fever).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A fearful being. It is stated in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas that living beings catch fever owing to the
<div n="lb"/>activities of this monster.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The origin of jvara.%} Once Śiva and Pārvatī were
<div n="lb"/>talking with each other in the Holy Bath called Jyotiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>kam on mount Mahāmeru. On that day Dakṣa had
<div n="lb"/>performed a sacrifice at Gaṅgādvāra. Śiva alone was
<div n="lb"/>not invited. Seeing the Gods Brahmā and the others
<div n="lb"/>going to that place through the sky, Pārvatī asked Śiva
<div n="lb"/>what the matter was. Śiva explained everything to
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī, who became very sorry because her husband
<div n="lb"/>had not been invited. Śiva grew uneasy at the sorrow
<div n="lb"/>of his wife. A drop of sweat fell down from his third
<div n="lb"/>eye. A fearful monster with the lustre of fire arose
<div n="lb"/>from that drop of sweat. That figure is described as
<div n="lb"/>follows:
<div n="NI"/>“A terrible monster, with dwarfish figure, staring eyes,
<div n="lb"/>green moustaches, hair standing erect on head and
<div n="lb"/>body covered with hair all over, looking like a combi-
<div n="lb"/>nation of hawk and owl, with jet-black colour, wearing
<div n="lb"/>a blood-coloured cloth.” (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 283).
<div n="NI"/>“With three legs, three heads, six hands and nine eyes,
<div n="lb"/>comes Jvara the terrible monster, as fierce as Yama
<div n="lb"/>the god of death and fearful like a thousand clouds with
<div n="lb"/>thunderbolt, gaping and sighing, with tight body and
<div n="lb"/>horrible face, rendered so by many eyes.” (M.B. Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 122).
<div n="NI"/>To this uncouth figure Śiva gave the name Jvara, who
<div n="lb"/>dashed away and entered into all devas (gods). Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and the others caught fever and were laid up. At last
<div n="lb"/>they all came to Śiva. Hearing their request Śiva
<div n="lb"/>divided Jvara into several parts and separated them from
<div n="lb"/>devas and entered them into other living beings, and
<div n="lb"/>ordered that, headache for elephants, green coverings
<div n="lb"/>for water, shedding of skin for snakes, hoof-rot for cows,
<div n="lb"/>sore-throat for horses, feather-sprouting for peacocks,
<div n="lb"/>sore-eye for cuckoo, hiccough for parrot, weariness
<div n="lb"/>for tigers and fever for men will be caused by Jvara.
<div n="NI"/>It was the time of the terrorization of Vṛtrāsura. Jvara
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of that Asura also. It was at this time
<div n="lb"/>that Indra used his thunderbolt and killed Vṛtrāsura.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 283; M.B. Viṣṇu Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 122).
