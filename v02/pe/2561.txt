HAṂSA I¦. An incarnation of Mahā Viṣṇu in Kṛtayuga.
<div n="lb"/>He instructed great sages like Sanaka on yoga in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Brahmā. He is also called yajña. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata 11th Skandha). Hamsa, who was a prajāpati as
<div n="lb"/>well advised the Sādhyadevas about the means to
<div n="lb"/>attain salvation and the advice is known as Haṃsagītā.
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 288).
<div n="NI"/>HAṂSA II. A son born to Kaśyapa of his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Ariṣṭā. He was a Gandharva and it is believed that
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra was an aṃśāvatāra of this Gandharva.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 6, See also under Aṃśā-
<div n="lb"/>vatāṛa).
<div n="NI"/>HAṂSA III.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A minister of Jarāsandha. Haṃsa and
<div n="lb"/>Ḍiṃbhaka were the sons of Brahmadatta, the chief of
<div n="lb"/>Sālva, and they were adepts in archery. Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>was their preceptor. (Harivaṃśa 3, 103). The
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata calls Haṃsa's brother Ḍibhaka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Education.%} Vicakra and Janārdana were intimate
<div n="lb"/>friends of Haṃsa from their very infancy, of whom
<div n="lb"/>Janārdana was the son of Mitrasaha, a friend of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmadatta. Haṃsa, Ḍimbhaka and Janārdana had
<div n="lb"/>their education together and their marriages also were
<div n="lb"/>conducted at the same time. After some time Śiva
<div n="lb"/>presented them many weapons like Rudrāstra, Mahe-
<div n="lb"/>śvarāstra and Brahmaśirāstra, and also two attendants
<div n="lb"/>for self-protection. (Harivaṃśa 3, 105).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Curse of Durvāsas.%} Swollen-headed and haughty on
<div n="lb"/>account of Śiva's boon, Haṃsa and Ḍiṃbhaka turned
<div n="lb"/>out to be a nightmare to the world, and they once
<div n="lb"/>tried to give trouble to Durvāsas, who cursed them to
<div n="lb"/>be killed by Mahāviṣṇu. Sometime later the sage
<div n="lb"/>himself informed Śrī Kṛṣṇa about this curse of his.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} The Haṃsa brothers began an aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>(Horse Sacrifice) and deputed Janārdana to collect
<div n="lb"/>the tax thereof. Śrī Kṛṣṇa alone refused to pay the
<div n="lb"/>tax with the result that Haṃsa clashed with Kṛṣṇa who
<div n="lb"/>killed Ḍimbhaka and kicked Haṃsa down to Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>He died there, in Pātāla of snake-bite. (Harivaṃśa 3,
<div n="lb"/>128).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Grief of Jarāsandha.%} Haṃsa's death caused much
<div n="lb"/>grief to Jarāsandha, and for many years after it, he shed
<div n="lb"/>tears over the death of his friend. Even at the time
<div n="lb"/>when Bhīmasena, during his triumphal tour of the east,
<div n="lb"/>attacked Jarāsandha he remembered the dead Haṃsa
<div n="lb"/>and Ḍimbhaka. (Sabhā Parva, 13, 37).
