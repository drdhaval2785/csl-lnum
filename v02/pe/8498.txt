VIṢṆUDATTA¦. Son of the Brahmin named Vasudatta.
<div n="lb"/>The story of Viṣṇudatta is quoted to prove that bad
<div n="lb"/>omens at the beginning of a journey is a warning that
<div n="lb"/>the journey would not be fruitful and that it would be
<div n="lb"/>rather dangerous.
<div n="NI"/>When Viṣṇudatta became sixteen years old he decided
<div n="lb"/>to go to the city of Valabhī for his education. Seven Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min boys of his age gathered together and joined him.
<div n="lb"/>Deciding not to separate from each other, they started for
<div n="lb"/>Valabhī, without the knowledge of their parents. When
<div n="lb"/>they proceeded a little further they saw a bad omen.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇudatta stood undecided, but the others pressed him
<div n="lb"/>on and they continued their journey. Next day by even-
<div n="lb"/>ing they reached a village of forest tribes. After walking
<div n="lb"/>through the village they reached the house of a woman.
<div n="lb"/>They got her permission to stay there for the night.
<div n="lb"/>They all lay in a corner. Immediately all slept. Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>datta alone lay awake. When the night advanced, a
<div n="lb"/>man entered the house. The woman and the man
<div n="lb"/>talked for a while and carried on sexual sports, and
<div n="lb"/>they lay together and slept. A light was burning in the
<div n="lb"/>room. Viṣṇudatta saw everything through the cleavage
<div n="lb"/>of the shutters, and thought. “I am sorry that we have
<div n="lb"/>come to this house. He is not her husband. Sure! she is
<div n="lb"/>a harlot.” As he was thinking thus, foot-steps were
<div n="lb"/>heard in the courtyard. A young man fixed his
<div n="lb"/>servants in their places. Then he entered the house and
<div n="lb"/>saw Viṣṇudatta and his friends. The new-comer was
<div n="lb"/>also a forest-man. He had a sword in his hand. He was
<div n="lb"/>the owner of the house. Viṣṇudatta said that they were
<div n="lb"/>travellers. When he heard it, without saying anything
<div n="lb"/>he got inside and saw his wife sleeping with her lover.
<div n="lb"/>With the sword in his hand, he cut off the head of the
<div n="lb"/>lover. He did not kill the woman, who did not know
<div n="lb"/>that her lover was killed. The forester laid the sword
<div n="lb"/>down and lay in the same bed and slept. The light was
<div n="lb"/>burning.
<div n="NI"/>After a while the woman woke up, and saw her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band who had cut her lover into two. She stood up
<div n="lb"/>quickly and took the trunk of her lover and placed it
<div n="lb"/>on her shoulder and taking the head in one hand, went
<div n="lb"/>out and hid them in the pile of ashes. Then she return-
<div n="lb"/>ed and lay down. Viṣṇudatta had followed her steal-
<div n="lb"/>thily and seen what she had done. He also returned and
<div n="lb"/>sat in the midst of his friends. She rose up and took the
<div n="lb"/>sword of her husband and killed him with it. Then
<div n="lb"/>coming out she cried aloud. “Oh dear! These travellers
<div n="lb"/>have killed my husband.” The servants woke up and
<div n="lb"/>came to the house and saw their master lying dead.
<div n="lb"/>They tried to attack Viṣṇudatta and his friends.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇudatta told them everything that he had seen, and
<div n="lb"/>showed them the head and the trunk of her lover, hid-
<div n="lb"/>den in the ashes. When they saw this they understood
[Page868-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>everything. They tried the woman. At last she admitted
<div n="lb"/>the crime. They expelled her and drove her away. After
<div n="lb"/>this the travellers returned to their homes. (Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, Taraṅga 6).
