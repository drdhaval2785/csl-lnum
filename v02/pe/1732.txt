DAṆḌĪ II¦. A god. This god is worshipped as a waiter
<div n="lb"/>of the Sun. The sun is consecrated in a chariot of one
<div n="lb"/>wheel, yoked with seven horses, and wearing two lotus
<div n="lb"/>flowers. On the right side of the Sun his waiter Daṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>will be standing as door-keeper with ink and pen in his
<div n="lb"/>hand, and on the left his waiter Piṅgala will be stand-
<div n="lb"/>ing with a stick in his hand. These two gate-keepers
<div n="lb"/>are the two gaṇas of the Sun. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 51).
