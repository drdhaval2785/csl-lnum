VṚKṢAPRATIṢṬHĀ¦. The ancient Indians believed
<div n="lb"/>that consecration of Trees and gardens (parks) were
<div n="lb"/>means of remission of sins and attainment of heaven. As
<div n="lb"/>the consecration of trees is a divine ritual it has to be
<div n="lb"/>performed as ordained in the Vedas. The rites are given
<div n="lb"/>below:
<div n="NI"/>As the first item of the consecration ceremony of a tree,
<div n="lb"/>besmear it with all kinds of medicinal herbs, and adorn
<div n="lb"/>it with flour and flower garlands and make it wear good
<div n="lb"/>clothes. Then make on it perforations for the ears with
<div n="lb"/>golden needle, and anoint ointment for eyes with golden
<div n="lb"/>wire. Place on the dais prepared at the foot of each
<div n="lb"/>tree, seven fruits and pots (Kalaśas) and make invoca-
<div n="lb"/>tions. After this, offerings and sacrifices to Indra and
<div n="lb"/>the other gods should be given. Again invocation
<div n="lb"/>should be made with burnt offerings to Vanaspati. From
<div n="lb"/>the middle of the trees alms of cows should be given.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins should bathe the trees with pots placed on the
<div n="lb"/>dais, reciting spells and incantations of anointment, and
<div n="lb"/>of Ṛg, Yajur and Sāma Vedas along with instrumental
<div n="lb"/>music. The owner of the trees should be given bathing
<div n="lb"/>water by himself. Then the owner should give cows,
<div n="lb"/>lands, ornaments and clothes as gift.
<div n="NI"/>After having done so much, food with milk should be
<div n="lb"/>given for four days and burnt offerings should be made
<div n="lb"/>with gingelly etc. and butea. The gift to the priest
<div n="lb"/>should be double the gifts given to others. (Agni Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 70).
