ŚVETAKETU¦. A Maharṣi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Śvetaketu was the son of the sage Āruṇi or
<div n="lb"/>Uddālaka who was born in the Gautama clan. Śveta-
<div n="lb"/>ketu had a sister named Sujātā. Aṣṭāvakra was her son
<div n="lb"/>by the sage, Kahoṭaka. Thus Śvetaketu was Aṣṭāvakra's
<div n="lb"/>uncle. Śvetaketu and Aṣṭāvakra grew up together in
<div n="lb"/>Uddālaka's āśrama. (See under Aṣṭāvakra).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pride perishes.%} Under his father's training Śveta-
<div n="lb"/>ketu became a great scholar. With the increase in his
<div n="lb"/>scholarship, he became very proud. The father who
<div n="lb"/>understood this called him to his side and asked him:-
<div n="lb"/>“By studying all about what you can see, hear and
<div n="lb"/>understand, have you learnt anything about what you
<div n="lb"/>cannot see, hear or understand?” Śvetaketu admitted
<div n="lb"/>that he did not know. Then Uddālaka explained to
<div n="lb"/>him the mystery of Paramātmā (universal soul) which
<div n="lb"/>is without beginning or end. (Chāndogyopaniṣad).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śvetaketu in Pāñcāla.%} After completing his education
<div n="lb"/>under his father, Śvetaketu went to Pāñcāla. There, in
<div n="lb"/>the royal assembly Jaivali, the Pravāhaṇa King asked
<div n="lb"/>him the following questions:—“Where do people go
<div n="lb"/>from this world? How do they return? Where do
<div n="lb"/>Devayāna and Pitṛyāna meet? From where do they
<div n="lb"/>diverge? Why is Pitṛloka imperfect? What is the fifth
<div n="lb"/>yajñabali?”
<div n="NI"/>Śvetaketu answered that he did not know because his
<div n="lb"/>father had not taught him these things. Then he went
<div n="lb"/>to his father Āruṇi and told him about his failure to
<div n="lb"/>answer these questions. The father admitted that he
<div n="lb"/>too did not know them and suggested that they should
<div n="lb"/>ask Pravāhaṇa himself. Since Śvetaketu refused to go
<div n="lb"/>with him to see the King, Uddālaka himself went to
<div n="lb"/>Prāvahaṇa. The King enlightened him on the above
<div n="lb"/>topics and sent him back. (Chāndogyopaniṣad 1. 8).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ācārya of Yajña Rules.%} In Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Śvetaketu is described as the Ācārya of the rules of
<div n="lb"/>Yajña. He has laid down definite rules and procedures
<div n="lb"/>for priests officiating in Yajñas. Besides, he has suggested
<div n="lb"/>the different customs and practices to be observed by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmacārins and tapasvins. In the treatises dealing with
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaśāstra before his time, food of sweet taste was
<div n="lb"/>denied to Brahmacārins. But Śvetaketu has pointed
<div n="lb"/>out that it was an entirely wrong doctrine. (Gopatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, 1. 33; Sāṃkhyāyana Brāhmaṇa, 1. 33).
<div n="NI"/>Once an ācārya named Jātūkaṛṇya became the priest
<div n="lb"/>of the Kings of Kāśī, Kosala and Videha. Śvetaketu
<div n="lb"/>who was angry at this complained bitterly about this
<div n="lb"/>to his father. Then Uddālaka reminded his son that
<div n="lb"/>priests should yearn for wisdom instead of being
<div n="lb"/>attracted by worldly pleasures.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Author of Kāmaśāstra.%} It is more or less clear that
<div n="lb"/>it was Śvetaketu who abridged the original work on
<div n="lb"/>Kāmaśāstra by Nandi, into 500 chapters. This abridge-
<div n="lb"/>ment of Śvetaketu was again abridged after some years
<div n="lb"/>by Bābhravya. It was after abridging it again and
<div n="lb"/>adding Dattakācārya's “Vaiśika” and Suvarṇanābha's
<div n="lb"/>“Sāmprayogika” etc., that Vātsyāyana composed his
<div n="lb"/>famous treatise “Kāmasūtra”. Really speaking, the
<div n="lb"/>basis of Vātsyāyana's “Kāmasūtra” was the works of
<div n="lb"/>Bābhravya and Śvetaketu on Kāmaśāstra.
<div n="NI"/>It has been observed that the first person who raised
<div n="lb"/>his voice against the evils of drinking and adultery by
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa community was Śvetaketu. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story in the Mahābhārata about the fact which prompt-
<div n="lb"/>ed him to bring marriage within the framework of law.
<div n="lb"/>Śvetaketu was Uddālaka's son, born to his wife by one
<div n="lb"/>of his disciples. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 35, Verse
<div n="lb"/>22). Once his mother was abducted by a Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>This incident inspired him to make stringent laws
<div n="lb"/>insisting on monogamy for men and women.
