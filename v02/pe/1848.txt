DEVARĀJA II¦. An immoral brahmin who had been a
<div n="lb"/>trader in Kirātanagara. Once he met a whore at the
<div n="lb"/>bathing pool and got so inextricably tied up with her
<div n="lb"/>that he killed his parents and wife for her sake. Then
<div n="lb"/>one day he had to go to Pratiṣṭhānanagara on business
<div n="lb"/>where he heard sacred stories being read. He had also
<div n="lb"/>a glimpse of the divine. A month after that he died.
<div n="lb"/>Though an evil fellow, because of his having worshipped
<div n="lb"/>Śiva for a month he had the good fortune to go to Mount
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa after his death. (Śiva Purāṇa Māhātmyam).
