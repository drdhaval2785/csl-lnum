<div n="lb"/>Facts about Sahadeva are related under the headings,
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra, Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula and Pāṇḍavas.
[Page663-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Only those facts, which have not been so related are
<div n="lb"/>given hereunder.)
<div n="NI"/>1) {%A brief biographical sketch.%} Sahadeva was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu by his wife Mādrī. Two sons, Nakula and
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva were born to Mādrī by the Aśvinīdevas.
<div n="lb"/>Along with Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma and Arjuna, sons of
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī, Nakula and Sahadeva spent their childhood in
<div n="lb"/>the company of Sages at Śataśṛṅga mountain. Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>died and Mādrī followed him in the funeral pyre. After
<div n="lb"/>that the Pāṇḍavas lived at Hastināpura under the care
<div n="lb"/>of Kuntī. When the ‘lac-palace’ was burnt down, they
<div n="lb"/>took themselves to the forest and ruled the kingdom
<div n="lb"/>with Indraprastha as capital. The Pāṇḍavas, who
<div n="lb"/>were defeated in the game of dice went again into
<div n="lb"/>the forest. Their going into the forest has been des-
<div n="lb"/>cribed as follows by Vidura.
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira, covering his face with cloth and Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>stretching out his powerful hands moved into the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Arjuna followed them throwing up sand par-
<div n="lb"/>ticles. Sahadeva went rubbing his face with earth,
<div n="lb"/>Nakula, the most handsome of men, followed them,
<div n="lb"/>his body smeared with dust. Pāñcālī, her face con-
<div n="lb"/>cealed in hair and weeping went behind the king. Sage
<div n="lb"/>Dhaumya with Kuśa grass in his hands, accompanied
<div n="lb"/>them chanting Vedic hymns. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>80).
<div n="NI"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Vidura why the Pāṇḍavas assumed
<div n="lb"/>these different poses and attitudes and Vidura answered
<div n="lb"/>him thus: Yudhiṣṭhira covered his face to show that
<div n="lb"/>he would not retaliate in anger though he had lost the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom due to cheating. Bhīma stretched out his
<div n="lb"/>hands to show that he was unrivalled in manual power.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna threw out sand to say that he would shoot his
<div n="lb"/>arrows into the enemy camp like particles of sand.
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva rubbed earth on his face as he did not want
<div n="lb"/>anybody to distinguish his face. Nakula, the most
<div n="lb"/>handsome of men, smeared his face with dust so that,
<div n="lb"/>on the way, women should not desire him.
<div n="NI"/>When the Pāṇḍavas returned after twelve years' stay in
<div n="lb"/>exile in the forest and one year's stay incognito
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana refused to allot them even a single house,
<div n="lb"/>and war for eighteen days between the Kauravas and
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas was fought in the field of Kurukṣetra.
<div n="lb"/>The Kauravas were wiped out. Yudhiṣṭhira became
<div n="lb"/>king and performed the Rajasūyayajña after which the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas went out on the great journey and gave up
<div n="lb"/>their lives.
