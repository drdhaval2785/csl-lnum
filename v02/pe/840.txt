BĀHU I¦. A king of the Sūrya-vaṃśa (solar dynasty). He
<div n="lb"/>was the father of Sagara. He is known by the name
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu also. This king was once defeated in a battle and
<div n="lb"/>being weary and sad he entered the hermitage of Aurva.
<div n="lb"/>His queen was given poison by another wife of the
<div n="lb"/>King. But the child in her womb did not die. The queen
<div n="lb"/>wanted to jump into the fire in which the body of her
<div n="lb"/>husband was to be burned. But Aurva told her that her
<div n="lb"/>son would become a famous king and that she should
<div n="lb"/>not commit suicide. Thus she desisted from committing
<div n="lb"/>suicide. A son was born to her. As she had been poison-
<div n="lb"/>ed when the child was in her womb the son was given
<div n="lb"/>the name Sagara (with poison). It is said in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva that this prince became a famous
<div n="lb"/>king later.
