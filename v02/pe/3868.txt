KUNTĪ¦ (PṚTHĀ). Wife of King Pāṇḍu and the mother
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas, Kuntī is a noble heroine in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Kuntī was the sister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva. Her real name was Pṛthā. Vasudeva and
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthā were the children of King Śūrasena of the Yādava
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. King Kuntibhoja was the son of Śūrasena's
<div n="lb"/>sister. He had no issues. Śūrasena had promised to give
<div n="lb"/>the daughter first born to him as the adopted daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Kuntibhoja, and accordingly his first-born daughter
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthā was given to Kuntibhoja, and Kuntī was brought
<div n="lb"/>up in his palace. From that day onwards Pṛthā came to
<div n="lb"/>be known as Kuntī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 111).
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī, Mādrī and Gāndhārī were born from aspects
<div n="lb"/>respectively of the three celestial women Siddhi,
[Page442-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛti and Mati. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 160).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kuntī and the mantra.%} To treat brahmins who came
<div n="lb"/>to the court of Kuntibhoja with worshipful offerings
<div n="lb"/>etc. was the duty of Kuntī. Once sage Durvāsas visited
<div n="lb"/>Kuntibhoja, and as he knew that the sage was easily
<div n="lb"/>annoyed Kuntī was specially deputed for his service,
<div n="lb"/>and she served him to the utmost. One day, to test
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī, he asked her to be ready with his food by the
<div n="lb"/>time he took his bath, and he took practically no time
<div n="lb"/>to return after bath and sit for meals. By that time
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī had managed to cook his food, which she placed
<div n="lb"/>before him in a plate. The food was too hot and steam-
<div n="lb"/>ing, and the sage meaningfully looked at the back of
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī. Realising the meaning of the look, Kuntī turned
<div n="lb"/>her back to the sage for him to place the plate of food
<div n="lb"/>thereon. The sage placed it accordingly on her back
<div n="lb"/>and began eating. Though her back was really burning
<div n="lb"/>she showed no sign of it. Pleased at her behaviour the
<div n="lb"/>sage taught her a mantra and blessed her to the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing effect.
<div n="NI"/>“Repeating this mantra you invoke whichever Deva you
<div n="lb"/>like and thanks to his favour you will get children.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 2 and
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata (Malayālam) Chapter 111).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kuntī tested the mantra.%} After the departure of
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas from the palace, Kuntī developed an irresisti-
<div n="lb"/>ble desire to test the efficacy of the mantra. and one
<div n="lb"/>day she invoked Sun-god with the mantra. Thereupon
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya approached her in the guise of a brahmin youth.
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī got alarmed. Owing to disinclination to become
<div n="lb"/>an unmarried mother Kuntī could not make up her mind
<div n="lb"/>to welcome the brahmin youth. But, Sūrya deva argued
<div n="lb"/>that his coming could not be in vain, and Kuntī had
<div n="lb"/>to yield. She requested Sūrya for a son adorned with
<div n="lb"/>helmet, ear-rings etc. (Vana Parva Chapter 207 Verse
<div n="lb"/>17).
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya assured Kuntī that even though a child was born
<div n="lb"/>to her from him, that will not affect her virginity and
<div n="lb"/>departed. Kuntī delivered a son in due course of time
<div n="lb"/>in secret. She locked up the child in a box and floated
<div n="lb"/>it in the Yamunā. An old charioteer called Adhiratha
<div n="lb"/>picked up the child from the river and brought it up as
<div n="lb"/>though it were his own son. That boy grew up to
<div n="lb"/>become the famous Karṇa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 112).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kuntī's wedding.%} In due course Kuntibhoja cele-
<div n="lb"/>brated Kuntī's Svayaṃvara and she chose King Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>of the lunar dynasty as her husband, and Pāṇḍu took
<div n="lb"/>her to Haṣtināpura in all pomp and glory. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 112).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kuntī's wedded life.%} Pāṇḍu married another wife also
<div n="lb"/>called Mādrī, and all the three of them led a very
<div n="lb"/>happy life. During one of those days Pāṇḍu went
<div n="lb"/>a hunting in the forest and arrowed to death sage Kin-
<div n="lb"/>dama, who was making love with his wife in the forest,
<div n="lb"/>both of them having assumed the forms of deer. The
<div n="lb"/>sage cursed Pāṇḍu with death the moment he touched
<div n="lb"/>his wives, and grief-stricken at the curse he told his
<div n="lb"/>wives about it and decided to take to Sannyāsa. But,
<div n="lb"/>the wives told him that they would commit suicide in
<div n="lb"/>case he took to Sannyāsa. Ultimately Pāṇḍu went to
<div n="lb"/>Śataśṛṅga with his wives, and there he began the per-
<div n="lb"/>formance of penances.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Pāṇḍu asked his wives to become
<div n="lb"/>mothers by some noble persons. But, Kuntī and Mādrī
<div n="lb"/>did not agree to it. Then Kuntī told Pāṇḍu about the
[Page443-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>boon she had got from Durvāsas, and with his per-
<div n="lb"/>mission she bore three sons called Dharmaputra, Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>and Arjuna respectively from the three Devas, Dharma,
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu and Indra. As it had been ordained that the
<div n="lb"/>fourth and fifth children would bring sorrows and pain
<div n="lb"/>to the parents Kuntī satisfied herself with three child-
<div n="lb"/>ren (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verses 77, 78).
<div n="NI"/>But, as Pāṇḍu desired that Mādrī also should have
<div n="lb"/>children by Kunti's mantra she used the remaining
<div n="lb"/>mantra and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva from the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas were born to her.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kuntī widowed.%} During a winter when the forest
<div n="lb"/>was fragrant with flowers, Pāṇḍu forgot all about the
<div n="lb"/>Sage's curse and indulged in sexual joys with Mādrī, and
<div n="lb"/>immediately he expired. Kuntī and Mādrī competed
<div n="lb"/>with each other to end their life in the funeral pyre of
<div n="lb"/>their husband. But, as the sages and other relations
<div n="lb"/>insisted that one of them should live to bring up the
<div n="lb"/>children, Mādrī alone ended her life, and Kuntī returned
<div n="lb"/>to Hastināpura with the five children. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 125).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kuntī at Hastināpura.%} At Hastināpura differences
<div n="lb"/>cropped up between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas.
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī and the five Pāṇḍavas removed themselves to
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Lac palace’ built at Vāraṇāvata. When the palace
<div n="lb"/>was gutted by fire Kuntī and her sons escaped through
<div n="lb"/>a secret tunnel to the forest, and Bhīma carried the
<div n="lb"/>worn out Kuntī on his shoulders. In the forest the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa woman Hiḍimbī, requested Kuntī to permit
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma to become her husband, and Kuntī advised
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma to beget a child by Hiḍimbī, and thus was born
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca. At the city named Ekacakrā, Vyāsa consoled
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī. There the brahmins complained to Kuntī about
<div n="lb"/>the depredations of Bakāsura. Kuntī got Baka killed by
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma and asked the brahmins to keep the matter secret.
<div n="lb"/>On the advice of a brahmin who came there accidental-
<div n="lb"/>ly Kuntī and others visited the Pāñcāla kingdom, and
<div n="lb"/>there Arjuna, having defeated all the Kings present
<div n="lb"/>at Pāñcālī's Svayaṃvara wedded her. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>who returned with Pāñcālī at dusk time were asked by
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī to enjoy that day's bhikṣā (Alms received) to-
<div n="lb"/>gether among themselves. Accordingly Pāñcālī became
<div n="lb"/>the wife of all the five Pāṇḍavas. Vidura, at the court
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāñcāla King saluted Kuntī and presented to her
<div n="lb"/>various varieties of gems. Kuntī and Vidura talked
<div n="lb"/>about the painful incidents of the past, and Vidura
<div n="lb"/>escorted the Pāṇḍavas back to Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna led a solitary life in the forest for one year, and
<div n="lb"/>then returned to Hastināpura with Subhadrā whom he
<div n="lb"/>had married meanwhile. Kuntī received Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>heartily. In the game of dice with Duryodhana, Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra was defeated, and the Pāṇḍavas again started
<div n="lb"/>for their life in the forest. During this period Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>lived in Vidura's house. Meanwhile Śrī Kṛṣṇa one day
<div n="lb"/>visited Kuntī, and she told Kṛṣṇa about the fate of her
<div n="lb"/>sons with tears in her eyes. Duryodhana refused to give
<div n="lb"/>half of the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas, who returned
<div n="lb"/>after twelve years' life in exile in the forest and one
<div n="lb"/>year's life incognito. Śrī Kṛṣṇa prompted the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>to war with the Kauravas, and both the parties began
<div n="lb"/>preparations for war. (Ādi Parva, from Chapter 135 to
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā and Vana Parvans and Udyoga Parva, upto
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 137).
[Page443-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>8). {%Kuntī before Karṇa.%} War clouds grew thick and
<div n="lb"/>fast, and Kuntī at Vidura's house got restless. Her
<div n="lb"/>heart trembled at the disasters of war as described by
<div n="lb"/>Vidura. She went alone to the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>where just then Karṇa was engaged in Japa with his
<div n="lb"/>hands raised and face turned to the east. Kuntī waited
<div n="lb"/>for some time after which they began to talk. With
<div n="lb"/>tears in her eyes Kuntī told Karṇa that he was her
<div n="lb"/>son and implored him to return to the Pāṇḍava side
<div n="lb"/>to which Karṇa replied as follows: “Oh! noble lady,
<div n="lb"/>that is quite impossible. I have vowed to kill Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>I will not kill the other four Pāṇḍavas. You shall
<div n="lb"/>always have five sons alive. If Arjuna were to be no
<div n="lb"/>more I would be there for you in his stead.”
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī shuddered at those terrible words of Karṇa,
<div n="lb"/>and thus did both of them part with each other.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapters 145 and 146).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Last days of Kuntī.%} The great war ended. Thou-
<div n="lb"/>sands of warriors on the Kaurava side like the mighty
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa were no more. On the Pāṇḍava side also many
<div n="lb"/>were killed. Though the Pāṇḍavas won the war their
<div n="lb"/>hearts no more enjoyed peace or happiness. Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>suffered as though caught in a wild fire. She asked
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas to perform the obsequies for Karṇa also.
<div n="lb"/>When she let out the secret that Karṇa was her first-
<div n="lb"/>born child Dharmaputra burst into tears. Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>consoled Subhadrā and Uttarā who were lamenting
<div n="lb"/>over the death of Abhimanyu. She requested Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to cremate the dead son of Uttarā.
<div n="NI"/>Then Kuntī went to Gāndhārī, who stood there bathed
<div n="lb"/>in tears. Grief-stricken, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>started for the forest. Holding Gāndhārī's hand in hers
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī led the way. The Pāṇḍavas prevented their
<div n="lb"/>mother from going, but she did not yield. She advised
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra to have a special eye on Sahadeva, not
<div n="lb"/>to forget Karṇa's name and not to show any dis-
<div n="lb"/>pleasure towards Bhīma and Pāñcālī. But, the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas wanted to follow their beloved mother into
<div n="lb"/>the forest. Pāñcālī and Subhadrā stationed themselves
<div n="lb"/>behind Kuntī, who shed copious tears at the sight.
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī, who also felt deeply
<div n="lb"/>pained at the sight tried their best to dissuade Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>from following them to the forest. But, Kuntī consoled
<div n="lb"/>her sons and daughters-in-law by means of sympathetic
<div n="lb"/>words and followed Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Gaṅgā, where all of them lived together.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas felt acutely the absence of their mother
<div n="lb"/>at home. They went to the forest and paid their res-
<div n="lb"/>pects to Kuntī on the banks of the Gaṅgā. Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>embraced Sahadeva with tears in her eyes. Though
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira and Sahadeva wanted to stay with Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>in her service she did not allow that. Kuntī, Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra and Gāndhārī performed penance in the forest
<div n="lb"/>near the Gaṅgā, taking food only once in a month.
<div n="lb"/>The three of them died there in a wild fire. (Āśrama-
<div n="lb"/>vāsika Parva, Chapter 37, Verse 31). Their relations
<div n="lb"/>immersed their bones in the Gaṅgā and performed the
<div n="lb"/>necessary obsequies. (Strī, Śānti, Āśramavāsika and
<div n="lb"/>Āśvamedhika Parvans).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kuntī in Devaloka.%} Kuntī, Mādrī and Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>went to Devaloka. (Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 15).
