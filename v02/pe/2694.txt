HIRAṆYAPURAM¦. A city of the Daityas. The Daitya
<div n="lb"/>woman, Pulomā got the city for her children by tapas.
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā is called Kālakā also. (Certain Purāṇas aver
<div n="lb"/>that Kālakā was the sister of Pulomā). The children of
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā are known as Kālakeyas for whose safety and
<div n="lb"/>security she did tapas for 1000 years. And, when
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā asked her to choose any boon she desired,
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā said as follows:- “There should arise no reason
<div n="lb"/>or cause for my sons to feel sorrow in their life; Devas,
<div n="lb"/>snakes or Rākṣasas should not kill them and they must
<div n="lb"/>have a beautiful city to live in. Brahmā granted her all
<div n="lb"/>the boons. Hiraṇyapura was built by Brahmā for the
<div n="lb"/>Kālakeyas to live in. It was full of gems and it could
<div n="lb"/>easily travel in the sky.
<div n="NI"/>When life became impossible for the Devas due to the
<div n="lb"/>depredations of the Kālakeyas, Indra brought
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna to Devaloka. As the Kālakeyas were granted the
<div n="lb"/>boon that they would not be killed by the Devas,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna's help had thus to be sought by Indra. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>killed the Kālakeyas and destroyed Hiraṇyapura. (Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 173). On one occasion Nārada gave
<div n="lb"/>a correct description of Hiraṇyapura to Mātali, the
<div n="lb"/>charioteer of Indra. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 100).
