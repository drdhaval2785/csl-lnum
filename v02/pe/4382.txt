MĀNUṢATĪRTHA¦. A sacred pond lying on the
<div n="lb"/>outskirts of Kurukṣetra. There is a legend showing
<div n="lb"/>the origin of this pond. Once a hunter wounded a
<div n="lb"/>deer with his arrow and the deer ran and dropped
<div n="lb"/>itself into the pond. When it rose up from the water
<div n="lb"/>it became a man. From that day onwards the pond
<div n="lb"/>became holy and got the name Mānuṣatīrtha. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>65, Chapter 86, Vana Parva).
