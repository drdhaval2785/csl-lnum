KAṆVA I¦. (KĀŚYAPA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Kaṇva attained Purāṇic fame
<div n="lb"/>as the father who brought up Śakuntalā. From Ṛgveda
[Page385-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>it can be gathered that the Kaṇva family was very
<div n="lb"/>prominent among the Ṛṣi families of ancient India.
<div n="lb"/>Because he was born in the family of sage Kaśyapa,
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā, Kaṇva was known as Kāśyapa also.
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva's father was Medhātithi as could be seen by a
<div n="lb"/>reference to him in Śloka 27, Chapter 208 of Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva as Medhātithisuta. Kaṇva was staying in a her-
<div n="lb"/>mitage on the banks of the river Mālinī, with a num-
<div n="lb"/>ber of disciples.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kaṇvāśrama.%} Vana Parva of Mahābhārata states
<div n="lb"/>that Kaṇvāśrama was on the northern shore of the
<div n="lb"/>river Praveṇī. According to certain critics Kaṇvāśrama
<div n="lb"/>was situated on the banks of the river Cambal, four
<div n="lb"/>miles to the south of ‘Kota’in Rājputānā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Kaṇva got Śakuntalā.%} Once Viśvāmitra started
<div n="lb"/>a severe penance and Indra desiring to obstruct the
<div n="lb"/>attempt sent the enchanting Menakā to entice him.
<div n="lb"/>They fell in love with each other and soon Menakā
<div n="lb"/>bore a girl. The parents left the child in the forest and
<div n="lb"/>went their way. Birds (Śakuntas) looked after her for
<div n="lb"/>some time and so she was named Śakuntalā. Accident-
<div n="lb"/>ally Kaṇva came that way and took the child to his
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Yāga of Bharata.%} Bharata, son of Duṣyanta,
<div n="lb"/>performed a peculiar type of Yāga called ‘Govitata’ with
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva as the chief preceptor to officiate. (Śloka 130,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 74, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaṇva and Duryodhana.%} Once Kaṇva narrated to
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana how Mātali and his wife Sudharmā went
<div n="lb"/>to him in search of a suitable husband to their daughter
<div n="lb"/>Guṇakeśī. (Chapter 97, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kaṇva, a sage of the east.%} When Śrī Rāma returned
<div n="lb"/>to Ayodhyā after his exile many sages from many
<div n="lb"/>different parts came to visit him. Kaṇva was one of
<div n="lb"/>those who came from the east. The others who came
<div n="lb"/>along with him were, Vasiṣṭha, Atri, Viśvāmitra,
<div n="lb"/>Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvāja, Sanaka, Śarabhaṅga
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas, Mataṅga, Vibhāṇḍaka and Tumburu.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kaṇva and Ṛgveda.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) There are ten Maṇḍalas in Ṛgveda. The Maṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍalas from two to seven are written by different Ṛṣi fami-
<div n="lb"/>lies. The second Maṇḍala was written by the Bhārgava
<div n="lb"/>family of ṛṣis, the third by the Viśvāmitra family, the
<div n="lb"/>fourth by that of Vāmadeva, the fifth by Atri, the sixth
<div n="lb"/>by that of Bharadvāja and the seventh by the family
<div n="lb"/>of Vasiṣṭha. Fifty Sūktas of the first Maṇḍala and the
<div n="lb"/>whole of the eighth Maṇḍala were written by Kaṇva.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kaṇva had a son named Medhātithi. Sūkta twelve
<div n="lb"/>of Anuvāka four in the first Maṇḍala of Ṛgveda is
<div n="lb"/>written making Medhātithi a sage.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Kaṇva had a daughter named Indīvaraprabhā
<div n="lb"/>by Menakā. (Kathāsaritsāgara). (See under Candrā-
<div n="lb"/>valoka and Kasyapa I).
