ULŪPĪ¦. Wife of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How she became the wife of Arjuna.%} Once Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>happened to enter the palace in which Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>was living with Pāñcālī. As a result, Arjuna had to go
<div n="lb"/>on a pilgrimage for a year. (See under Irāvān). Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>reached Gaṅgādvāra. When he got down into the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā, he saw Ulūpī the daughter of Nāgarāja (King
<div n="lb"/>of the serpents). He asked her a few questions. She
<div n="lb"/>told him thus:—“I am the daughter of the serpent
<div n="lb"/>Kauravya of the family of Airāvata. I came to bathe
<div n="lb"/>in the river and when I saw you I grew amorous.”
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna told her that Dharmaputra had imposed on him
<div n="lb"/>celibacy for twelve months and that it was not
<div n="lb"/>right to marry in the meantime. Ulūpī argued with
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna and convinced him that it was not wrong to
<div n="lb"/>marry her. Arjuna married her. A son named Irāvān
<div n="lb"/>was born to her.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Ulūpī caused Arjuna to be killed and how he was%}
<div n="lb"/>{%brought to life again.%} (See paras 28 and 29 under
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The end of Ulūpī.%} After having brought Arjuna back
<div n="lb"/>to life, Ulūpī reached Hastināpura with Babhruvāhana
<div n="lb"/>and Citrāṅgadā. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>87). As soon as she reached there she greeted Kuntī,
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī and Subhadrā. She gave them various kinds
<div n="lb"/>of presents. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Aśrama-
<div n="lb"/>vāsika Parva, Chapter I, Stanza 23 that Ulūpī served
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī at one time. In Mahābhārata, Āśramavāsika
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 10, Stanza 46 it is mentioned that Ulūpī
<div n="lb"/>was greatly loved by the subjects. When the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>began the ‘great departure’ (Mahāprasthāna) Ulūpī
<div n="lb"/>entered the River Ganges. Citrāṅgadā went to Maṇalū-
<div n="lb"/>rapura.
<div n="NI"/>“Ulūpī, the daughter of the serpent Kauravya, jumped
<div n="lb"/>into the Ganges and to Maṇalūrapura, went Citrāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>gadā.” (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Mahāprasthānika Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 1, Stanza 27).

<div n="lb"/>majā. These are the synonyms used in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata for Ulūpī.
