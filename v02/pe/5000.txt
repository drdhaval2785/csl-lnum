PĀṆḌYA¦. II. (A Tamilian dynasty of Kings.) A place of
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇic fame in Dakṣiṇa Bhārata. The three states
<div n="lb"/>Cera, Cola and Pāṇḍya were from early times renown-
<div n="lb"/>ed states of Dakṣiṇa Bhārata. Historically and Puraṇic-
<div n="lb"/>ally Pāṇḍya was a state of eminence.
<div n="NI"/>(A.) {%Historically.%} The Pāṇḍya dynasty of Kings is
<div n="lb"/>very ancient, The exact period of its beginning is still
<div n="lb"/>unknown. Megasthanes who lived in the fourth century
<div n="lb"/>B.C. has made mention of the Pāṇḍya dynasty in his
<div n="lb"/>diary. Julian, an emperor of Italy, who lived in 361
<div n="lb"/>A.D. is stated to have received visitors from Pāṇḍya-
<div n="lb"/>deśa. The Pāṇḍya dynasty was revived and elevated
<div n="lb"/>under the leadership of Katuṅka in the 7th century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>From that time till the 16th century Madura was the
<div n="lb"/>capital of Pāṇḍyadeśa. The Uccāṅgī dynasty which was
<div n="lb"/>ruling the places to the south of Tuṅgabhadrā during
<div n="lb"/>the period from 9th century to 13th century A.D. is
<div n="lb"/>believed to be a part of the Pāṇḍyavaṃśa which had
<div n="lb"/>gone from Madura. A continuous history of the Pāṇḍya
<div n="lb"/>line of Kings is not available. Many Kings bear names
<div n="lb"/>like Jātavarmā or Māravarmā. The Pāṇḍya Kings
<div n="lb"/>were devotees of Śiva even from the period of the
<div n="lb"/>Jainas. At times they have ruled over the combined
<div n="lb"/>kingdoms of Cera and Cola. During the period from
<div n="lb"/>the 12th to the 14th century A.D. Pāṇḍya was ruled by
<div n="lb"/>five of the most valiant rulers and at that time the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍyadeśa included all the places in south India up
<div n="lb"/>to Nellore. But the power of the Pāṇḍyas waned when
<div n="lb"/>the power of the Sultans who ruled Delhi spread to the
<div n="lb"/>south. After 1370 A.D only on rare occasions has the
<div n="lb"/>power of the Pāṇḍyas spread to the north of river
<div n="lb"/>Kāverī. In 1312 A.D. Kerala got herself free from the
<div n="lb"/>hold of the Tamilian Kings. (Pāṇḍyarājya).
