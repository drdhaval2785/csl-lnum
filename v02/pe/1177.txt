BHOṢA¦. A word meaning a comic, stupid or eccentric
<div n="lb"/>person. Bhoṣas are of eight kinds. Those who feel
<div n="lb"/>derided, those who babble, those who are obstinate,
<div n="lb"/>sophists, those who indulge in hollow laughter, those
<div n="lb"/>who pretend to be blind, those who pretend to be deaf,
<div n="lb"/>and those who try to assert their self-importance—these
<div n="lb"/>are the eight classes of “Bhoṣas”.
