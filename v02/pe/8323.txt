VIJITĀŚVA¦. One of the five sons of emperor Pṛthu.
<div n="lb"/>Vijitāśva decided to perform one hundred horse-
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices and completed ninetynine. Seeing this Indra
<div n="lb"/>feared that he might be deposed. So he stealthily took

<div n="NI"/>There was a fierce battle between Indra and Vijitāśva
<div n="lb"/>in which Indra was defeated, and Vijitāśva recovered

<div n="lb"/>Being pleased with the King at this expert fighting,
<div n="lb"/>Devendra taught him the art of vanishing. (Bhāgavata.
