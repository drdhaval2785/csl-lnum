NARAKA I¦. (NARAKĀSURA). A valiant Asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Once the Asura Hiraṇyākṣa was amusing
<div n="lb"/>himself by wading through the ocean and beating at
<div n="lb"/>the waves with his club. Varuṇa, the god of water, was
<div n="lb"/>alarmed at this and ran to Mahāviṣṇu and told him
<div n="lb"/>every thing. Hearing this Mahāviṣṇu got up to kill
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa. Hiraṇyākṣa who had assumed the form of
<div n="lb"/>a Boar carried the earth on his tusks and ran to Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>As the goddess earth had come into contact with the
<div n="lb"/>tusks of Hiraṇyākṣa she became pregnant and gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to an asura infant of immense might and power. That
<div n="lb"/>infant was Narakāsura.
<div n="NI"/>Taking the infant born from impurity the sad goddess
<div n="lb"/>Earth went to Mahāviṣṇu and requested him to save
<div n="lb"/>the child somehow. Mahāviṣṇu pitied him and gave
<div n="lb"/>him Nārāyaṇāstra (Nārāyaṇa's weapon) and said:
<div n="lb"/>“Naraka! So long as this weapon is with you, nobody
<div n="lb"/>but me could kill you.” Saying this he disappeared.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Administration.%} Narakāsura made Prāgjyotiṣa his
<div n="lb"/>capital and ruled over the asuras as their emperor for
<div n="lb"/>a long time, all the while terrifying the Devas. Once
<div n="lb"/>this asura raped Kaśerū the daughter of Tvaṣṭā. He
<div n="lb"/>brought sixteen thousand and one hundred maidens
<div n="lb"/>from the women of the earth and the world of gods. He
<div n="lb"/>made them captives at Audaka on the top of the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Maṇiparvata. He appointed four mighty and
<div n="lb"/>fearful asuras: Hayagrīva, Nisunda, Pañcanada and
<div n="lb"/>Mura as gate-keepers of Prāgjyotiṣa. As they stood
<div n="lb"/>blocking the way up to Devayāna, nobody dared to
<div n="lb"/>enter Prāgjyotiṣa. The ten sons of Narakāsura guarded
<div n="lb"/>the harem. At the boundary of the country Murāsura
<div n="lb"/>had tied six thousand ropes with a sword at the end of
<div n="lb"/>each. So enemies dared not come near the boundary.
<div n="lb"/>When Sugrīva gave instructions to the monkeys who
<div n="lb"/>were sent in search of Sītā, about the route they were
<div n="lb"/>to follow, he had mentioned about the city of Prāg-
<div n="lb"/>jyotiṣa. Mention is made in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 42 that Sugrīva had given
<div n="lb"/>them special instructions to search for Sītā in Prāg-
<div n="lb"/>jyotiṣa. (M.B. Viṣṇu Parva, Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Previous birth of Naraka.%} Long ago a king who was
<div n="lb"/>the father of Sixteen thousand daughters, ruled over a
<div n="lb"/>country. While the father and daughters were sitting in
<div n="lb"/>the palace Mahāviṣṇu came there as a hermit. The
<div n="lb"/>sixteen thousand damsels gathered round the hermit.
<div n="lb"/>Their father got angry and cursed them. The daughters
<div n="lb"/>shed tears and entreated their father for liberation from
<div n="lb"/>the curse. He gave them remission and said that in the
<div n="lb"/>next birth they would become wives of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>Another version of this story says that the damsels had
<div n="lb"/>requested Brahmā for liberation from the curse
<div n="lb"/>according to the advice of the hermit Nārada, and
<div n="lb"/>that Brahmā had given them liberation from the curse.
<div n="lb"/>In some versions it is stated that Nārada himself gave
<div n="lb"/>them liberation from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>It was this King, who was the father of the sixteen
<div n="lb"/>thousand damsels, who took birth again as Narakāsura.
<div n="lb"/>Those sixteen thousand damsels who had been born as
<div n="lb"/>princesses in different places were taken captives by
<div n="lb"/>Narakāsura and were kept in Audaka. (Bhāgavata,
[Page531-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} Narakāsura who had been causing devast-
<div n="lb"/>ation and terror in the three worlds entered the world
<div n="lb"/>of the gods once. The gods were not able to withstand
<div n="lb"/>the fury of Naraka, who carried away the ear-rings of
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, the mother of Indra, and the large white royal
<div n="lb"/>umbrella of Indra to Prāgjyotiṣa. Indra went to Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>and told Śrī Kṛṣṇa of the molestations he had received
<div n="lb"/>at the hands of Narakāsura. Śrī Kṛṣṇa rode on his
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa with his wife Satyabhāmā to Prāgjyotiṣa. They
<div n="lb"/>flew over the city round and understood the lay-out of
<div n="lb"/>the city, and the precautions taken by Narakāsura. The
<div n="lb"/>battle began after this reconnaissance. Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā and Garuḍa fought with the asuras. The
<div n="lb"/>might asuras such as Mura, Tāmra, Antarīkṣa, Śravaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Vasu, Vibhāvasu, Nabhasvān, Aruṇa and others were
<div n="lb"/>killed. At last Narakāsura himself entered the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field. A fierce battle ensued in which Naraka was killed.
<div n="lb"/>The divine weapon Nārāyaṇāstra of Naraka was given
<div n="lb"/>to his son Bhagadatta. After the battle Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā went to the world of the gods and returned
<div n="lb"/>the ear-rings to Aditi and the umbrella to Indra.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
