ĀJAGARAVRATA¦. The vrata practised by the sage,
<div n="lb"/>Ajagara. (A vrata is a predetermined course of action
<div n="lb"/>which is followed with continued persistence). In his
<div n="lb"/>own words it is the following: “If I get a grand feast
<div n="lb"/>I will accept it but I will go without food for days
<div n="lb"/>together if I do not get any food at all. People used to
<div n="lb"/>feed me well sometimes, sometimes a little and some-
<div n="lb"/>times not at all. I will eat vegetables and cakes some-
<div n="lb"/>times. I will eat meat and any kind of food. I will lie on
<div n="lb"/>soft bed or on bare earth sometimes and in big houses
<div n="lb"/>if I get the chance. I will wear costly clothes if I get
<div n="lb"/>them or I will wear dried leaves and animal skins. If
<div n="lb"/>I get food from yāgaśālās I will never refuse it, but I
<div n="lb"/>will never go seeking for it.” (Ślokas 19-25, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>179, Śānti Parva, M.B.).
