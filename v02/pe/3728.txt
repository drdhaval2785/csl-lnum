KṢEMADARŚĪ¦. A King of Kosala. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahābhārata stating how the hermit Kālaka-
<div n="lb"/>vṛkṣīya saved this King from the trap laid by his
<div n="lb"/>favourites. The treasury-keeper spent the money of the
<div n="lb"/>King lavishly on himself. The subjects began to
<div n="lb"/>consider how to inform the King about this. Finally
[Page433-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Kālakavṛkṣīya began to travel throughout
<div n="lb"/>the country with a crow kept in a cage. As if the
<div n="lb"/>crow was speaking, the hermit began to tell the past,
<div n="lb"/>present and future fortunes of the people. The crow
<div n="lb"/>became famous and people began to have faith in the
<div n="lb"/>crow. Once Kālakavṛkṣīya and the crow reached the
<div n="lb"/>palace and under the pretence that the crow was speak-
<div n="lb"/>ing, the hermit disclosed all the secret dealings of the
<div n="lb"/>treasury-keeper. The servants of the King stealthily
<div n="lb"/>put the crow to death that night. When the King
<div n="lb"/>knew this he made Kālakavṛkṣīya the minister and the
<div n="lb"/>country began to prosper. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>82).
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion the treasury of the King Kṣema-
<div n="lb"/>darśī became empty. At this time King Janaka had
<div n="lb"/>come to war with this King. According to the sincere
<div n="lb"/>advice of Kālakavṛkṣīya the King married the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of King Janaka. From that day onwards his country
<div n="lb"/>became prosperous. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 106).
