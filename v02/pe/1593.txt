CITRARATHA VIII¦. Son of Vīrabāhu and a friend of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma. In the Rājya Kāṇḍa of Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>there is the following story about him.
<div n="NI"/>Citraratha was also one among those assembled for the
<div n="lb"/>svayaṃvara of Hemā, daughter of Kuśa. He sent an
<div n="lb"/>anaesthetic missile to the assemblage and made them
<div n="lb"/>all fall down senseless. He then took Hemā out from the
<div n="lb"/>marriage hall. But on reaching outside he felt he had
<div n="lb"/>done a very unjust thing and so withdrew the missile
<div n="lb"/>and stood outside ready to fight. A fight ensued in
<div n="lb"/>which Citraratha defeated all. But Lava alone continued
<div n="lb"/>to fight with him. Vīrabāhu, father of Citraratha, who
<div n="lb"/>was closely watching the fight came to the help of Citra-
<div n="lb"/>ratha and engaging Lava in a fight struck him down.
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa seeing this attacked Vīrabāhu and bound him
<div n="lb"/>hand and foot. At that time Śrī Rāma came to the scene
<div n="lb"/>and told Kuśa that Vīrabāhu was a friend of his and
<div n="lb"/>set Vīrabāhu free. Hemā was then married to Citra-
<div n="lb"/>ratha and Vīrabāhu was sent away with due respect.
