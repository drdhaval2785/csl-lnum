BINDUGA¦. A Brāhmaṇa who lived in the village of
<div n="lb"/>Bāṣkala. Being a frequenter of the houses of harlots
<div n="lb"/>and of various other mean habits, he had led his wife
<div n="lb"/>Cañcalā also to lead an immoral life. Once Binduga
<div n="lb"/>called his wife and told her thus: “You may continue
<div n="lb"/>the life of a harlot; but all the money acquired must be
<div n="lb"/>handed over to me.” Thus they continued their lives
<div n="lb"/>and after their death both were reborn as devils in the
<div n="lb"/>mountain of Vindhya. In the midst of their life as devils,
<div n="lb"/>once it chanced for Cañcalā to hear the Śiva Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>recited and she got her shape of devil changed. She
<div n="lb"/>requested Pārvatī to change the shape of her husband
<div n="lb"/>also. Pārvatī sent her attendant Tumburu to Binduga
<div n="lb"/>to tell him the story of Śiva and thus he also got his form
<div n="lb"/>changed. (Śiva Purāṇa Māhātmya).
