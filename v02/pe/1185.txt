BHṚŚUṆḌI¦. A fisherman. He used to earn his living
<div n="lb"/>by theft.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the Mahaṛṣi Mudgala was passing through
<div n="lb"/>a forest, Bhṛśuṇḍi stopped him. But in the presence of
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmanic effulgence of the Mahaṛṣi, the fisherman
<div n="lb"/>was dazed. Mudgala took pity on Bhṛśuṇḍi and advised
<div n="lb"/>him to worship Lord Gaṇeśa.
<div n="NI"/>From that time Bhṛśuṇḍi gave up his evil ways, and
<div n="lb"/>accepting the advice of Mudgala, started the worship
<div n="lb"/>of Gaṇeśa with single-minded devotion. As a result
<div n="lb"/>of it, an elephant's trunk began to grow from the middle
<div n="lb"/>of his forehead. Bhṛśuṇḍi who thus acquired a shape
<div n="lb"/>closely resembling Gaṇeśa, was visited by Indra, mis-
<div n="lb"/>taking him for Gaṇapati. (Gaṇeśa: 1.67).
