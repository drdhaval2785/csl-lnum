<div n="lb"/>ged 20,000 people to cook food for guests who came to

<div n="lb"/>ing guests day and night alike. He gifted away all
<div n="lb"/>wealth which had been righteously earned, to brahmins.
<div n="lb"/>He learned Vedas and subdued enemies by Dharma
<div n="lb"/>(righteousness). The very blood that flowed from the skin
