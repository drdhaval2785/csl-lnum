KṚTAYUGA¦. There are four Yugas (Eras) called Kṛta,
<div n="lb"/>Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali yugas. (For the set up etc.
<div n="lb"/>of the Yugas see under Manvantara).
<div n="NI"/>In the first Yuga, i.e. Kṛta yuga, people will be quite
<div n="lb"/>righteous. As the Yugas change righteousness will fade
<div n="lb"/>out in increasing measure till the world will be filled
<div n="lb"/>with unrighteousness and evil by the time it is Kaliyuga.
<div n="lb"/>When Kaliyuga is completed Mahāviṣṇu will incarnate
<div n="lb"/>himself as Kalki and wipe out unrighteousness and estab-
<div n="lb"/>lish Kṛtayuga once again.
