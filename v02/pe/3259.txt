KANYĀKUMĀRĪ¦ (KANYAKŪPA; KANYĀTĪRTHA)
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Mahābhārata makes references
<div n="lb"/>in many places to Kanyākumārī, the southern extremi-
<div n="lb"/>ty of former Kerala and Gokarṇa, the northern
<div n="lb"/>boundary. It must, therefore, be surmised that these
<div n="lb"/>two holy places were very ancient ones. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>praises Kanyākumārī at many places. If any one bathes
<div n="lb"/>at this place one will become very famous. (Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Chapter eighty-five of Araṇya Parva, of Bhāṣā Bhārata
<div n="lb"/>speaks praisingly of Kanyākumārī and Gokarṇa among
<div n="lb"/>other places. It says thus:
[Page386-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>“If you visit Ṛṣabhācala of Pāṇḍyadeśa you will get the
<div n="lb"/>benefit of conducting an Aśvamedhayāga. Then you
<div n="lb"/>must go farther south and take a dip in Kanyātīrṭha.
<div n="lb"/>The touch of that water absolves you of all sins. Then
<div n="lb"/>visit Gokarṇa situated in the ocean famous in all the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds and worshipped by all.”
<div n="NI"/>From this it is to be understood that ot the time of
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata Kanyākumārī was part of Pāṇḍyadeśa
<div n="lb"/>and that Gokarṇa was an island.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Purāṇic stories about Kanyākumārī.%} There are several
<div n="lb"/>stories regarding the origin and renown of Kanyā-
<div n="lb"/>kumārī in the Purāṇas. The most important ones are
<div n="lb"/>given below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Absolver of sins.%} The wife of a brahmin named
<div n="lb"/>Apañcika living in Kāśī became unchaste and to wash
<div n="lb"/>away her sin she came to Kanyākumārī walking all
<div n="lb"/>the way and did penance there, daily bathing in its
<div n="lb"/>waters. She attained Salvation and it is believed that
<div n="lb"/>a bath in its waters would absolve anybody of all his
<div n="lb"/>sins. (Maṇimekhala).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Cakra tīrtha of Kanyākumārī.%} Puṇyakāśī, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Mayāsura, once went to Kailāsa and worshipped Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>After three yugas Śiva appeared before her and asked
<div n="lb"/>her what she wanted. She replied that she wanted to
<div n="lb"/>be merged in Śiva always. Śiva then said ‘Three
<div n="lb"/>hundred and sixtyfive days would make a year. Four
<div n="lb"/>lakhs and thirtythree years would make a Kali Yuga.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali are four Yugas and
<div n="lb"/>when two thousand such Yugas are over Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>finishes a day. Such thirty days make one month and
<div n="lb"/>twelve months, a year for Brahmā. When such hundred
<div n="lb"/>years of Brahmā are over the great deluge comes. Such
<div n="lb"/>ten deluges make a nāzhikā (twentyfour minutes) of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Counting thus when you pass ten Viṣṇu deluges
<div n="lb"/>Śiva passes a second. Then is the time for the fulfil-
<div n="lb"/>ment of your desire. Till that time you sit in medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion on the shores of the south seas. Your hermitage
<div n="lb"/>would be known as Kanyākṣetra or Tapaḥ Sthala.
<div n="lb"/>During your stay there you must kill all the wicked
<div n="lb"/>people like Bāṇāsura and give relief to the people. I
<div n="lb"/>will also come and stay with you there then.”
<div n="NI"/>Puṇyakāśī after prostrating before Śiva went to the
<div n="lb"/>south seas. Taking a Japamālā (necklace for prayer) in
<div n="lb"/>her hands she assumed the name Kanyākumārī, and
<div n="lb"/>started her penance. After conquering all the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds demon Bāṇa was having a wicked rule over his
<div n="lb"/>people when he saw Kanyākumārī and asked her to be
<div n="lb"/>his wife. He approached her with his wicked servants
<div n="lb"/>Durmukha and Durdarśana. But Kanyākumārī flatly
<div n="lb"/>refused and in the battle that ensued, Bāṇāsura fell dead
<div n="lb"/>by the Cakrāyudha (Discus) of Devī and at that spot
<div n="lb"/>is the Cakratīrtha. (Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The phantom child which escaped from the hands
<div n="lb"/>of Kaṃsa at the time of the birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was that
<div n="lb"/>divine lady Kanyākumārī. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Geographical view.%} It is said that there was an
<div n="lb"/>extension of the present continent to the south and that
<div n="lb"/>expansive land called Lamūria was later submerged in
<div n="lb"/>waters. There is a description of such an extended land
<div n="lb"/>in some of the old literature like Cilappadikāram.”
<div n="lb"/>Kanyākumārī which was called ‘Kumāri-ambādi’ also
<div n="lb"/>was the first setu; Dhanuṣkoṭi the middle setu; and
<div n="lb"/>Koṭikkara, last setu. (Setu Purāṇa)
[Page387-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>4) {%In History.%} Kanyākumārī had attracted the atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion of foreigners long before Christ. Herodotus who
<div n="lb"/>lived in the third century B.C. has written about
<div n="lb"/>Kanyākumārī in one of his books.
<div n="NI"/>In the book ‘Periplus’ written in 60 A.D. there is a
<div n="lb"/>mention of Kanyākumārī. It says: “Pious persons at
<div n="lb"/>the fag end of their lives dedicate their lives to God
<div n="lb"/>and go to Kanyākumārī on a pilgrimage and stay there
<div n="lb"/>accepting an ascetic life. A divine lady bathed in the
<div n="lb"/>holy waters there grants you ‘darśana’.”
<div n="NI"/>Ptolemy another traveller who lived two thousand years
<div n="lb"/>ago refers to Kanyākumārī in his book as ‘Komaria
<div n="lb"/>Akron’. He had bathed in those waters and worshipped
<div n="lb"/>in the Kanyākumārī temple.
<div n="NI"/>Marco Polo of Venice who had travelled these parts in
<div n="lb"/>1243 A.D. has written of his worshipping in the Kanyā-
<div n="lb"/>kumārī temple. He has also recorded having seen thirty
<div n="lb"/>miles from Kanyākumārī a glittering figure like that of
<div n="lb"/>the Pole-star.
<div n="NI"/>Ibn Batūtā who lived in 1203 A.D. has referred to
<div n="lb"/>Kanyākumārī in his book as Rāskuṃhari.
