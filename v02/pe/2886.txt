JARATKĀRU I¦. A hermit who is Purāṇically famous.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This hermit was born in a Brāhmaṇa dy-
<div n="lb"/>nasty known as Yāyāvaras. He was the only son of
<div n="lb"/>Yāyāvaras. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The name Jaratkāru.%} The meaning of the name
<div n="lb"/>Jaratkāru is given in Bhāṣābhārata, Ādī Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>40, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Jarā is consumption, Kāru is dāruṇa (awful). By and
<div n="lb"/>by his body became hard and awful and by penance
<div n="lb"/>he made his body to wear out, and so he got the name
<div n="lb"/>‘Jaratkāru’.”
[Page348-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>By means of penance he made his body lean and worn
<div n="lb"/>out and so got the name Jaratkāru.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} The calm and abstemious Jaratkāru
<div n="lb"/>remained unmarried for a long time. One day he
<div n="lb"/>happened to meet with his Manes. They were holding
<div n="lb"/>on to a grass and were about to fall into hell, and a
<div n="lb"/>rat was cutting the root of the grass which was their
<div n="lb"/>only hold. The moment the root is severed all the
<div n="lb"/>Manes would fall into the deep ravine of hell. It was
<div n="lb"/>at this juncture that Jaratkāru, met his Manes. The
<div n="lb"/>moment they saw him they said, “See Jaratkāru, we
<div n="lb"/>are your Manes. We have to obtain, heaven, life, con-
<div n="lb"/>tentment and happiness by the good deeds of your
<div n="lb"/>son. So go and get married quickly.”
<div n="NI"/>At first he did not like the talk about marriage. Still,
<div n="lb"/>in order to procure heaven for his ancestors he agreed
<div n="lb"/>to get married. But he made a condition that the name
<div n="lb"/>of the bride also should be Jaratkāru and she should
<div n="lb"/>be given to him as alms. Saying these words, he
<div n="lb"/>walked away along the forest.
<div n="NI"/>News reached the ears of Vāsuki, the King of the
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas (serpents) that the hermit Jaratkāru was
<div n="lb"/>wandering through the forests calling out that somebody
<div n="lb"/>should give him as alms a damsel named Jaratkāru.
<div n="lb"/>Vāsuki had a sister. Jaratkāru was her name. Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>decided to give her to the hermit Jaratkāru. She was
<div n="lb"/>adorned with costly garments and ornaments and was
<div n="lb"/>taken to the hermit Jaratkāru. Jaratkāru said:—
<div n="NI"/>“Hear my condition, I will not cherish her if she
<div n="lb"/>causes displeasure to me. If she does so I will send
<div n="lb"/>her away instantly.”
<div n="NI"/>On condition that if she did anything displeasing to
<div n="lb"/>him he would leave her at once, the hermit Jaratkāru
<div n="lb"/>married Jaratkāru the sister of Vāsuki. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 2; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 13 and 47).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Leaves his wife.%} Jaratkāru lived in the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>with her husband looking after him with love and
<div n="lb"/>loyalty. One day the hermit was sleeping with his head
<div n="lb"/>on the lap of his wife. Though it was sunset the hermit
<div n="lb"/>slept on. It was time for the evening worship
<div n="lb"/>of the hermit. If he is aroused he will get angry. The
<div n="lb"/>wife was in a difficult situation. Anyhow she aroused
<div n="lb"/>her husband. The hermit got up full of anger and
<div n="lb"/>shouted, “You have hindered my sleep, you wicked
<div n="lb"/>woman and teased me. So from today you are not my
<div n="lb"/>wife. I am going away.”
<div n="NI"/>She begged him for pardon with tears. But without
<div n="lb"/>paying any heed to the entreaties of his pregnant wife,
<div n="lb"/>he left her.
<div n="NI"/>The helpless Jaratkāru gave birth to a son named
<div n="lb"/>Āstīka who later stopped the famous sacrifice, Sarpa
<div n="lb"/>Satra meant for killing the serpents. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 47). See under Jaratkāru II.
