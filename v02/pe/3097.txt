<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa married her. Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 183 states that Kālakeya and Narakāsura were
<div n="lb"/>born to Kālakā by Kaśyapa. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Chapter 14). In Mahābhārata Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 174 we find that Kālakā once received
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmā, a boon that her sons would never be
<div n="lb"/>killed.
