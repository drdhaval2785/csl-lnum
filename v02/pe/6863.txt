SUBRAHMAṆYA¦. Son of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Reason for birth.%} A son named Vajrāṅga was born to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapaprajāpati by his wife Danu and he married a
<div n="lb"/>girl called Varāṅgī. Vajrāṅga performed penance to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā so that he might shed his āsuric aspect. When
<div n="lb"/>he came out of his penance, Varāṅgī was missing and he
<div n="lb"/>wandered about the forest in search of her. Finally he saw
<div n="lb"/>Varāṅgī crying under a tree. When he asked her the reason
<div n="lb"/>for her weeping, she told him about harassments by Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>during the thousand years when Vajrāṅga was immers-
<div n="lb"/>ed in trance. Indra one day threw about the vessels
<div n="lb"/>used by her in worship, appearing before her in the
<div n="lb"/>guise of a monkey; on another occasion he threatened
<div n="lb"/>her in the form of a lion and on a third occasion he
<div n="lb"/>came disguised as a snake and bit on her legs. Very
<div n="lb"/>much grieved over the story Vajrāṅga again took to
<div n="lb"/>penance with the grim determination to punish Indra
<div n="lb"/>and when Brahmā appeared before him he prayed for
<div n="lb"/>the boon of a son who would surpass the Devas includ-
<div n="lb"/>ing Indra in prowess. Brahmā granted him the boon.
<div n="lb"/>Varāṅgī delivered a son twelve months after the boon.
<div n="lb"/>The child was christened Tārakāsura.
<div n="NI"/>Tārakāsura, as a child, began practising penance and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā duly appeared before him and granted him
<div n="lb"/>the boon that if he were to die, he would die at the
<div n="lb"/>hands of a child only seven days old. Haughty over the
<div n="lb"/>boon Tārakāsura very soon conquered the three worlds.
<div n="lb"/>The devas found no means to suppress the asura. Child-
<div n="lb"/>ren would not be born to them and there was a reason
<div n="lb"/>for it. Once Śiva and Pārvatī started the marital act
<div n="lb"/>and it did not come to a close even after a hundred
<div n="lb"/>divya-years, with the result that the world shook like
<div n="lb"/>anything. Frightened at this the Devas requested
<div n="lb"/>Śiva to stop the act and he obliged them. Then he
<div n="lb"/>asked them who would bear the semen which had been
<div n="lb"/>discharged and they replied, “Let earth itself bear the
[Page747-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>semen.” Accordingly it was discharged on the earth.
<div n="lb"/>It filled and over-flowed forests and mountains.
<div n="lb"/>What next was the problem. Ultimately the Devas
<div n="lb"/>asked Agni (fire) to consume it. When Agni consumed
<div n="lb"/>and burnt it down absolutely, the ashes thereof form-
<div n="lb"/>ed into a white hill and it became a forest.
<div n="NI"/>Pārvatī did not at all relish the action of the devas and
<div n="lb"/>spoke to them thus: “You prevented my sexual inter-
<div n="lb"/>course entered into with the desire to have a son.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, in future you will not have children by your
<div n="lb"/>wives.” Pārvatī cursed the earth also as follows:
<div n="lb"/>“You will become one of various forms and also a wife
<div n="lb"/>to many people. You, who prevented me from having
<div n="lb"/>a son, will not enjoy happiness from children.” (Vālmī-
<div n="lb"/>ki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 36).
<div n="NI"/>Tārakāsura could be killed only by a child not more
<div n="lb"/>than seven days old and the Devas realised that such
<div n="lb"/>a child could be begot only by Śiva. It was the occas-
<div n="lb"/>ion when Śiva was lamenting over the death of Satī and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī was doing penance to secure Śiva as husband.
<div n="lb"/>None could stir Śiva immersed in deep meditation
<div n="lb"/>and the Devas entrusted the responsibility for it to
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva. Not only did Kāma not succeed in the
<div n="lb"/>endeavour but also he got reduced to ashes by the fire
<div n="lb"/>from Śiva's eyes. When Pārvatī's penance reached its
<div n="lb"/>climax Śiva appeared before her and wedded her.
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Birth of Subrahmaṇya.%} Because of the power of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's semen consumed by Agni, his glow began getting
<div n="lb"/>diminished. Agni complained of it to the Devas who
<div n="lb"/>sent him over to Brahmā. On his way to Brahmā Agni
<div n="lb"/>met Gaṅgādevī whom he told thus: “I can in no way
<div n="lb"/>bear this semen of Śiva and if I get rid of it, it will
<div n="lb"/>burn the entire world. So, you please take charge of it
<div n="lb"/>so that you will have a noble son. Gaṅgā's reply to
<div n="lb"/>this was simply to ask Agni to throw the semen into
<div n="lb"/>her waters and Agni did so. As the semen had remained
<div n="lb"/>with Agni for nearly 5000 years, his flesh, blood
<div n="lb"/>hair, eye etc. had become golden in colour and hence
<div n="lb"/>Agni came to be called from that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyaretas.
<div n="NI"/>Time passed by and the semen of Śiva became a burden
<div n="lb"/>to Gaṅgā. She complained about that to Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā asked her from whom she had received the
<div n="lb"/>semen. Gaṅgā detailed her story to him and concluded
<div n="lb"/>by saying that though it was 5000 years since Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>semen was put into her, she did not deliver yet. Then
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā told her as follows: “You go to the Udaya
<div n="lb"/>mountain (where the sun rises). There is a forest there,
<div n="lb"/>a forest hundred crores of yojanas in extent, where
<div n="lb"/>Śara, a particular variety of grass (Saccharam munja
<div n="lb"/>Roxb) grows. You deposit the semen there and a male
<div n="lb"/>child will be born after 10,000 years.
<div n="NI"/>As directed by Brahmā Gaṅgā went to the Udaya
<div n="lb"/>mountain and deposited the foetus there through her
<div n="lb"/>mouth.
<div n="NI"/>By the power of Śiva's semen all the trees and animals
<div n="lb"/>and birds in the forest became golden in colour.
<div n="lb"/>When 10,000 years were completed a child, as effulgent
<div n="lb"/>as the rising sun, was born and Subrahmaṇya was the
<div n="lb"/>child. The child cried in a thunderous voice and six
<div n="lb"/>divine Kṛttikās who came that way saw the child and
<div n="lb"/>taking pity on it vied with one another to breast-feed
<div n="lb"/>it. Since the child looked at the six Kṛttikās one after
<div n="lb"/>the other it developed six faces and since it was breast-fed
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛttikās it came to be named Kārttikeya as well.
[Page748-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā informed Agni about the birth of the child
<div n="lb"/>and the latter, in great happiness, hastened to it on a
<div n="lb"/>fast goat. Gaṅgā who met Agni on the way and asked
<div n="lb"/>him about his hurried trip was told about the birth of
<div n="lb"/>the child and between the two developed an argument
<div n="lb"/>about the ownership of the child. Mahāviṣṇu who came
<div n="lb"/>that way just then listened to the above argument and
<div n="lb"/>directed them to Śiva for settlement of their claims.
<div n="NI"/>Agni and Gaṅgā asked Śiva to which of them the child
<div n="lb"/>really belonged Śiva then told Pārvatī “Fortunate,
<div n="lb"/>fortunate.” Only after seeing the child could it be
<div n="lb"/>decided as to whose it was and so Śiva, Pārvatī, Agni
<div n="lb"/>and Gaṅgā proceeded together to the forest where they
<div n="lb"/>saw the child in the lap of the Kṛttikās. Śiva then
<div n="lb"/>said “Let us see whom the child looks at before settling
<div n="lb"/>its parentage.” Understanding the ideas of the visitors
<div n="lb"/>the child, by its yogic power, assumed four bodies
<div n="lb"/>called Kumāra, Viśākha, Śākha and Naigameya.
<div n="lb"/>Kumāra looked at Śiva, Viśākha at Pārvatī, Śākha at
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Naigameya at Agni and all of them felt
<div n="lb"/>immensely happy. The Kṛttikās asked Śiva whether
<div n="lb"/>Ṣaṇmukha (child with six faces) was his son to which
<div n="lb"/>Śiva answered as follows: “Let him be your son under
<div n="lb"/>the name Kārttikeya; Gaṅgā's son under the name
<div n="lb"/>Kumāra; Pārvatī's son under the name Skanda; my
<div n="lb"/>son under the name Guha and Agni's son with the
<div n="lb"/>name Mahāsena and under the name Śaravaṇa ‘Śara-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇa's (the forest where it was born) son. He is a
<div n="lb"/>great yogī and will be known by these various names.
<div n="lb"/>As he possesses six faces he will become famous as
<div n="lb"/>‘Ṣaṇmukha’ also.
<div n="NI"/>After having spoken thus Śiva thought of the Devas
<div n="lb"/>and under the leadership of Brahmā and Viṣṇu all the
<div n="lb"/>Devas appeared there. They looked at the child to their
<div n="lb"/>hearts’ content and then told Śiva thus: “Oh! Lord!
<div n="lb"/>You made Agni serve the purpose of Devas. Let us
<div n="lb"/>immediately start for Aujasa tīrtha and crown Ṣaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>mukha at Sarasvatī in Kurukṣetra. Let him flourish
<div n="lb"/>as army-chief of Devas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras and
<div n="lb"/>let him kill the terrible Mahiṣāsura and Tārakāsura.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Coronation.%} Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and others reached
<div n="lb"/>Kuruksetra with the child to crown him (Subrahmaṇya)
<div n="lb"/>as army-chief. Śiva and Viṣṇu performed the consecra-
<div n="lb"/>tion ceremony with holy water from the seven seas.
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas, Ṛṣis and others sang for joy and Apsarās
<div n="lb"/>danced. Pārvatī placed the child thus consecrated on
<div n="lb"/>her lap and kissed him repeatedly on the head.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Presents.%} After Guha's consecration, the Devas
<div n="lb"/>presented the army-chief valorous armies. He was
<div n="lb"/>given by Śiva four Pramathas, equal in prowess to
<div n="lb"/>Indra, called Ghaṇṭākarna, Lohitākṣa, Nandiṣeṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Kumudamālī. Brahmā and other Devas gave their
<div n="lb"/>own Pramathas to him. Brahmā gave him the Pra-
<div n="lb"/>matha called Sthāṇu and Viṣṇu gave him three sets of
<div n="lb"/>Pramathas called Saṅkrama, Vikrama and Parākrama.
<div n="lb"/>Indra gave him Utkleśa and Paṅkaja; Sun (Sūrya)
<div n="lb"/>gave Daṇḍakapiñjalas; Moon gave Maṇivasumaṇis;
<div n="lb"/>the Asvins gave Vatsanandis etc. In short, important
<div n="lb"/>Devas, Mātṛs, Tīrthas etc. gave Subrahmaṇya price-
<div n="lb"/>less presents too numerous to be named.
<div n="NI"/>Seeing the rush of presents the great Garuḍa presented
<div n="lb"/>his own son, the fast-going Peacock to Subrahmanya.
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa gave his own son, the cock. Agni gave the Vel
<div n="lb"/>(three-pronged weapon, trident), Bṛhaspati the daṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>(club, stick) Gaṅgā, the Kamaṇḍalu (water-pot of
[Page748-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Sannyāsins) Viṣṇu the garland, Pārvatī clothes, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>the locket and Indra the string of pearls.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Devāsura war.%} The consecration of Subrahmaṇya
<div n="lb"/>as Commander-in-Chief of the army kindled a new
<div n="lb"/>hope and enthusiasm in the Devas. They challenged
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras for war and they took it up. The asura
<div n="lb"/>army entered the battle-field under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>unrivalled warriors like Tārakāsura, Mahiṣa, Bāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>son of Mahābali, Tāraka's sons, Tārakākṣa. Kamalā-
<div n="lb"/>kṣa, Vidyunmālī etc. In the furious battle that ensued
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya killed Tārakāsura. The other asura
<div n="lb"/>chiefs too were killed.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Vow of celibacy.%} After the killing of Tārakāsura
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya became the object of too much of petting
<div n="lb"/>by Pārvatī with the result that his life became un-
<div n="lb"/>bridled and wayward. His lust was everyday on the
<div n="lb"/>increase and he committed even rape on Deva women,
<div n="lb"/>who were ultimately forced to complain about him to
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī. Immediately she called Subrahmaṇya to her
<div n="lb"/>and showed her own image in all other women and he
<div n="lb"/>became so much repentant about his past actions that
<div n="lb"/>he took the vow before Pārvatī that in future he would
<div n="lb"/>look upon all women in the world as equal to her, his
<div n="lb"/>mother. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 81).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Marriage.%} See under Devasenā.

<div n="NI"/>(i) On the occasion of the burning of the Khāṇḍava
<div n="lb"/>forest Subrahmaṇya went there carrying his weapon
<div n="lb"/>called ‘Śakti’ to fight Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 226, Verse 33).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Skanda was born from the semen of Śiva which

<div n="lb"/>Indra feared loss of his place and immediately he

<div n="lb"/>hit Skanda on his right and from the wound emerged
<div n="lb"/>a person wearing golden armour, divine ear-rings and
<div n="lb"/>holding the Vel in his hands and he was named

<div n="lb"/>which kills children and the children killed by me will
<div n="lb"/>serve as your food.” As soon as he finished speaking,
<div n="lb"/>a terrible person just like Agni emerged from his body
<div n="lb"/>and it was called Raudragraha, which is known also
<div n="lb"/>by other names such as Skandāpasmāra, Śakunigraha,
<div n="lb"/>Pūtanāgraha etc. This Graha is supposed to cause
<div n="lb"/>children's death. (Vana Parva, Chapter 230).
