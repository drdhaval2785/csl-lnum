MAṄGALA¦. A deity in the form of Kuja or Planet Mars.
<div n="lb"/>There are different versions in the Purāṇas regarding
<div n="lb"/>the birth of Maṅgala.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Satī committed suicide at the Dakṣayāga and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>greatly griefstricken at the loss of his wife started
<div n="lb"/>penance. A sweat drop fell from the forehead of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>doing severe penance and Maṅgala was the son born
<div n="lb"/>of that drop. Śiva then installed Maṅgala among the
<div n="lb"/>Navagrahas and according to the science of astrology
<div n="lb"/>this Graha is considered the protector of the landed
<div n="lb"/>property and the wife of a person. (Śiva Purāṇa, Rudra
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā 1-10 and Skanda Purāṇa 4-1-17).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Śiva married Vikeśī daughter of Hiraṇyākṣa. One
<div n="lb"/>day while they were engaged in sexual plays Agni
<div n="lb"/>came to their presence. Enraged at this the eyes of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>blazed with anger and a drop of hot water from his
<div n="lb"/>eyes fell on the face of Vikeśī and she became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>After some days Vikeśī found it impossible to bear the
<div n="lb"/>embryo of Śiva thus formed and she aborted it. A
<div n="lb"/>child was born and the goddess of earth took it and
[Page477-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>fed it with breast milk. It was that child who later on
<div n="lb"/>became Maṅgala. (Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Maṅgala was born of the blood drops of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Maṅgala was the son of Bharadvāja. (Gaṇeśa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Maṅgala was the son of Bhūmidevī. Devas, sages,
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas, Manus and Gandharvas all worshipped
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmi at the time of Varāhakalpa. It is also said in
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas that Bhūmidevī is the wife of Mahāviṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>incarnation as Varāha. Maṅgala alias the planet Mars
<div n="lb"/>was born to Bhūmidevī of Mahāviṣṇu as Varāha. (9th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha. Devī Bhāgavata).
