DHRUVA¦. I.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and childhood.%} Manu Svāyambhuva the son of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, had two sons named Priyavrata and Uttāna-
<div n="lb"/>pāda. They were mighty heroes and of righteous
<div n="lb"/>character. Uttānapāda had two wives, Suruci and
<div n="lb"/>Sunīti. Suruci gave birth to Uttama and Sunīti to
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva. Uttānapāda showed more favour towards
<div n="lb"/>Uttama and Suruci. But he looked upon Dhruva and
<div n="lb"/>his mother with disfavour.
<div n="NI"/>Once Uttama sat on the lap of his father when the
<div n="lb"/>latter was sitting on the throne. Seeing this, Dhruva
<div n="lb"/>wanted to sit along with his brother. But fearing the
<div n="lb"/>displeasure of Suruci, who was also there, the King did
<div n="lb"/>not take Dhruva on to his lap. Seeing the endeavour of
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva, Suruci said to him, “Child, if you wish to sit
<div n="lb"/>on the lap of your father, you ought to have been born
<div n="lb"/>in my womb. You cherish high ambition which you do
<div n="lb"/>not deserve.” These words of Suruci were not palatable
<div n="lb"/>to Dhruva who ran to his mother and sat on her lap.
<div n="lb"/>When Sunīti knew what had happened she shed tears.
<div n="lb"/>After a few moments Dhruva stood up and made a
<div n="lb"/>vow. “I will get a position unattainable even for my
[Page238-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>father, by my own endeavour.” He then started for the
<div n="lb"/>forest. He attained self-renunciation even in childhood
<div n="lb"/>becoming a disciple of hermits and performing severe
<div n="lb"/>penance.
<div n="NI"/>Dhruva began penance in the forest of Madhuvana on
<div n="lb"/>the river Jamunā. Sunīti came and tried to take him to
<div n="lb"/>the palace. But he did not return. He intensified his pena-
<div n="lb"/>nce more and more. At last Mahāviṣṇu appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him. Dhruva requested for a lofty, and eternal place
<div n="lb"/>which would become a prop of the world. Accordingly,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu pointed out to Dhruva, a noble place, higher
<div n="lb"/>than the planets, stars Saptarṣis (Ursa Major) and the
<div n="lb"/>devas who travelled in aeroplanes. Mahāviṣṇu said
<div n="lb"/>that Dhruva would live in a lofty place as a star till
<div n="lb"/>the end of the Kalpa and his mother Sunīti would also
<div n="lb"/>remain as a star near Śiva as long as Dhruva lived
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapters 11 and 12).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The previous birth of Dhruva.%} Mahāviṣṇu appeared
<div n="lb"/>before Dhruva and revealed his previous birth.
<div n="NI"/>Dhruva was a Brahmin in his previous birth. He used
<div n="lb"/>to meditate on Viṣṇu with concentration of mind. In
<div n="lb"/>course of time he befriended a prince who was a youth,
<div n="lb"/>of beautiful and bright complexion, enjoying all the
<div n="lb"/>pleasures of the world. Attracted by the position and
<div n="lb"/>status of the prince, the Brahmin wanted to become a
<div n="lb"/>prince. Mahāviṣṇu granted his wish. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva took his next birth as the son of Uttānapāda.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The reign and end of Dhruva.%} After receiving the boon
<div n="lb"/>from Mahāviṣṇu, Dhruva returned. All who were there
<div n="lb"/>embraced Dhruva. Years passed by. Uttānapāda left
<div n="lb"/>his kingdom to Dhruva and became a forest house-
<div n="lb"/>holder. Dhruva became King. The King Dhruva
<div n="lb"/>married Brāhmī, the daughter of Śiśumāra a Prajāpati.
<div n="lb"/>The queen gave birth to two sons Kalpa and Vatsara.
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva married Ilā the daughter of Vāyu (wind). She
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to a son named Utkala.
<div n="NI"/>Uttama remained unmarried. While he was hunting in
<div n="lb"/>the forest a Yakṣa (a demi-god) killed him. Suruci was
<div n="lb"/>caught in wild fire and died. Hearing about the death
<div n="lb"/>of Uttama, Dhruva took his weapons and reached the
<div n="lb"/>realm of the Yakṣas. He stood at their gate and
<div n="lb"/>challenged them for battle. One lac and thirty thousand
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣa warriors fought with Dhruva. Dhruva destroyed
<div n="lb"/>the entire army. The Yakṣas began illusive and
<div n="lb"/>magical arts. Dhruva overcame that also. At last
<div n="lb"/>Kubera himself appeared before Dhruva and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him. They got him into a plane and placed him in a
<div n="lb"/>place higher than all the planets. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The descendants of Dhruva.%} Two sons named Śiṣṭi and
<div n="lb"/>Bhavya were born to Dhruva by his wife Śambhu.
<div n="lb"/>Succhāyā the wife of Śiṣṭi gave birth to five sinless sons
<div n="lb"/>named Ripu, Ripuñjaya, Vipra, Vṛkala and Vṛkatejas.
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhatī the wife of Ripu gave birth to Cākṣuṣa of extreme
<div n="lb"/>bright complexion. Manu was born to Cākṣuṣa by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Puṣkaraṇī the daughter of Vīraṇaprajāpati and in-
<div n="lb"/>cluded in the children of Varuṇa. Ten sons were born
<div n="lb"/>to the bright Manu by his wife Naḍvalā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Prajāpati Vairāja. These ten bright sons were Kuru,
<div n="lb"/>Pūru, Śatadyumna Tapasvī, Satyavān, Śuci, Agniṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭomā, Atirātra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. Āgneyī,
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Kuru gave birth to six children.
<div n="lb"/>They were Aṅga, Sumanas, Khyāti, Kratu, Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>and Śibi. A son named Vena was born to Aṅga
[Page239-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Sunīthā. Hermits churned the right hand
<div n="lb"/>of Vena to obtain children. As a result of churning
<div n="lb"/>Vaineya was born from the right hand of Vena. That
<div n="lb"/>King is the famous Pṛthu. This Pṛthu milked the earth
<div n="lb"/>for the prosperity of his subjects. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa
<div n="lb"/>1, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The place of Dhruva.%} The origin of the river Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>was through the hole at the top of the shell of the
<div n="lb"/>mundane egg. It flowed down and fell on the highest
<div n="lb"/>part of heaven. That place is called Viṣṇupāda. Sitting
<div n="lb"/>in this Viṣṇupāda, Dhruva does penance to Viṣṇu. So
<div n="lb"/>this place got the name Dhruvamaṇḍala. (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 8).
