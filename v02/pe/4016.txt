LOKĀLOKA¦. There is a mountain between Loka and
<div n="lb"/>Aloka. This is called Lokālokaparvata and the land
<div n="lb"/>beside it is called Lokāloka. The mountain is as long
<div n="lb"/>as the distance between Mānasottara and Mahāmeru.
<div n="lb"/>This place is golden in colour and as smooth as glass.
<div n="lb"/>Not a single being lives there. God has created this as
<div n="lb"/>a boundary to the three worlds. All the planets like
<div n="lb"/>the Sun get light from the brilliance of this mountain.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā has posted four diggajas named Vṛṣabha,
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpacūḍa, Vāmana and Aparājita in the four corners
<div n="lb"/>of this mountain. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
