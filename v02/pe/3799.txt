KUMĀRĪPŪJĀ¦. It is a special item in Navarātripūjā.
<div n="lb"/>According to the definition ‘Kumārikā tu sā proktā
<div n="lb"/>dvivarṣā yā bhavediha,’ Kumārī is a two-year old
<div n="lb"/>female child. To worship such a child is Kumarīpūjā,
<div n="lb"/>and it should be conducted accompanied by sumptuous
<div n="lb"/>feasts and presentation of clothes etc. There are no
<div n="lb"/>hard and fast rules as to how many Kumārīs should
<div n="lb"/>be worshipped and as to the manner and method of
<div n="lb"/>the worship. The same Kumārī may be worshipped
<div n="lb"/>during all the days of the Pūjā, or every day one more
<div n="lb"/>girl may be worshipped like this:—one girl on the first
<div n="lb"/>day, two on the second day and so on. Or it may be
<div n="lb"/>in the order 4, 6, 8 etc or 4, 8, 12, 16 etc. Even if
<div n="lb"/>the daily number be nine it is in order. There is no
<div n="lb"/>rule that Kumārīs alone should be worshipped; any one
<div n="lb"/>of the navakanyakās would do. A girl two years
<div n="lb"/>old is called Kumārī, three years old Trimūrti; four
<div n="lb"/>years old Kalyāṇī; five years old Rohiṇī; six years old
<div n="lb"/>Kālī; Seven years old Caṇḍikā; eight years old Śāmb-
<div n="lb"/>havī; nine years old Durgā and ten years old Subhadrā.
<div n="lb"/>These girls are called Navakanyakās. But, a child less
<div n="lb"/>than two years of age should not be worshipped, because
<div n="lb"/>it will not be fully sensitive to taste, smell etc. Also,
<div n="lb"/>age alone does not render Kumārīs suitable for worship.
<div n="lb"/>They should be absolutely free from ulcers, leprosy,
<div n="lb"/>ugliness, squint-eyes, dwarfishness, lameness, bad
<div n="lb"/>odour, stigma of low birth etc. For the achievement of
<div n="lb"/>special objects a Brahmin child should be worshipped;
<div n="lb"/>for victory, a Kṣatriya child and for profit, a Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>or a Sūdra child should be worshipped. The Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>may worship brahmin childern; the Kṣatriya, Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>and Kṣatriya children; the Vaiśya, Brahmin, Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>and Vaiśya children; and the Śūdra, Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra children. (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, 3rd Skandha).
