UTSAVA¦. Celebrations conducted in temples from
<div n="lb"/>olden days. There are Śāstraic (scriptural) injunctions
<div n="lb"/>as regards conducting utsavas. Utsava is an indispens-
<div n="lb"/>able celebration when once the deity (idol) is in-
<div n="lb"/>stalled in the temple. Utsava should be celebrated for
<div n="lb"/>one day, three days or seven days in the very same
<div n="lb"/>month in which the deity was installed, because non-
<div n="lb"/>celebration of Utsava will render the installation in-
<div n="lb"/>effective. Utsava should be conducted either during
<div n="lb"/>Uttarāyaṇa (movement of the sun from south to North)
<div n="lb"/>or Viṣu (when the Sun is in the centre) or at a time
<div n="lb"/>suitable to the temple authorities who conduct the
<div n="lb"/>utsava in Śayana, Upavana or Gṛha. It should com-
<div n="lb"/>mence with auspicious ceremonies like the sowing of
<div n="lb"/>seeds of nine varieties of foodgrains, and with dance,
<div n="lb"/>song, instrumental music etc.
