PUṢKARAMĀLINĪ¦. A very virtuous woman. She was
<div n="lb"/>the wife of a sage named Satya who lived on alms in
<div n="lb"/>the country of Vidarbha. Because she was very strict and
<div n="lb"/>perfect in the observance of vratas she became lean
<div n="lb"/>but pure. She was very obedient to her husband and
<div n="lb"/>she made her own dress out of peacock feathers gather-
<div n="lb"/>ed from forests. Puṣkaramālinī was against sacrificing
<div n="lb"/>cows in yajñas. (Chapter 246, Śānti Parva).
