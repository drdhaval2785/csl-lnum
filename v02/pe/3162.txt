KĀLIYA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of
<div n="lb"/>Marīci begot of his wife Kadrū powerful nāgas like
<div n="lb"/>Śeṣa, Airāvata, Takṣaka, Kārkoṭaka, Kāliya, Maṇi-
<div n="lb"/>nāga, Purāṇanāga etc. and from them were born all
<div n="lb"/>kinds of nāgas on earth. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 35).
<div n="lb"/>Kāliya possessed one thousand heads. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kāliya took his abode in Kālindī.%} Vinatā and Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>were wives of Kaśyapa. The former was the mother
<div n="lb"/>of Garuḍa and the latter of the nāgas. In a wager
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā was defeated and had to become the slave of
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū. Garuḍa brought Amṛta from Devaloka and
<div n="lb"/>redeemed his mother from slavery. Yet Garuḍa and
<div n="lb"/>the nāgas continued to be enemies, Garuḍa killing and
<div n="lb"/>eating nāgas whenever he got a chance for it. At last the
<div n="lb"/>nāgas entered into an understanding with Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>agreeing to give him the havis (offering) which they
<div n="lb"/>got on certain days, and thus Garuḍa stopped eating
<div n="lb"/>the nāgas. But Kāliya did not subscribe to the above
<div n="lb"/>agreement; he treated Garuḍa with contempt. But, in
<div n="lb"/>an encounter with Garuḍa Kāliya was put to so much
<div n="lb"/>of hardships that he, along with his family, shifted his
<div n="lb"/>residence to a particular sector in Kālindī.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Admission denied to Garuḍa.%} Owing to the curse of
<div n="lb"/>a sage called Saubhari, who was performing penance on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of Kālindī, that Garuḍa would die broken-
<div n="lb"/>headed if he entered Kālindī, it was a prohibited area
<div n="lb"/>to Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Suppression of Kāliya.%} Owing to the virulent poison
<div n="lb"/>of Kāliya the waters of Kālindī became poisonous and
<div n="lb"/>the trees on its banks dried up. Once, while Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and his companions, the Gopālas came to the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the river grazing their cows. The Gopālas drank water
<div n="lb"/>from the river and fell down dead. Then Kṛṣṇa jump-
<div n="lb"/>ed into the river from the top of a tree on its bank and
<div n="lb"/>danced upon the hoods of Kāliya who had rushed to
[Page376-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>attack him. Kāliya vomited blood and saluted Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>His wives and children also saluted the Lord. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>sent all of them away to Ramaṇaka island assuring
<div n="lb"/>Kāliya that Garuḍa would not attack him on seeing the
<div n="lb"/>marks of his (Kṛṣṇa's) feet on Kāliya. Thus did
<div n="lb"/>Kāliya and his family shift their residence to Rama-
<div n="lb"/>ṇaka island. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
