MALAYAPRABHA¦. A King celebrated in Purāṇas. He
<div n="lb"/>ruled over Kurukṣetra. Once when there was a famine
<div n="lb"/>in the land, King Malayaprabha exempted his subjects
<div n="lb"/>from all taxes. The greedy ministers did not like it and
[Page472-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>they advised him against it. The King yielded to the
<div n="lb"/>advice of his ministers. On one occasion Malayaprabha's
<div n="lb"/>son Induprabha pleaded with his father and told him
<div n="lb"/>that he should not oppress his subjects at the instigation
<div n="lb"/>of his evil ministers. He added that the King was their
<div n="lb"/>“Kalpavṛkṣa” and the subjects were his “Kāmadhenus.”
<div n="lb"/>But the King did not heed the advice of his son. He
<div n="lb"/>jokingly said that Induprabha was also their “Kalpa-
<div n="lb"/>vṛkṣa”. Stung by this taunt, Induprabha took a solemn
<div n="lb"/>oath that he would either become a “Kalpavṛkṣa” or
<div n="lb"/>lay down his life in the attempt. He left the palace at
<div n="lb"/>once and began an austere tapas. Indra was pleased and
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him. Receiving his blessing, Induprabha
<div n="lb"/>returned to his capital and stood there as a “Kalpa-
<div n="lb"/>vṛkṣa”. He fulfilled the desires of the people. A few days
<div n="lb"/>later, Indra came to the tree to test Induprabha. He
<div n="lb"/>told Induprabha: “Your mission of service is over; now
<div n="lb"/>you may come to Heaven”. But he insisted that his
<div n="lb"/>subjects also should be taken with him to Heaven. Indra
<div n="lb"/>was pleased at the devotion and love of Induprabha for
<div n="lb"/>his subjects and agreed to take all his subjects also with
<div n="lb"/>him. Induprabha gave up the form of the tree and
<div n="lb"/>resuming his own shape, accepted “Bodhisattvācārya”.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara, Śaśāṅkavatī lambaka, 5th Taraṅga).
