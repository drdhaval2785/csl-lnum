KĀVYAMĀTĀ¦. Mother of Śukra, the preceptor of the
<div n="lb"/>Daityas.
<F>1) Śukra is also known as Kāvya. Certain Purāṇas claim Śukra as the son of Bhṛgu, while certain others refer to him as the son of Kavi
<div n="lb"/>son of Bhṛgu. Pulomā was Bhṛgu's wife. But, the Purāṇas call the mother of Śukra Kāvyamātā. No mention is made about the wife of Kavi
<div n="lb"/>the son of Bhṛgu. Pulomā and Kāvyamātā are different persons. Therefore, Śukra might be the son of Bhṛgu hy another wife, or he might be
<div n="lb"/>the son of Kavi.</F> Kāvyamātā possessed extraordinary powers
<div n="lb"/>of penance. In the Devī Bhāgavata the following story
<div n="lb"/>is given; how she cursed Viṣṇu and how she made
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Indra powerless.
<div n="NI"/>Once a fierce war was fought by the Devas and the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras in which the latter got defeated, and they sought
<div n="lb"/>the help of Śukrācārya. But, as the Devas enjoyed the
<div n="lb"/>support of Viṣṇu, Śukra could not do anything for the
<div n="lb"/>asuras, and he therefore advised them to get on some-
<div n="lb"/>how or other for some time. After that Śukra went to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa and performed penance, hanging head down-
<div n="lb"/>wards, for a thousand years to secure rare and ex-
<div n="lb"/>ceptional mantras. During this period the Devas again
<div n="lb"/>attacked the Asuras, who ran up to Kāvyamātā for
<div n="lb"/>succour, and she, by one glance, sent the Devas to
<div n="lb"/>long sleep. She reduced Viṣṇu and Indra also to a
<div n="lb"/>state of paralysis. Then Viṣṇu meditated upon the
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana Cakra, which arrived immediately and with
<div n="lb"/>the Cakra he cut off Kāvyamātā's head. Sage Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>then appeared on the scene and brought back Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mātā to life, and she, in furious rage cursed that Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>should take many births. As a result of the curse
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu had to incarnate himself on earth many
<div n="lb"/>times. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
