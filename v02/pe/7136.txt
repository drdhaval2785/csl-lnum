ŚUNASSAKHA¦. Indra. Once Indra disguised himself as
<div n="lb"/>a Sannyāsī and travelled in the company of a dog. At
<div n="lb"/>that time, he made an attempt to steal lotus flower
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmasaras in Kauśikī tīrtha. Indra struck down
<div n="lb"/>at a single blow, Yātudhānī, the woman guard of the
<div n="lb"/>saras, who opposed him. From this time when Indra
<div n="lb"/>went about in the company of the dog, he got the name
<div n="lb"/>“Śunassakha”. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 94).
