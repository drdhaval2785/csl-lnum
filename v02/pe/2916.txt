JĀTISMARAKĪṬA¦. A worm which got emancipation
<div n="lb"/>through the advice of Vyāsa. Once while Vyāsa was
<div n="lb"/>roaming about in the country, by chance he saw this
<div n="lb"/>worm. It was running through the road, seeing a cart
<div n="lb"/>coming very fast. Vyāsa stopped it and asked, “What
<div n="lb"/>are you running from?” The worm replied that he
<div n="lb"/>was running in fear that the wheel of the cart coming
<div n="lb"/>from behind might crush him. In the previous birth
<div n="lb"/>this worm was a Śūdra. Jealousy, resentment, arrogance,
<div n="lb"/>selfishness etc. were the traits of his character in his
<div n="lb"/>previous life. Only twice in his life had he done good
[Page352-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>deeds. Once he honoured his mother and on another
<div n="lb"/>occasion he respected a Brāhmaṇa. Because of these
<div n="lb"/>two good deeds, in his present life as worm he had
<div n="lb"/>the remembrance of his previous life. Vyāsa gave the
<div n="lb"/>worm necessary advice. Instantly the worm was crushed
<div n="lb"/>under the wheel of the cart.
<div n="NI"/>In the next rebirth this Jātismarakīṭa was born as a
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya King. As he was leading the life of a powerful
<div n="lb"/>King he met with Vyāsa. He received advice from the
<div n="lb"/>hermit. In his next life he became a Brāhmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>finally he attained bliss. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, 3
<div n="lb"/>Chapters from 117).
