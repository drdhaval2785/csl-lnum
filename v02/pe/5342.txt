PRASENAJIT IV¦. A King who lived in the city of
<div n="lb"/>Śrāvastī. Once a very virtuous brahmin came to this
<div n="lb"/>city. Finding him to be a man of great virtues a Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>took him to his house and kept him there worshipping
<div n="lb"/>him. Many rich men coming to know of the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>came and worshipped him with offerings of costly
<div n="lb"/>clothes and ornaments. Within a short time the poor
<div n="lb"/>brahmin got a huge heap of gold and silver. He collect-
<div n="lb"/>ed his lot and at night without letting anybody know
<div n="lb"/>went and buried it in a secret place in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>After some days he went and looked for it and found
<div n="lb"/>his buried wealth missing. When the brahmin returned
<div n="lb"/>weeping, the host, the Vaiśya, gathered from him all
<div n="lb"/>that had happened. The house-holder consoled him
<div n="lb"/>but the miserly and greedy brahmin was not to be
<div n="lb"/>pacified thus and he started to commit suicide. He
<div n="lb"/>went to a pond nearby and was about to jump into it
<div n="lb"/>when Prasenajit who heard about this came to the
<div n="lb"/>spot and told him thus:—“Do not grieve over your
<div n="lb"/>loss. I shall make enquiries about it and if the stolen
<div n="lb"/>wealth is not recovered I shall give you compensation
<div n="lb"/>from my treasury.”
<div n="NI"/>After consoling the brahmin thus the King went to
<div n="lb"/>his palace. He pretended to be ill and called the
<div n="lb"/>physicians of the city to his side. He asked them about
<div n="lb"/>their patients, their illness and the medicines prescribed
<div n="lb"/>for them. One of the physicians during the enquiry
<div n="lb"/>said thus: “Oh lord, Mātṛdattavaṇik is my patient.
<div n="lb"/>Yesterday I prescribed to him the root of Ūraka
<div n="lb"/>plant.” The King soon dispersed the physicians and
<div n="lb"/>sent for Mātṛdattavaṇik and asked him who had
<div n="lb"/>brought for him the root. When Mātṛdattavaṇik
<div n="lb"/>replied that it was his servant the King sent for the
<div n="lb"/>servant and on questioning the servant the latter
<div n="lb"/>confessed having taken the hidden treasure. Thus
<div n="lb"/>because of the intelligence and wisdom of the King
<div n="lb"/>the brahmin got back his wealth. (Taraṅga 7, Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañcukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
