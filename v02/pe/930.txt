BALLĀLA¦. Son of a Vaiśya named Kalyāṇa. From
<div n="lb"/>childhood Ballāla was an ardent devotee of Gaṇapati.
<div n="lb"/>When he was a child he used to gather pebbles and
<div n="lb"/>make a heap and then worship it, imagining it to be
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇeśa (Gaṇapati).
<div n="NI"/>His parents did not like this. They tried their best to
<div n="lb"/>dissuade him from this habit. Once they tied him to
<div n="lb"/>a tree and gave him severe cuts. But their attempts
<div n="lb"/>were futile. One day an image of Gaṇapati arose in
<div n="lb"/>the place where the child used to worship. (Gaṇeśa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa 1:2).
