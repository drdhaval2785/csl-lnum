NAMMĀLVĀR¦. The first of the twelve great Ālvārs. The
<div n="lb"/>Śaivite devotees of South India are called Nāyanārs and
<div n="lb"/>the Vaisṇavite devotees, Ālvārs. The word ālvār means,
<div n="lb"/>a devotee of God. The Vaiṣṇava religion says that the
<div n="lb"/>twelve ālvārs are the incarnations of Ādiśeṣa and Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>the followers and the embodied deities of the Conch and
<div n="lb"/>the discus the weapons of Viṣṇu. It is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in Śrīmad Bhāgavata that divine persons who are
<div n="lb"/>followers of Viṣṇu will incarnate on the earth in Kali-
<div n="lb"/>yuga and that their native places will be the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the holy rivers in Drāviḍa such as Tāmraparṇī, Kṛtamālā
<div n="lb"/>(Vaigai), Payasvinī (Pāpanāśinī) and Kāverī. It is
<div n="lb"/>stated about these divine persons in Viṣṇumāhātmya
<div n="lb"/>that they would take birth in any caste and compose
<div n="lb"/>Drāviḍa songs and thereby propagate lofty truths. The
<div n="lb"/>collection of Drāviḍa songs thus composed by the
<div n="lb"/>ālvārs is called ‘Divya Prabandha’ (Divine Composi-
<div n="lb"/>tion).
<div n="NI"/>There are four thousand songs in four parts in the
<div n="lb"/>Divine composition and hence it has the name Nālāyira
<div n="lb"/>Prabandham ‘Four thousand composition’. The theme
<div n="lb"/>of the 1st and 2nd thousands is a secret known as
<div n="lb"/>‘Tirumantra’ (the divine spell). The third thousand
<div n="lb"/>is concerned with the “Caramaśloka” (the verse of
<div n="lb"/>death) and in the fourth “Dvayamantra” is dealt with.
<div n="lb"/>The Tirumantra (the divine spell) is the collection of
<div n="lb"/>of three words Om, namaḥ and Nārāyaṇāya.
<div n="NI"/>‘Om’ and ‘namaḥ’ are explained in the first thousand and
<div n="lb"/>the word Nārāyaṇāya in the second thousand of the
<div n="lb"/>composition. The Caramaśloka (the verse of death) is
<div n="lb"/>the last utterance of the songster-priest. It is a propa-
<div n="lb"/>gation of the theme of seeking refuge. The individual
<div n="lb"/>soul has to seek refuge under the universal soul, un-
<div n="lb"/>conditionally. This is what is called ‘Prapatti. Dvaya-
<div n="lb"/>mantra (the two fold mantra) deals with the aim and
<div n="lb"/>the ways for the realisation of that aim. It would be
<div n="lb"/>possible only by the help of Lakṣmī Bhagavatī (the
<div n="lb"/>goddess Lakṣmī). It is a verse of only two lines.
<div n="NI"/>The first and foremost among the ālvārs is Nammālvār.
<div n="lb"/>‘Tiruvāymoli’ is his work. It had been predicted in
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇava Purāṇa that at the beginning of Kaliyuga.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Senānī named Viṣvaksena would incarnate as
<div n="lb"/>Nammālvār and that he would reinstate the Vaiṣṇavite
<div n="lb"/>religion. It is hinted in Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa that
<div n="lb"/>Nammālvār would incarnate in Śrīnagarī (Tirunagari)
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of river Tāmraparṇī in the Kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍya. As was fore-told Nammālvār was born in
<div n="lb"/>Tirunagari. The present name of this place is ‘Ālvār
<div n="lb"/>tirunagari’.
<div n="NI"/>There is a traditional lore about the birth of Nammāl-
<div n="lb"/>vār. There was a ruling chief named Kāriyār in Tiruna-
<div n="lb"/>gari. Udayamaṅkayār was his wife. The couple once
<div n="lb"/>went to the Vaiṣṇavite temple near Mahendra mount-
<div n="lb"/>ain known as Tirukkuruṅkuṭi temple and prayed to the
[Page523-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>god consecrated there called Nambi, for a son. Reply
<div n="lb"/>was given through the priests that the god himself
<div n="lb"/>would take birth as their son. Accordingly Udayamaṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kayār gave birth to Nammālvār. Scholars say that the
<div n="lb"/>birth of Nammālvār was on the 43rd day of Kailyuga-
<div n="lb"/>that is in B.C. 3102.
<div n="NI"/>Nammālvār had another name Parāṅkuśa. Some believe
<div n="lb"/>that he was the incarnation of portions of Seneśa and
<div n="lb"/>the jewel Kaustubha. Some say that there are portions
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu, Pañcāyudha, Ādiśeṣa and Seneśa in
<div n="lb"/>Nammālvār. The Vaiṣṇavites have given Nammālvār a
<div n="lb"/>lofty place. The infant born to Kāriyār and Udayamaṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kayār was not an ordinary one. Generally infants at
<div n="lb"/>birth are covered with a case of air called ‘Śaṭha’.
<div n="lb"/>Because of this they lose the memory of previous birth.
<div n="lb"/>But Nammālvār had no Śaṭha. So he got the name
<div n="lb"/>‘Śaṭhakopa’. The parents were amazed at the infant
<div n="lb"/>which lay still without beating its legs, and crying or
<div n="lb"/>sucking its mother's breasts. The bright infant was taken
<div n="lb"/>to the Vaiṣṇavite temple on the twelfth day. Because
<div n="lb"/>of his difference from ordinary infants he was named
<div n="lb"/>Māra. A golden cradle studded with jewels was hung
<div n="lb"/>on the branch of a tamarind tree and laying the child
<div n="lb"/>in it, the parents went home. That tamarind tree still
<div n="lb"/>stands there. The devotees believe that that tree also is
<div n="lb"/>a portion of Ādiśeṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Nammālvār spent sixteen years under the tamarind tree
<div n="lb"/>without opening the eyes or uttering a single word. In
<div n="lb"/>the sixteenth year a wise man who could understand
<div n="lb"/>the dignity of Nammālvār came there. The person was
<div n="lb"/>the Madhura Kavi Ālvār. After this Nammālvār sat
<div n="lb"/>under the tamarind tree and sang songs of praise of
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa. Madhura Kavi set tunes for them and
<div n="lb"/>sang them. Everybody who heard them was struck with
<div n="lb"/>wonder and stood still. Nammālvār spent his days
<div n="lb"/>under the tamarind tree in meditation and contempla-
<div n="lb"/>tion. At the age of 35 he entered heaven.
