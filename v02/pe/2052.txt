DHYĀNA¦. (Meditation). Even from ancient times the
<div n="lb"/>people of Bhārata believed that heaven could be attain-
<div n="lb"/>ed by meditation. There are scientific methods of
<div n="lb"/>meditating upon God. They are described below:
<div n="NI"/>The root “dhyai”, means “to think”. Dhyāna (medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation) means thinking of God with concentration.
<div n="lb"/>God is invisible and figureless. We can meditate only
<div n="lb"/>upon some material that contains the attributes of God.
<div n="lb"/>So dhyāna (meditation) is to fix the mind on the
<div n="lb"/>object of meditation, and to imagine that particular
<div n="lb"/>object in a particular place and to concentrate the
<div n="lb"/>mind upon it. One who casts off his body, while engag-
<div n="lb"/>ed in meditation attains ‘Sāyujya’ (oneness with God).

<div n="NI"/>He who can meditate upon God, with concentration
<div n="lb"/>of mind even for a moment or two can attain heaven.
<div n="lb"/>The fruits he attains are far greater than the fruits
<div n="lb"/>attained by performing great sacrifices and offerings.
<div n="lb"/>For meditation, there are four factors: Dhyātā (the
<div n="lb"/>meditator), Dhyāna (the act of meditation) Dhyeya
<div n="lb"/>(the object meditated upon) and Dhyānaprayojana
<div n="lb"/>(the attainment by meditation). He who indulges in
<div n="lb"/>meditation is the meditator. The act done by him is
<div n="lb"/>meditation. That which is meditated upon is the object
<div n="lb"/>of meditation. What the meditator obtains as a result
<div n="lb"/>of his meditation is the attainment. A meditator should
<div n="lb"/>be wise and virtuous, should have attention and patie-
<div n="lb"/>nce, devoted to Viṣṇu and always energetic.
<div n="NI"/>We can meditate upon God, walking, standing, sleeping
<div n="lb"/>and awake. God should be consecrated in the centre of
<div n="lb"/>the lotus chair of the heart and be worshipped with de-
<div n="lb"/>votional meditation. It is to give practice in fixing the
<div n="lb"/>mind firmly on a particular object, that the sages say
<div n="lb"/>that some visible material object should be given to
<div n="lb"/>meditate upon, in the early stage of meditation. When
<div n="lb"/>concentration of mind is obtained by meditating upon
<div n="lb"/>a visible object, it will be possible for us to meditate
<div n="lb"/>upon an object which is not amenable to our senses.
<div n="lb"/>When engaged in meditation we should be thinking
<div n="lb"/>“Ahaṃ Brahmā jyotirātmā vāsudevo vimukta Oṃ”. (I
<div n="lb"/>am Brahmā, the light, the Spirit, Vāsudeva, and Vimukta
<div n="lb"/>(having no connection with anything), OM). (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 374).
