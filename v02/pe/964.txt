BHADRĀ VI¦. There is reference to another Bhadrā,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Soma in Chapter 154 of the Anuśāsana Parva.
<div n="lb"/>She once did intense penance to secure Utathya as her
<div n="lb"/>husband. Atri maharṣi, father of Soma, came to know of
<div n="lb"/>the desire of his granddaughter, and got her married
<div n="lb"/>to Utathya. Varuṇa once fell in love with Bhadrā, who
<div n="lb"/>was an exceptionally beautiful woman, and abducted
<div n="lb"/>and concealed her in the sea. When Utathya returned
<div n="lb"/>to the Āśrama, his wife was missing. He understood
<div n="lb"/>what had happened to Bhadrā by the light of his divine
<div n="lb"/>knowledge (television of mind). Burning with anger
<div n="lb"/>he drank up the sea completely dry, and Varuṇa shud-
<div n="lb"/>dering with fear returned Bhadrā to Utathya and pro-
<div n="lb"/>fusely apologised. Thus ended the problem.
