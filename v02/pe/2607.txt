<div n="lb"/>for the sake of truth he gifted away the whole of his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom to Viśvāmitra. When that was not sufficient
<div n="lb"/>he cleared his debts to Viśvāmitra with the money got
<div n="lb"/>by selling his wife, Candramatī, his son, Lohitāśva and
<div n="lb"/>finally himself. And, he earned his livelihood with the
<div n="lb"/>wages he got for cremating corpses, himself doing
<div n="lb"/>duties as guard at a burning ghat and as the slave to a
<div n="lb"/>Cāṇḍāla. Ultimately the Trimūrtis (Brahmā, Viṣṇu and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva) appeared and heaped on him all the boons he
<div n="lb"/>desired and rewarded him with high honours. (See for
<div n="lb"/>details para 4 under Viśvāmitra).
