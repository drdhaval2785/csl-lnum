MAKARADAṂṢṬRĀ¦. A prostitute of Mathurā, the birth
<div n="lb"/>place of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The story of this woman who had
<div n="lb"/>made prostitution and cheating her aim in life was told
<div n="lb"/>to Vāsavadattā wife of Udayana by Vasantaka. The
<div n="lb"/>curbing of the arrogance of Makaradaṃṣṭrā by a poor
<div n="lb"/>brahmin of name Lohajaṅgha with the help of Vibhīṣaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>emperor of the demons, is the theme of the story.
<div n="NI"/>Makaradaṃṣṭrā had a daughter named Rūpiṇikā.
<div n="lb"/>The mother tried to make the daughter also a prostitute.
<div n="lb"/>Once Rūpiṇikā went to a far-off temple for worship as
<div n="lb"/>instructed by her mother. There she met a poor brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Lohajaṅgha and Rūpiṇikā was attracted to
<div n="lb"/>him by his handsome features. She sent word through
<div n="lb"/>her maid requesting Lohajaṅgha to come to her house.
<div n="lb"/>Rūpiṇikā came back and waited for her lover to come.
<div n="lb"/>After some time Lohajaṅgha came. Makaradaṃṣṭrā
<div n="lb"/>scrutinised the new-comer with suspicion but Rūpiṇikā
<div n="lb"/>took him to her bed-room. Both of them remained
<div n="lb"/>there making love. Makaradaṃṣṭrā finding her daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter going against the principles of a prostitute called her
<div n="lb"/>to her side and said: “Dear daughter, why do you keep
<div n="lb"/>this poor brahmin? Is this the duty of a prostitute?
<div n="lb"/>Love and prostitution never go together. We are like
<div n="lb"/>dusk. The twilight of love remains for a few seconds
<div n="lb"/>only. So do send away this brahmin who has no
<div n="lb"/>money.”
<div n="NI"/>Rūpiṇikā discarded the advice of her mother and
<div n="lb"/>Makaradaṃṣṭrā felt annoyed. She decided to send out
<div n="lb"/>Lohajaṅgha somehow. One day a prince came that
<div n="lb"/>way and Makaradaṃṣṭrā enticed him to her house and
<div n="lb"/>requested the prince to accept Rūpiṇikā and send
<div n="lb"/>Lohajaṅgha out of her house.
<div n="NI"/>The prince accepted the request of the mother-prosti-
<div n="lb"/>tute. At that time Rūpiṇikā had gone to the temple
[Page470-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and Lohajaṅgha for a walk. After some time Lohajaṅgha
<div n="lb"/>came as usual and entered the house. and Makara-
<div n="lb"/>daṃṣṭrā introduced Lohajaṅgha to the prince. At once
<div n="lb"/>the servants of the prince beat Lohajaṅgha and carrying
<div n="lb"/>him away out of the house put him in an excrement pit.
<div n="lb"/>Lohajaṅgha somehow escaped from there and ran away.
<div n="lb"/>He was sorry to part with his love and he went on a
<div n="lb"/>pilgrimage. He walked for a long distance in the hot
<div n="lb"/>sun and feeling tired searched for a shady place to take
<div n="lb"/>some rest. Then he saw the carcass of an elephant.
<div n="lb"/>Jackals entering through the buttocks had eaten all
<div n="lb"/>flesh and the animal lay hollow inside with the skin in
<div n="lb"/>tact on the skeleton. Lohajaṅgha entered the inside
<div n="lb"/>of the elephant and slept there. That night it rained
<div n="lb"/>heavily and the hole at the buttocks contracted with
<div n="lb"/>little space for Lohajaṅgha to get out. The rains continu-
<div n="lb"/>ed, the water-level in the river Gaṅgā rose and soon
<div n="lb"/>the carcass of the elephant was carried away to the
<div n="lb"/>river and it gradually reached the ocean. At that time
<div n="lb"/>a great kite taking it to be flesh for food drew it up and
<div n="lb"/>took it to the other side of the ocean. When it pecked
<div n="lb"/>it open it found a man inside and frightened
<div n="lb"/>left it there and flew away. By this time Lohajaṅgha
<div n="lb"/>awoke from his slumber and while he was looking
<div n="lb"/>around him in surprise he saw two demons approaching
<div n="lb"/>him. The demons thought he had come to the place
<div n="lb"/>crossing the ocean like Śrī Rāma to bring disaster
<div n="lb"/>to them and so they immediately ran up to Vibhīṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and told him of the incident. Vibhīṣaṇa asked his ser-
<div n="lb"/>vants to bring Lohajaṅgha before him and when he
<div n="lb"/>was brought before him enquired very politely who he
<div n="lb"/>was and why he had come there and how he had come.
<div n="lb"/>In reply to the enquiries Lohajaṅgha said thus: “I am
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin from Mathurā. I did penance to please
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu to get relief from my poverty and one day Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>appeared before me in person and said, ‘Go to my
<div n="lb"/>devotee Vibhīṣaṇa, and he will give you enough wealth
<div n="lb"/>to live happily’. It was in a dream and when I awoke
<div n="lb"/>I found myself on this shore. I do not know how it all
<div n="lb"/>happened.”
<div n="NI"/>Vibḥīṣaṇa was immensely pleased to hear the story of
<div n="lb"/>Lohajaṅgha and gave him immense wealth including
<div n="lb"/>many precious diamonds, golden replica of the emblem
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu consisting of Śaṅkha, Cakra, Gadā and
<div n="lb"/>Padma and a small kite from the mountain of Svarṇa-
<div n="lb"/>mūla. Accepting all these Lohajaṅgha flew on the back of
<div n="lb"/>the kite back to Mathurā and alighted at a deserted place
<div n="lb"/>there. Keeping all his valuable articles in a secret place
<div n="lb"/>he took one diamond and selling it acquired some cash
<div n="lb"/>and with that purchased some ornamental dress for
<div n="lb"/>himself. At dusk he dressed himself and holding the
<div n="lb"/>emblem of Viṣṇu flew on the back of the kite to the
<div n="lb"/>house of Rūpiṇikā and addressing Rūpiṇikā in private
<div n="lb"/>said, “I am Viṣṇu. I have come to you for a
<div n="lb"/>union because you are virtuous”. Hearing that Rūpiṇikā
<div n="lb"/>respectfully surrendered herself to him. Before dawn
<div n="lb"/>Lohajaṅgha left the house and flew back to the desert-
<div n="lb"/>ed place. Rūpiṇikā felt herself to be a goddess and
<div n="lb"/>did not speak to anybody in the morning. The mother
<div n="lb"/>was perplexed to find her daughter observing a vow of
<div n="lb"/>silence and questioned her. Rūpiṇikā then told her
<div n="lb"/>mother all that had happened on the previous night.
<div n="lb"/>Makaradaṃṣṭrā wanted to confirm the story of her
<div n="lb"/>daughter and so she kept awake that night to see what
<div n="lb"/>took place. She found Lohajaṅgha arriving as Viṣṇu
[Page470-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>on the back of Garuḍa and fully believing him to be
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu was overjoyed at the fortune of her daughter
<div n="lb"/>and running to her the next morning said “Oh,
<div n="lb"/>dear daughter, by the grace of Śrī Nārāyaṇa you
<div n="lb"/>have become a goddess. How fortunate am I? You
<div n="lb"/>should do one thing for me. You must send me to
<div n="lb"/>heaven with this body of mine along with your husband-
<div n="lb"/>god.”
<div n="NI"/>Rūpiṇikā agreed to do so. That night she told the fake
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu the desire of her mother. Then Lohajaṅgha said:
<div n="lb"/>“Your mother who is a great sinner is not eligible to go
<div n="lb"/>to Svarga in her present state. Day after tomorrow
<div n="lb"/>on the Dvādaśī day the gates of heaven will open.
<div n="lb"/>Early morning on that day the goblins of Śiva would
<div n="lb"/>enter Svarga. I shall then try to send your mother
<div n="lb"/>along with them. But your mother should then appear
<div n="lb"/>as a goblin. The hair on the head should be shaved at
<div n="lb"/>five places and the remaining hair locked to form five
<div n="lb"/>tufts of hair. She should wear a garland of bones and
<div n="lb"/>the body should be painted black on one side with char-
<div n="lb"/>coal and red on the other side with saffron. The painting
<div n="lb"/>should be in oil and she should not wear any clothes.
<div n="lb"/>This would make her appear like a goblin of Maheśvara
<div n="lb"/>(Śiva) and then there will be no difficulty for me to allow
<div n="lb"/>her to enter Svarga.
<div n="NI"/>Lohajaṅgha left the place early in the morning and
<div n="lb"/>Rūpiṇikā told her mother all that her husband told
<div n="lb"/>her. Makaradaṃṣṭrā dressed herself as instructed by
<div n="lb"/>Lohajaṅgha and awaited the arrival of the fake Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. Lohajaṅgha came at night and Rūpiṇikā
<div n="lb"/>showed him her mother dressed as desired by her
<div n="lb"/>husband. Lohajaṅgha took Makaradaṃṣṭrā on the
<div n="lb"/>back of his kite and flew up. As he rose high he saw a
<div n="lb"/>tall flagstaff of a temple nearby. It had a wheel on its
<div n="lb"/>top. Lohajaṅgha placed her on the wheel and said,
<div n="lb"/>“Do sit here for a while. I shall soon come back to
<div n="lb"/>you and bless you”. To the people assembled in
<div n="lb"/>the temple he spoke from the air, “Citizens, today the
<div n="lb"/>goddess ‘Mārī’, destroyer of everything, will fall on
<div n="lb"/>you. If you want to avoid that, remain in this
<div n="lb"/>temple and worship Viṣṇu”.
<div n="NI"/>People were frightened when they heard the warning
<div n="lb"/>from air and all remained in the temple chanting pra-
<div n="lb"/>yers and reciting devotional songs about Viṣṇu. Makara-
<div n="lb"/>daṃṣṭrā sat there for a while dreaming about the hap-
<div n="lb"/>piness in store for her in Svarga and awaiting her
<div n="lb"/>daughter's husband to come and take her. But Loha-
<div n="lb"/>jaṅgha had come to the temple in an ordinary dress
<div n="lb"/>and was with the crowd in the temple. Time dragged
<div n="lb"/>on and it became midnight and Makaradaṃṣṭrā sitting
<div n="lb"/>on the wheel of the flagstaff felt uneasy. She could not
<div n="lb"/>sit there any longer and she cried aloud, “Oh, I am fal-
<div n="lb"/>ling”. People mistook her for Mārī and cried back, “Oh,
<div n="lb"/>goddess, do not fall”. It became morning and in the
<div n="lb"/>sunlight they saw a figure sitting on the top of the flag-
<div n="lb"/>staff and were surprised. The King was informed and he
<div n="lb"/>came to the temple and so also all people from the place.
<div n="lb"/>When the people on scrutinising the figure knew it was
<div n="lb"/>Makaradaṃṣṭrā, they all clapped their hands laughing
<div n="lb"/>loudly. Hearing the news Rūpiṇikā also came to the
<div n="lb"/>temple and she somehow got her mother down from the
<div n="lb"/>flagstaff. The King then made the prostitute tell her story
<div n="lb"/>and when it was finished he declared thus: “Who has
<div n="lb"/>thus played fraud on this prostitute who had throughout
<div n="lb"/>her life cheated other people? If he comes before me
[Page471-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>now I will give him my crown and Kingdom”. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>that Lohajaṅgha appeared before the King and con-
<div n="lb"/>fessed that he had done the mischief. He then narrated
<div n="lb"/>his story to the king and placed before the king the
<div n="lb"/>golden Seal of Visnu's emblem which Vibhīṣaṇa had
<div n="lb"/>given him. The king as per his promise gave Loha-
<div n="lb"/>jaṅgha his kingdom and Rūpiṇikā once more became
<div n="lb"/>his. The arrogance of Makaradaṃṣṭṛā was thus curbed.
