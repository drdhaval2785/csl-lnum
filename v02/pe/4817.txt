NĪLĀ¦. II. A Gopikā. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was one day picnicking
<div n="lb"/>in Vṛndāvana with the Gopī women, and they were
<div n="lb"/>proud that he was mad after them. To dispel their
<div n="lb"/>pride Kṛṣṇa disappeared abruptly from their midst and
<div n="lb"/>sported with the woman called Nīlā. Then she also
<div n="lb"/>became proud that Kṛṣṇa loved her more than the
<div n="lb"/>others, and she asked him to carry her on his shoulders.
<div n="lb"/>He stood there ready stretching his neck to carry her.
<div n="lb"/>But, when she stood with her legs parted to mount on
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's neck and looked for him he was missing; he had
<div n="lb"/>already disappeared. The Gopikās ultimately shed
<div n="lb"/>their pride and then Kṛṣṇa appeared before them.
<div n="lb"/>(Ceruśśeri's Malayālam Epic Kṛṣṇa Gāthā).
