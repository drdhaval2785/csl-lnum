NANDABHADRA¦. A righteous Vaiśya. Having been
<div n="lb"/>childless for a long time this Vaiśya, who was an ardent
<div n="lb"/>devotee of God Kapileśvara, got a son in his old age.
<div n="lb"/>But he died after his marriage. With this calamity
<div n="lb"/>Nandabhadra became a man of abstinence and began
<div n="lb"/>to try to acquire spiritual knowledge. After a while a
<div n="lb"/>seven-year-old boy appeared before the Vaiśya and
<div n="lb"/>quenched his thirst for spiritual knowledge. Later with
<div n="lb"/>meditation on Śiva and the Sun, Nandabhadra attained
<div n="lb"/>heaven. (Skanda Purāṇa, Chapters 1, 2 and 46).
