NANDAGOPA¦. Foster-father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Previous birth.%} There are two stories about the
<div n="lb"/>previous birth of Nandagopa.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Droṇa, one of the eight Vasus and his wife Dhārā
<div n="lb"/>once committed a mistake, not becoming the gods.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā who found it out, cursed the couple to take
<div n="lb"/>birth in the family of cowherds. Droṇa and Dhārā
<div n="lb"/>prayed for remission. Brahmā told them that Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu would incarnate as their son as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>that after that birth they would be liberated from the
<div n="lb"/>curse. Accordingly Droṇa took birth as Nandagopa and
<div n="lb"/>Dhārā as Yaśodā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once a King named Candrasena sat in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>kāla temple in Ujjayinī to perform penance. Śiva was
<div n="lb"/>pleased at his penance and gave him a jewel. That
<div n="lb"/>brilliant precious stone fulfilled all his desires. Other
<div n="lb"/>kings heard about this jewel and came to war to take
<div n="lb"/>possession of the jewel. The King came and took
<div n="lb"/>refuge in the temple.
<div n="NI"/>At this time a son named Śrīkara was born to a cow-
<div n="lb"/>herdess in Ujjayinī. He was god-fearing since childhood.
<div n="lb"/>Śrīkara came to Mahākāla temple and sat in worship
<div n="lb"/>and meditation and attained the goodwill of Śiva. The
<div n="lb"/>Kings who came in chase of Candrasena could not
<div n="lb"/>approach the temple because of the unearthly brilliance
<div n="lb"/>that radiated from Śrīkara. Not knowing the reason the
<div n="lb"/>kings stood staring and Hanūmān instantly appeared
<div n="lb"/>before them and said. “Hear this, oh Kings! Śrīkara
<div n="lb"/>is not a mere cowherd boy. The God is pleased with
<div n="lb"/>him. In his eighth birth from today he will be born in
<div n="lb"/>Ambāḍi under the name Nandagopa. Then Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>will incarnate as the son of Nandagopa under the name
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa.”
<div n="NI"/>Nandagopa was the eighth birth of this Śrīkara. (Śiva
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Śanipradoṣamāhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Varuṇa carried away Nandagopa.%} While Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was living in Ambāḍi as the foster-son of Nandagopa,
<div n="lb"/>Nandagopa went to bathe in the river Yamunā. While
<div n="lb"/>he was taking a dip under the water a servant of
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa carried him away to the realm of Varuṇa. As
<div n="lb"/>Nandagopa disappeared the people of Ambāḍi ran
<div n="lb"/>here and there in grief. At last Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped into
<div n="lb"/>the water and reached the city of Varuṇa, who praised
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and said that it was to see Śrī Kṛṣṇa that he
<div n="lb"/>had carried Nandagopa away, and requested for
<div n="lb"/>pardon. Śrī Kṛṣṇa pardoned Varuṇa and brought
<div n="lb"/>Nandagopa to Ambāḍi. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nandagopa swallowed by a great mountain-snake.%} (See
<div n="lb"/>under Kṛṣṇa, Para 21).
