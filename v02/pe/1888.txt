DEVAYĀNĪ¦. Sukrācārya's daughter.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Svāyambhuvamanu, son of Brahmā had two
<div n="lb"/>sons: Priyavrata and Uttānapāda. Priyavrata wedded
<div n="lb"/>Surūpā and Barhiṣmatī, two very beautiful daughters
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvakarmaprajāpati, and he had by Surūpā ten
<div n="lb"/>sons called Agnīdhra, Idhmajihvā, Yajñabāhu,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāvīra, Rukmasukra, Ghṛtapṛṣṭha, Savana, Medhā-
<div n="lb"/>tithi, Vītihotra and Kavi as also a daughter called
<div n="lb"/>Ūrjasvatī who was the youngest of the whole lot. Of
<div n="lb"/>the above ten sons Kavi, Savana and Mahāvīra were
<div n="lb"/>spiritual giants and great sages. Uttama, Tāpasa and
<div n="lb"/>Raivata, the three sons of Priyavrata by his second wife
<div n="lb"/>Barhiṣmatī turned out to be manvantarādhipatis.
<div n="lb"/>Ūrjasvatī, the only daughter of Priyavrata was married
<div n="lb"/>to Śukrācārya, preceptor of the asuras. Devayānī was
<div n="lb"/>Śukrācārya's daughter by Ūrjasvatī. (Devībhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse by Kaca.%} Kaca, son of Bṛhaspati became
<div n="lb"/>Śukrācārya's disciple to learn Mṛtasañjīvanī vidyā
<div n="lb"/>(the science to ward off death for ever). Devayānī
<div n="lb"/>fell madly in love with Kaca. But, after his studies
<div n="lb"/>under her father were over Kaca returned to devaloka
<div n="lb"/>without marrying Devayānī, who cursed that Kaca's
[Page215-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>learning should prove useless. And, Kaca cursed her
<div n="lb"/>in return that nobody from devaloka should marry
<div n="lb"/>her. (For details see Kaca).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Devayānī in a neglected well.%} Once Vṛṣaparvan was the
<div n="lb"/>king of the asuras, and Śukrācārya lived in his palace.
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of the king and Devayānī, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Śukrācārya became thick friends. While
<div n="lb"/>one day these two friends with their companions were
<div n="lb"/>engaged in water sports Indra came that way. Very
<div n="lb"/>much interested in seeing the deva damsels thus engaged
<div n="lb"/>in water sports Indra assumed the form of air and blew
<div n="lb"/>off the dresses of the damsels from the shore while they
<div n="lb"/>were playing in the river. The damsels hurriedly got
<div n="lb"/>out of water, ran after the fleeing garments and put
<div n="lb"/>on whatever came to their hands. In the confusion what
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā got and wore was Devayānī's clothes. Devayānī
<div n="lb"/>ran after Śarmiṣṭhā and caught hold of the clothes, but
<div n="lb"/>the latter did not yield them to her. Both of them
<div n="lb"/>indulged in hot words against each other, Śarmiṣṭhā
<div n="lb"/>calling Śukrācārya a beggar living in her father's
<div n="lb"/>palace for his food. Not only that, she pushed Devayānī
<div n="lb"/>into a neglected well and went her way.
<div n="NI"/>At that time prince Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, was hunting
<div n="lb"/>in that forest. Feeling very thirsty he came to the well
<div n="lb"/>for a drink and therein saw Devayānī in tears. He
<div n="lb"/>brought her out from the well and leaving her there
<div n="lb"/>went on his way.
<div n="NI"/>Śukrācārya and his wife actually got anxious and upset
<div n="lb"/>that their daughter had not returned even after the
<div n="lb"/>lapse of so much time and deputed their servant
<div n="lb"/>Gurṇikā to seek for Devayānī. She found her out in
<div n="lb"/>the forest. But, Devayānī refused to return home as
<div n="lb"/>she did not want to continue as the daughter of one
<div n="lb"/>who lived on the charity of Śarmiṣṭhā and her father.
<div n="lb"/>Gurṇikā carried back this news to Śukrācārya, who then
<div n="lb"/>went himself to the forest and met his daughter. He
<div n="lb"/>felt deeply wounded to hear about the insults heaped
<div n="lb"/>on his daughter by Śarmiṣṭhā, and sent word to
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣaparvan that they were not returning to the palace.
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣaparvan realised that if Śukrācārya quarrelled
<div n="lb"/>with him the whole asura world also would become
<div n="lb"/>divided. He, therefore, tried his best to pacify the
<div n="lb"/>ācārya and his daughter. At last Devayānī agreed to re-
<div n="lb"/>turn to the palace in case Śarmiṣṭhā went to her with one
<div n="lb"/>thousand of her maids to serve as her (Devayānī's) maids.
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣaparvan acted accordingly and Devayānī was
<div n="lb"/>satisfied and returned to the palace with her father.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 78 onwards.)
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Wedding of Devayānī.%} Some time afterwards when
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī was sporting in the forest with Śarmiṣṭhā and
<div n="lb"/>others, King Yayāti happened to pass that way. They
<div n="lb"/>recognised each other and Devayānī requested Yayāti
<div n="lb"/>to marry her as she had mentally chosen him as her
<div n="lb"/>husband on the very same day on which he had saved
<div n="lb"/>her from the well.
<div n="NI"/>Yayāti realised only too well that it was really danger-
<div n="lb"/>ous to marry the daughter of Śukrācārya in the forest
<div n="lb"/>secretly and he, therefore, rejected Devayānī's request.
<div n="lb"/>But, she got down her father there and with his per-
<div n="lb"/>mission Yayāti married her. He also got much wealth
<div n="lb"/>by way of dowry. Śarmiṣṭhā and her maids accompanied
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī but Sukrācārya warned Yayāti that on no
<div n="lb"/>account should he touch Śarmiṣṭhā.
<div n="NI"/>With his wife and her attendants Yayāti returned to
<div n="lb"/>his palace; but he put Śarmiṣṭhā and her maids in
[Page216-a+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>a place newly built for the purpose. Devayānī delivered
<div n="lb"/>a child in due course and it was named Yadu. Śarmiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhā one day met Yayāti in the forest and requested
<div n="lb"/>for a child by him. Though at first he was reluctant to
<div n="lb"/>oblige remembering only too well the injunction of
<div n="lb"/>Śukrācārya, he at last succumbed to the eloquence of
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā. She got pregnant by him and the child
<div n="lb"/>she delivered was called Druhyu.
<div n="NI"/>Devayānī was alarmed at the birth of a child to
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭha, who was unmarried, and questioned her
<div n="lb"/>about it. Śarmiṣṭhā's answer that a brahmin stranger,
<div n="lb"/>who came that way was the father of her child satisfied
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī.
<div n="NI"/>Ere long another son, Turvasu, was born to Devayānī,
<div n="lb"/>and Śarmiṣṭhā too delivered two children called
<div n="lb"/>Anudruhyu and Pūru. Thus the mistress (Devayānī)
<div n="lb"/>had two sons and her servant, Śarmiṣṭhā three sons.
<div n="NI"/>While Yayāti and Devayānī were one day strolling in
<div n="lb"/>the garden the sons of Śarmiṣṭhā came there. She
<div n="lb"/>noticed the close resemblance of those boys to her
<div n="lb"/>husband (Yayāti) and it kindled her wrath. Though
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti did not, because of the presence of Devayānī,
<div n="lb"/>notice the children, when she asked them who their
<div n="lb"/>father was, they answered “Yayāti”, whereupon in
<div n="lb"/>great rage she ran up to her father. Yayāti too followed
<div n="lb"/>her. Devayānī told her father about the infidelity of
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti and he (Śukra) cursed that Yayāti be afflicted
<div n="lb"/>with old age. When Yayāti asked for redemption from
<div n="lb"/>the curse Śukrācārya told him that he could exchange
<div n="lb"/>his old age for the youth of somebody else.
<div n="NI"/>Yayāti then called together all his five sons and asked
<div n="lb"/>them whether anyone of them was prepared to exchange
<div n="lb"/>his (son's) youth for his (Yayāti's) old age for one
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. The three elder sons refused to agree
<div n="lb"/>to the proposal, but the fourth son Pūru gladly exchan-
<div n="lb"/>ged his youth with his father's old age. After spending
<div n="lb"/>his life in youthful enjoyment for one thousand
<div n="lb"/>years Yayāti returned his youth to Pūru, and Pūru
<div n="lb"/>assumed Kingship of the country. (Ādi Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>81-83).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Synonyms for Devayānī.%} Auśanasī, Śukratanayā and
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgavī.
