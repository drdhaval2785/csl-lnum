SĪTĀ¦. Wife of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Who is Sītā?%} Sītā is the incarnation of Mahālakṣmī.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī took the birth of a woman because of the curse
<div n="lb"/>of Sarasvatī. Vedavatī, Sītā, Pāñcālī, all these women
<div n="lb"/>of chastity were the incarnations of Lakṣmī The stories
<div n="lb"/>of Lakṣmī passing from birth to birth such as Vedavatī,
<div n="lb"/>Tulasī, Sītā, Pāñcālī and so on until at last she reached the
[Page720-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>world of Viṣṇu, occurring in various Purāṇas are
<div n="lb"/>collected and given here.
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā were the wives of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. One day Viṣṇu was sitting with his three wives
<div n="lb"/>and entertaining them with conversation when Devī
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā looked at Viṣṇu amorously. Instantly a quarrel
<div n="lb"/>arose among the three of them. When the row became
<div n="lb"/>uncontrollable, Sarasvatī cursed Lakṣmī to take birth
<div n="lb"/>in the earth as a plant. Gaṇgā cursed Sarasvatī and
<div n="lb"/>made her a river. Sarasvatī cursed Gaṅgā and made her
<div n="lb"/>a river. At the end of all these rows and curses Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>stood up and said to Lakṣmī. “Lakṣmī! you will take
<div n="lb"/>birth as the daughter of Dharmadhvaja on the earth
<div n="lb"/>with the name Tulasī. In order that the curse of Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>may come true, a plant called Tulasī (holy basil) will
<div n="lb"/>grow up on the earth from a portion of you. While
<div n="lb"/>you are living as the daughter of Dharmadhvaja, an
<div n="lb"/>asura named Śaṅkhacūḍa born from my portion will
<div n="lb"/>marry you.”
<div n="NI"/>The curse was realized. Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā became
<div n="lb"/>rivers. Lakṣmī was about to be born as the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Dharmadhvaja. Who was Dharmadhvaja? He was
<div n="lb"/>a man of righteous deeds and good qualities, born of
<div n="lb"/>the family of Dakṣasāvarṇi who was born from a portion
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu. Brahmasāvarṇī was born from Dakṣasā-
<div n="lb"/>varni. Dharmasāvarṇi begot Rudrasāvarṇi, Indrasā-
<div n="lb"/>varṇi begot Vṛṣadhvaja. Rathadhvaja was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Vṛṣadhvaja. Two sons named Dharmadhvaja and
<div n="lb"/>Kuśadhvaja were born to Rathadhvaja. Dharmadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>and Kuśadhvaja were performing penance before Devī
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī to regain the wealth and prosperity lost by the
<div n="lb"/>curse of the Sun.
<div n="NI"/>How did Dharmadhvaja and Kuśadhvaja lose their
<div n="lb"/>prosperity? Their grandfather Vṛṣadhvaja was a devotee
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva. He performed penance before Śiva for a long
<div n="lb"/>time. Śiva became pleased with Vṛṣadhvaja and lived
<div n="lb"/>in his hermitage for the period of three Devayugas. This
<div n="lb"/>king Vṛṣadhvaja made a proclamation that none other
<div n="lb"/>than Śiva should be worshipped. As all the other gods
<div n="lb"/>were despised, the Sun got angry and cursed Vṛṣadhvaja.
<div n="lb"/>“Let the prosperity of yours and your posterity be dest-
<div n="lb"/>royed.” Śiva did not like the action taken by the Sun
<div n="lb"/>against his favourite. Śiva took his trident and went
<div n="lb"/>against the Sun, who took refuge near his father Pra-
<div n="lb"/>jāpati Kaśyapa. Kaśyapa complained to Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā ran to Vaikuṇṭha. Śiva also came there with
<div n="lb"/>his trident. Viṣṇu looked at them and said “You
<div n="lb"/>gods, hear this. What is the need of all this hurry?
<div n="lb"/>Within the short time you have taken to run up to this
<div n="lb"/>place so many years have elapsed in the world. It is a
<div n="lb"/>long time since Vṛṣadhavaja died. His son Rathadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>also is dead. Rathadhvaja has two sons named Dhar-
<div n="lb"/>madhvaja and Kuśadhvaja. They both have become
<div n="lb"/>Kings. But because of the curse of the Sun, they are
<div n="lb"/>devoid of any radiance. They are now worshipping
<div n="lb"/>Mahālakṣmī for radiance.” Hearing this talk of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu all of them returned to their places.
<div n="NI"/>It has been mentioned that Dharmadhvaja and Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja had been engaged in penance before Mahālakṣmī.
<div n="lb"/>Devī Mahālakṣmī appeared before them and granted
<div n="lb"/>their wish. Devī promised them that she would take
<div n="lb"/>birth as the daughter of each of them, and she would
<div n="lb"/>recover for them all the wealth and prosperity they had
<div n="lb"/>lost. Accordingly Mahālakṣmī took birth by her portion
<div n="lb"/>as the daughter of Mādhavī, the wife of Dharmadhvaja
[Page721-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>under the name Tulasī. (For the rest of the story of
<div n="lb"/>Tulasī see under Tulasī, Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>Mālāvatī was the wife of Kuśadhvaja. As Lakṣmī had
<div n="lb"/>promised to take birth as their daughter, both of them
<div n="lb"/>waited for the birth of the child uttering the Vedas. At
<div n="lb"/>this time a child was born from the mouth of Kuśadh-
<div n="lb"/>vaja. This child was the incarnation of Lakṣmī. With
<div n="lb"/>the birth of the child Kuśadhvaja regained all the
<div n="lb"/>wealth and prosperity he had lost. The child was named
<div n="lb"/>Vedavatī (Devavatī). She grew up and became a young
<div n="lb"/>woman. Her desire was to get Mahāviṣṇu as her husband.
<div n="lb"/>Once an asura named Śambhu came to the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Kuśadhvaja. When he saw Vedavatī he fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with her. He asked Kuśadhvaja for the hand of his
<div n="lb"/>daughter, but Kuśadhvaja did not give his consent.
<div n="NI"/>Śambhu got angry. He came back in the night and kill-
<div n="lb"/>ed Kuśadhvaja with his sword. Hearing the sound Veda-
<div n="lb"/>vatī woke up and saw the dead body of her father lying
<div n="lb"/>in a pool of blood. She looked at Śambhu angrily. In
<div n="lb"/>that fiery look Śambhu was burnt to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>Vedavatī began to perform very severe penance to get
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu as her husband. It was at this time that Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>had begun his campaign of conquest. He defeated all
<div n="lb"/>kings and was proceeding victoriously through the
<div n="lb"/>vicinity of the Himālayas, when he saw the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>damsel Vedavatī sitting alone and performing penance.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing so beautiful a girl engaged in penance, he told
<div n="lb"/>her that he was the famous Rāvaṇa with ten heads and
<div n="lb"/>requested her to throw away the garment of bark of the
<div n="lb"/>tree and the matted hair and to accept him as her
<div n="lb"/>husband. She rejected his request. The angry Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of her hand. She resisted using her teeth and
<div n="lb"/>finger-nails. She cried out that she wanted no more to
<div n="lb"/>retain the body made impure by the touch of a wicked
<div n="lb"/>person. She made a fire and jumped into it. Thus in
<div n="lb"/>the sight of Rāvaṇa, she burnt herself to death. Before
<div n="lb"/>death she vowed that in the next birth Mahāviṣṇu would
<div n="lb"/>become her husband and would kill Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa who himself was burning in the fire of amour,
<div n="lb"/>was extremely sorry at the death of the beautiful girl.
<div n="lb"/>He took the ashes of hers to Laṅkā and put them in a
<div n="lb"/>golden box and kept the box in a solitary place. He used
<div n="lb"/>to visit the place daily. Since the arrival of the ashes,
<div n="lb"/>bad omens began to occur in Laṅkā. One day Nārada
<div n="lb"/>came to Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa asked Nārada for the reason of
<div n="lb"/>constant occurrences of bad omens in Laṅkā. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>replied that the cause of bad omens was the golden box
<div n="lb"/>he was keeping and that if it was kept in Laṅkā any
<div n="lb"/>longer, it would cause destruction and that if it was
<div n="lb"/>destroyed, great disaster would follow. Nārada advised
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa to remove the box without opening it to some-
<div n="lb"/>where else outside Laṅkā. Accordingly Rāvaṇa caused
<div n="lb"/>the golden box to be dropped in the sea. By and by it
<div n="lb"/>came with the waves to the shore of Bhārata (India).
<div n="lb"/>Robbers took it and went to the north and hid it in a
<div n="lb"/>forest. They were not able to take it away again. Thus
<div n="lb"/>the box came to be deposited on the basin of a river in
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā.
<div n="NI"/>It was this river-basin that King Janaka selected as
<div n="lb"/>the place for sacrifice. Being kept in this holy place,
<div n="lb"/>the ashes of the body of Devavatī in the box mingled
<div n="lb"/>with her spirit and was taking shape into a child. When
<div n="lb"/>the place was ploughed for preparing the spot of sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice, for Janaka, this golden box was discovered. The
<div n="lb"/>child which was inside the box, was taken home and
[Page721-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>brought up by the king who named her Sītā. It was
<div n="lb"/>the portion of this Sītā herself that took birth next as
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī. (Devī Bhāgavata, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa)
<div n="NI"/>{%Other versions.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) The King Padmākṣa performed penance before
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu with a view to get Mahālakṣmī as daughter.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu gave the King a great Phallus to realize
<div n="lb"/>his wish. From that a beautiful girl was born. The
<div n="lb"/>King named her Padmā. When she attained marriage-
<div n="lb"/>able age, the King made preparations for her Svayaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>vara (the bride herself choosing a husband). On the
<div n="lb"/>day fixed for the marriage Rākṣasas came and destroy-
<div n="lb"/>ed all the preparations and killed King Padmākṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Because of her sorrow at this disaster Padmā jumped
<div n="lb"/>into the fire. The giants searched for Padmā every
<div n="lb"/>where, but they could not find her. They returned in
<div n="lb"/>disappointment.
<div n="NI"/>One day, during this period, Rāvaṇa was travelling in
<div n="lb"/>his Aerial chariot. When he reached this place, he
<div n="lb"/>saw Padmā who had come out of the fire. Rāvaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>fascinated by the beauty of Padmā. So he turned
<div n="lb"/>towards her. Seeing this, Padmā again jumped into
<div n="lb"/>the pile of fire for safety. Without any delay Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>made a search in the pile of fire. At last he got the
<div n="lb"/>body of Padmā (Sītā) in the form of five jewels. The
<div n="lb"/>disappointed Rāvaṇa placed the five jewels in a
<div n="lb"/>box and took it to Laṅkā and gave it to his wife
<div n="lb"/>Mandodarī. One day Mandodarī opened that box
<div n="lb"/>and saw Padmā sitting in the form of a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>virgin. Thinking that it was not propitious to keep
<div n="lb"/>her who was the cause of destruction to Padmākṣa, his
<div n="lb"/>family and kingdom, Mandodarī exerted pressure on
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa to cast the box out of Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa with
<div n="lb"/>his men took the box from Laṅkā and buried it in
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā. Before the box was closed Padmā cursed
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. “I will come to Laṅkā again to kill you and
<div n="lb"/>your clan.”
<div n="NI"/>One day when a brahmin of Mithilā was ploughing
<div n="lb"/>his field he got this box. Thinking that it belonged to
<div n="lb"/>the King, the brahmin took the box to King Janaka.
<div n="lb"/>The King took the child in the box and brought it up.
<div n="lb"/>He named the child Sītā. (Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa, 7-6).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) In Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa we see another story which
<div n="lb"/>is somewhat different from that we see in Ānanda
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa. It is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa who had become the harasser of the entire
<div n="lb"/>world began to harass the hermits and sages also. He
<div n="lb"/>used to shoot arrows at the hermits who were sitting in
<div n="lb"/>meditation in the forests, and taking their blood in the
<div n="lb"/>arrow-head, he stored it in a big pot. In the same
<div n="lb"/>forest a hermit named Gṛtsamada was engaged in
<div n="lb"/>penance to get a daughter who would be equal to
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī in everyway. He took milk with the head of
<div n="lb"/>Darbha grass and stored it daily in a pot. One day
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa came to his hermitage and took the pot of
<div n="lb"/>milk stealthily. He poured the milk into the pot in
<div n="lb"/>which he had stored the blood and stirring it well gave
<div n="lb"/>it to his wife Mandodarī. Seeing the character of her
<div n="lb"/>husband becoming worse and worse every day, Mando-
<div n="lb"/>darī became miserable. One day she decided to
<div n="lb"/>commit suicide and drank the contents of the pot
<div n="lb"/>given by Rāvaṇa. The thing which was taken for
<div n="lb"/>suicide, made her pregnant. Mandodarī buried that
<div n="lb"/>foetus in Kurukṣetra. After a while a girl was born
[Page722-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>from it. That child was Sītā, the daughter of King
<div n="lb"/>Janaka.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) There is a story in Devī Bhāgavata stating how
<div n="lb"/>Sītā was born as the daughter of Rāvaṇa. It is as
<div n="lb"/>follows:
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa wished to marry Mandodarī, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Maya. Then Maya said to Rāvaṇa thus:—“Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the horoscope of Mandodarī, the first child born
<div n="lb"/>to her will be the destroyer of its clan. So it would be
<div n="lb"/>better to kill that child.” Not acting upon the advice
<div n="lb"/>of Maya, Rāvaṇa put the first child in a box and
<div n="lb"/>buried it in the city of King Janaka. This child was
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, the wife of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Sītā grew up in the palace of King
<div n="lb"/>Janaka. Kuśadhvaja the younger brother of Janaka
<div n="lb"/>had three daughters. They were named Māṇḍavī,
<div n="lb"/>Ūrmilā and Śrutakīrti. Sītā grew up along with these
<div n="lb"/>three sisters. The four of them grew up as sisters and
<div n="lb"/>friends. Sītā grew up to be a young woman. Several
<div n="lb"/>young men wished to marry her. Janaka refused
<div n="lb"/>everyone of them. One day the princesses were play-
<div n="lb"/>ing with their maids in the garden of the harem. Sītā
<div n="lb"/>sat on the dais in the centre of the garden to make a
<div n="lb"/>flower garland. All their attempts to gather the jasmine
<div n="lb"/>flowers from the twigs of a large mango tree in the
<div n="lb"/>garden ended in failure. Śītā instantly ran to the
<div n="lb"/>weapon house and taking a bow and arrow, shot down
<div n="lb"/>the flowers. The flowers fell down on the cloth placed
<div n="lb"/>on the ground without being damaged. Janaka saw the
<div n="lb"/>shooting of Sītā, from the palace. He was amazed at
<div n="lb"/>the expertness of Sītā. The bow which Sītā took was
<div n="lb"/>Śaivacāpa (the bow of Śiva). Śiva had used this bow,
<div n="lb"/>in days of old, to destroy the sacrifice of Dakṣa. Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>who was pacified by the destruction of the sacrifice of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa and the victory over his enemies, gave this bow
<div n="lb"/>to his devotee, the King of Videha. That King kept
<div n="lb"/>the bow in his weapon-house and used to worship it.
<div n="lb"/>Śītā had taken that bow and shot with it.
<div n="NI"/>The King who had been thinking about the marriage
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā thought that what he saw was a good omen. So
<div n="lb"/>the King made a proclamation that only he who could
<div n="lb"/>take the bow of Śiva, draw it, and shoot with it would
<div n="lb"/>become eligible to marry Sītā. Hearing this many
<div n="lb"/>adventurers came to the palace and tried to handle the
<div n="lb"/>Śaivacāpa and retreated admitting defeat. It was at
<div n="lb"/>this time that Viśvāmitra brought Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>about the Svayaṃvara of Sītā, Viśvāmitra took the
<div n="lb"/>princes to the palace of Janaka. The King was greatly
<div n="lb"/>pleased when he learned that the princes were the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Daśaratha, of the solar Dynasty. Next morning,
<div n="lb"/>at the instruction of his elders and priests and teachers,
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma stood on the dais in the middle of the hall,
<div n="lb"/>where the Śaivacāpa was placed, ready to handle it.
<div n="lb"/>He lifted up the bow with his left hand, drew it easily
<div n="lb"/>and fastened the string tightly and the bow was broken.
<div n="lb"/>When the Kings who were present, heard the roaring
<div n="lb"/>sound of the breaking of the bow, they shivered with
<div n="lb"/>fear as serpents at the sound of thunder. Sītā jumped
<div n="lb"/>with joy like a peacock. A letter was sent to Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>then and there. Friends and relatives arrived. Under
<div n="lb"/>the guidance of the presiding priest Śatānanda, the
<div n="lb"/>marriage ceremony was conducted. Rāma married
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, Bharata married Māṇḍavī, Lakṣmaṇa married
<div n="lb"/>Ūrmilā, and Śatrughna married Śrutakīrti. The brides
[Page722-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and bridegrooms went to Ayodhyā with their parents
<div n="lb"/>and relatives. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Anasūyā's gift of clothes and ornaments.%} Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>who had become old, wished to hand over the realm to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma. Since Kaikeyī stood as a hindrance, the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom fell into the hands of Bharata. Moreover
<div n="lb"/>Sītā had to live in the forest with Śrī Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa for fourteen years. In the early period of
<div n="lb"/>their forest-life they visited the hermitage of Atri.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the devotion of Sītā towards her husband,
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā the wife of hermit Atri, blessed her and
<div n="lb"/>gave her a fine garland, clothes and ornaments and
<div n="lb"/>cosmetics. Anasūyā blessed Sītā again and said that
<div n="lb"/>she would shine as Lakṣmī if she besmeared her body
<div n="lb"/>with the divine cosmetics. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Sargas 118-120).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Test by Pārvatī and Parameśvara.%} In the last year of
<div n="lb"/>forest-life Pārvatī and Parameśvara tested the firmness
<div n="lb"/>of the love of Sītā and Rāma. (See under Rāma, Para
<div n="lb"/>14).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Phantom Sītā.%} A few days before the abduction of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā by Rāvaṇa, Fire god took the guise of a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>and approached Śrī Rāma and said: “O, Śrī Rāma!
<div n="lb"/>The Devas have sent me to tell you certain things
<div n="lb"/>which will take place shortly. Your incarnation has
<div n="lb"/>the aim of killing Rāvaṇa. Sītā is meant to be a cause
<div n="lb"/>for the same. The death of Rāvaṇa is imminent. He
<div n="lb"/>will come and carry Sītā away. So entrust Sītā with
<div n="lb"/>me. I will keep her carefully. Make a phantom
<div n="lb"/>(Māyā) Sītā and keep her here, instead of the real
<div n="lb"/>Sītādevī. After the killing of Rāvaṇa, when Sītā enters
<div n="lb"/>fire as a proof of her purity, I will return Devī Sītā.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma agreed to it. Fire god by his power of contem-
<div n="lb"/>plation, created a phantom Sītā, exactly like the real
<div n="lb"/>Sītā in shape and figure and nature and placing her beside
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, he disappeared with the real Sītā. Even Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was not aware of this fact. The real Sītā Devī was under
<div n="lb"/>the care of Fire god till the moment of the test of chastity
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā by fire, after the killing of Rāvaṇa. During the
<div n="lb"/>time of entering the fire the illusory Sītā vanished in
<div n="lb"/>the fire and the real Sītā came out. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 9).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Sītā killed Sahasramukha.%} See under Sahasramukha
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Abandonment of Sītā.%} See under Rāma, Para 31.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Sītā in the hermitage of Vālmīki.%} Abandoned Sītā, who
<div n="lb"/>was pregnant, wandered about in the forest and at last
<div n="lb"/>reached the hermitage of Vālmīki, who gave her protect-
<div n="lb"/>ion and shelter. The story of an occurrence at this
<div n="lb"/>time is given in Kathāsaritsāgara, Alaṅkāravatīlambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 1.
<div n="NI"/>The other hermits did not like Vālmīki's action of giving
<div n="lb"/>shelter to Sītā. They said “Sītā is impure. Otherwise
<div n="lb"/>her husband would not have abandoned her. By her
<div n="lb"/>association we also would become sinners. As the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki is kind, he will not cast her away especially
<div n="lb"/>when she is pregnant. So the best thing for all of us, is
<div n="lb"/>to go to another hermitage.” This murmuring of the
<div n="lb"/>hermits reached the ears of Vālmīki. He said “She is
<div n="lb"/>pure and chaste. I know it with my inward eyes.” But
<div n="lb"/>they did not believe it. Then Sīta said “Lord! you can
<div n="lb"/>test my chastity in whatever way you like, and if I am
<div n="lb"/>found to be impure you may cut off my head.”
<div n="NI"/>The hermits tested Sītā in the Ṭiṭṭibhasaras (a
<div n="lb"/>divine lake near the hermitage of Vālmīki) and were
[Page723-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>convinced that she was chaste and pure. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Ṭiṭṭibhasaras to know the greatness of this divine lake).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Cursed Sītā.%} Sītā was spending miserable days in the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Vālmīki. Her matrimonial life was a hell.
<div n="lb"/>Is there any special reason for misery? Yes. It is the
<div n="lb"/>curse of a bird. Once Śeṣa told this story, of the cursing
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā by a bird, to the hermit Vātsyāyana. That story
<div n="lb"/>is given below:
<div n="NI"/>The event took place when Sītā was a young girl in the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Janaka. One day while Sītā was playing in
<div n="lb"/>the garden she saw two parrots, cock and hen, which
<div n="lb"/>talked well. The spouses were delightfully engaged in
<div n="lb"/>love-making. As soon as the couple saw Sītā they flew
<div n="lb"/>up to a tree and sang thus: “A handsome king will take
<div n="lb"/>birth on the earth. His name will be Śrī Rāma. His
<div n="lb"/>wife's name will be Sītā. Their wedded life will be
<div n="lb"/>happy.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the song, Sītā thought that they were some
<div n="lb"/>divine persons, and asked her maids to catch them and
<div n="lb"/>give them food. The maids caught the parrots and
<div n="lb"/>brought them before Sītā. She asked the birds.
<div n="lb"/>“Don't fear. Who are you? Where do you come from?
<div n="lb"/>Who is that Rāma? Who is Sītā? How did you come to
<div n="lb"/>know of them? Tell me all. I will not hurt you!
<div n="NI"/>The birds replied. “In the forest there is a hermit named
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki. We live in his beautiful hermitage. That
<div n="lb"/>hermit has composed the story Rāmāyaṇa, which is yet
<div n="lb"/>to happen, and has taught it to his disciples. We have
<div n="lb"/>heard those songs. Having heard them over and over
<div n="lb"/>we also have learned them by heart. We will tell you
<div n="lb"/>who Rāma is and who Jānakī is and what would happen
<div n="lb"/>to her who lives happily with him. Hear it! Saying
<div n="lb"/>thus the parrots passed on to the story of Rāma. Due to
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice of the hermit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, Mahāviṣṇu incar-
<div n="lb"/>nated as four persons, of whom Rāma the eldest, with his
<div n="lb"/>younger brother and Viśvāmitra, would come to
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā. He would draw the bow and marry Sītā...
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was extremely pleased with the sweet song of
<div n="lb"/>the birds and asked them so many questions repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>with curiosity. Seeing the excitement of the questioner
<div n="lb"/>the parrots understood that she was Sītā herself. They
<div n="lb"/>asked her. “Beautiful girl! who are you? Why are you
<div n="lb"/>so much interested in knowing about Rāma? What is
<div n="lb"/>your name?” Sītā disclosed everything about her to
<div n="lb"/>the birds, and said “I am the same Sītā, the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Janaka you have sung about. I will let you go only on
<div n="lb"/>the day when that handsome prince Rāma comes and
<div n="lb"/>marries me. Your conversation has made me so curious.
<div n="lb"/>You can live comfortably in my house, eating sweet-
<div n="lb"/>meats.” The birds were in great fear when they heard
<div n="lb"/>this. They looked at each other and replied to Sītā.
<div n="lb"/>“Good child! we birds fly about in the sky and perch on
<div n="lb"/>trees and bush. Houses are not comfortable to us. More-
<div n="lb"/>over I am pregnant. After my delivery in our own place
<div n="lb"/>I will come here. You need not have any doubt.” The
<div n="lb"/>female parrot said thus. But Sītā did not let them go.
<div n="lb"/>Then the male parrot prayed humbly with anxiety.
<div n="lb"/>“Sītā, allow her to go. Why do you detain my beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful wife? Allow us to have our own way in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>My wife is pregnant. After the confinement both of us
<div n="lb"/>will come back.” Sītā said “Let her live with me. You
<div n="lb"/>may go as you please.”
<div n="NI"/>The parrots were in great sorrow. If they had not made
<div n="lb"/>any noise on that tree this detention would not have
<div n="lb"/>occurred. These pitiable supplications had no effect on
[Page723-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Sītā. The male bird cried to Sītā to let him take his
<div n="lb"/>mate along with him, and beat his head on the ground.
<div n="lb"/>Sītā was adamant. The female bird, filled with misery
<div n="lb"/>and anger cursed Sītā thus. “You have separated me
<div n="lb"/>from my husband. I am pregnant. May you too be
<div n="lb"/>separated from your husband when you become preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant”. When she had finished saying, she fell on the
<div n="lb"/>ground and wriggled and died. An acrial chariot came
<div n="lb"/>down to the earth from heaven for the soul of that bird
<div n="lb"/>which had died exalting and glorifying Śrī Rāma. The
<div n="lb"/>soul of the bird got into the chariot and went up to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. The male bird, being unable to bear the death
<div n="lb"/>of his beloved wife, dipped himself in the Gaṅgā. Before
<div n="lb"/>his death he cried out in anger. “I must be born in the
<div n="lb"/>city of Rāma. By my words, this Sītā should be sepa-
<div n="lb"/>rated from her husband and fall into misery.” He died
<div n="lb"/>in the Ganges in Krodha (anger) and fear. So he took
<div n="lb"/>rebirth with the name Krodhana as a washerman by
<div n="lb"/>caste and profession. It was this washerman who spoke
<div n="lb"/>words of calumny about Sītā. Due to the calumny of
<div n="lb"/>this washerman, Śrī Rāma abandoned Sītā and she
<div n="lb"/>had to take shelter in the hermitage of Vālmīki.
