ĀNA II¦. (Elephant). Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa narrates the
<div n="lb"/>origin of elephants thus: “Kaśyapa was born to Marīci,
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā. Kaśyapa married the daughters, Aditi,
<div n="lb"/>Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu and
<div n="lb"/>Analā, of Dakṣaprajāpati. Of these Krodhavaśā gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to ten girls, Mṛgī, Mṛgamadā, Harī, Bhadramatā,
<div n="lb"/>Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetā, Surabhi, Surasā, and Kadrū.
<div n="lb"/>Elephants were born as the sons of Mātaṅgī. (Sarga 14,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in the Mahābhārata to explain why the
<div n="lb"/>tongue of the elephant is curved inside. “Bhṛgu Maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>cursed Agni and greatly dejected over this he dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared from public and hid somewhere. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>started searching for him and it was an elephant that
<div n="lb"/>showed the devas the hiding place of Agni. Agni then
<div n="lb"/>cursed the elephants and said that thereafter all the
<div n="lb"/>elephants would have their tongues curved inside. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>36, Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>The signs of good elephants and the treatment to be
<div n="lb"/>accorded to sick ones are detailed in Agni Purāṇa.
<div n="lb"/>“Elephants with long trunks and heavy breathing be-
<div n="lb"/>long to the top class and they will possess great endu-
<div n="lb"/>rance power. Those who have nails eighteen or twenty
<div n="lb"/>in number and who became turbulent during winter
<div n="lb"/>belong to a superior class. Those ones whose right
<div n="lb"/>tusks are a bit raised, whose cry is stentorian as that of
<div n="lb"/>thunder whose ears are very big and whose skins are
<div n="lb"/>spotted are the best of the species. Other varieties espe-
<div n="lb"/>cially the dwarfish type and she-elephants in the early
<div n="lb"/>stage of pregnancy are not good and not fit to be tamed.
<div n="lb"/>Elephants who have Varṇa, Sattva, Bala, Rūpa, Kānti,
<div n="lb"/>Śarīraguṇa and Vega will conquer enemies in a battle;
<div n="lb"/>there is no doubt about it. Elephants are an ornament
[Page088-a+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>for any battle-array. The victory earned by a King with
<div n="lb"/>his elephants is more respected.
<div n="NI"/>For all diseases of an elephant Anuvāsana or Sneha-
<div n="lb"/>vasti is recommended. A bath after anointing it with
<div n="lb"/>oil or ghee is good. For skin diseases the ghee may be
<div n="lb"/>combined with Mañjal (Turmeric), Maramañjal or
<div n="lb"/>gomūtra (cow urine). If it suffers from enlargement
<div n="lb"/>of the belly, giving it a bath with sesame oil is good.
<div n="lb"/>It can be given Pañcalavaṇas and Vāruṇīmadya to
<div n="lb"/>drink. If there is fainting it must be given rice mixed
<div n="lb"/>with Vlalari, Triphala, Cukku, Mulaku and Tippali
<div n="lb"/>and water mixed with honey to drink. If there is head-
<div n="lb"/>ache anointing the head with sesame oil and inhala-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the same is good.
<div n="NI"/>For diseases of the foot, treatment with Snehapuṭas is
<div n="lb"/>prescribed. To get motion of the bowels Kalkaṇṭa
<div n="lb"/>Kaṣāya (infusion of sugar candy) is good. To those who
<div n="lb"/>have shivers should be given the flesh of peacock,
<div n="lb"/>Tittiri bird and Lāva bird mixed with Tippali and pep-
<div n="lb"/>per. For dysentery the tender fruit of Kūvala, skin of
<div n="lb"/>Pāccotti, flower of Tātiri should be dried and powder-
<div n="lb"/>ed and be given mixed with sugar along with rice. For
<div n="lb"/>Karagraha (pain inside the trunk) Nasyam of ghee with
<div n="lb"/>Īntappū mixed in it should be done. It must be given
<div n="lb"/>“Muttaṅga Kañci with tippali, Cukku and Jīraka in
<div n="lb"/>it. For Utkarṇaka (pain in the ear) flesh of pigs should
<div n="lb"/>be given. For Galagraha (pain in the neck) a liniment
<div n="lb"/>made of Daśamūla, Mutirappuli and Kākkappancci in
<div n="lb"/>oil should be rubbed at the site of pain and the elephant
<div n="lb"/>kept under chains. If there is difficulty in passing urine
<div n="lb"/>light liquor containing powdered Aṣṭalavaṇas should
<div n="lb"/>be given. For all skin diseases use Vep oil as an oint-
<div n="lb"/>ment and give the infusion of Āṭaloṭaka to drink. For
<div n="lb"/>worms (inside the stomach) give cow's urine with pow-
<div n="lb"/>dered Vlālari in it. If the elephant is getting reduced
<div n="lb"/>and weak it should be given milk or meat soup with Cuk-
<div n="lb"/>ku, Tippali and grapes well mixed in it. If there is lack
<div n="lb"/>of appetite it is to be given Mulgaudana (rice boiled
[Page088-b+ 79]
<div n="lb"/>along with Cerupayar) to which is added Cukku, Mulaku
<div n="lb"/>and Tippali. If it is Gulma it should be given sesame
<div n="lb"/>oil boiled with the following: Trikotpakkonna, Cukku,
<div n="lb"/>Mulaku Tippali, Kotuvelikkilaṅgu, Nāgadantiveru,
<div n="lb"/>Erikkinveru, Nātkkotpakkonna, Milk and Attittippali.
<div n="lb"/>Navara rice with sort of cerupayar can also be given.
<div n="lb"/>For swellings on the face, a paste made of tender
<div n="lb"/>Kūvala fruits can be rubbed at the site of the swelling.
<div n="lb"/>For all sorts of pains in the stomach rice well mixed
<div n="lb"/>with the powder made by grinding together Vlālari,
<div n="lb"/>Kuṭakappālayari, Asafoetida, Carala, Mañjal, Mara-
<div n="lb"/>mañjal may be given.
<div n="NI"/>The best food for elephants is the rice of Navara, Vrīhi
<div n="lb"/>and cennellu. Yava and wheat are next to the above.
<div n="lb"/>Any other food is inferior to these. Yava and sugarcane
<div n="lb"/>will give strength to elephants. Dry yava rice is not
<div n="lb"/>good. Milk and meat cooked with carminative ingre-
<div n="lb"/>dients are good for elephants who have gone lean.
<div n="NI"/>If the elephants receive great injuries in a battle the
<div n="lb"/>meat of birds like crow, fowl, cuckoo and Hari mixed
<div n="lb"/>with honey is good. Fumigation by the burning of
<div n="lb"/>chilli, fish, Vlālari, caustic soda, Puttal, Pīram and
<div n="lb"/>maramañjal mixed together is effective. Dropping
<div n="lb"/>honey medicated with tippali tandula, sesame oil, and
<div n="lb"/>fruit honey in the eyes is not only good for the eyes but
<div n="lb"/>is also inducive of digestion. Make an ointment with
<div n="lb"/>the faces of the birds cātaka and Pārāvata mixed with
<div n="lb"/>the burnt skin of Nātpāmara dissolved in light spirit.
<div n="lb"/>If this ointment is applied, the elephant would defeat
<div n="lb"/>all enemies in a battle. Powder Nīlotpala, Muttaṅga
<div n="lb"/>and Takara and make an ointment using rice gruel.
<div n="lb"/>Applying this ointment in the eye is excellent.
<div n="NI"/>If the nails grow they should be cut at least once a
<div n="lb"/>month. Once in a month an oil bath is good for the
<div n="lb"/>elephants. Elephant sheds should be spread with cow-
<div n="lb"/>dung discs and dust. Doing Seka with ghee during
<div n="lb"/>autumn and summer is advisable. (Chapter 287, Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
