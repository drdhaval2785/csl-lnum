ŚŪRPĀRAKA¦. Another name for Kerala. In Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 99, we read that Paraśurāma threw a
<div n="lb"/>“Śūrpa” winnowing basket from Gokarṇa southwards
<div n="lb"/>and the ocean up to the spot where the Śūrpa fell, be-
<div n="lb"/>came dry land. Since the land was formed by throwing
<div n="lb"/>the Śūrpa, it came to be called “Śūrpāraka”. References
<div n="lb"/>to Śūrpāraka in the Mahābhārata, are given below:-
<div n="NI"/>(i) In the course of his triumph of the southern lands,
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva conquered “Śūrpāraka”. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 31, Verse 65).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) There is a sacred bath here, known as “Śūrpāraka
<div n="lb"/>tīrtha”. By bathing here, one would obtain golden
<div n="lb"/>rāśis. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 43).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In Śūrpāraka Kṣetra, there is a sacrificial platform
<div n="lb"/>originally used by Jamadagni. Close by, there are two
<div n="lb"/>holy places called “Pāṣāṇa tīrtha” and “Candra tīrtha”.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 88, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Yudhiṣṭhira once happened to visit this sacred
<div n="lb"/>place. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 118, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Śūrpāraka is the land formed by the withdrawal of
<div n="lb"/>the ocean. It is also called “Aparāntabhūmi”. (Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 49, Verse 66).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 25,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 50 states that by bathing in the water of Śūrpāraka
<div n="lb"/>Kṣetra and observing a fast for a fortnight, one would
<div n="lb"/>be born as a prince in the next birth.
