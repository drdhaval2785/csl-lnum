ŚAṄKUKARṆA I¦. A muni, who lived at the sacred
<div n="lb"/>Kapardīśvara tīrtha in Vārāṇasī. There lived a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>in the temple there performing tapas. One day a lean
<div n="lb"/>and bony ghost, hungry and panting came to the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin. To the brahmin's question the ghost replied
<div n="lb"/>thus; “In my previous life I was a rich brahmin. I
<div n="lb"/>looked after my family well, but did not worship
<div n="lb"/>Devas, guests or cows. Nor did I do any pious deed.
<div n="lb"/>But, one day I happened to worship Lord Viśvanātha
<div n="lb"/>and touch his idol. Within a short period after that I
<div n="lb"/>died. You will please tell me the means, if any, for me
<div n="lb"/>to attain heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>Śaṅkukarṇa answered the ghost as follows:—“There
<div n="lb"/>lives no man on earth, who is more fortunate than your
<div n="lb"/>good self, who could touch and prostrate before Lord
<div n="lb"/>Viśvanātha. That good fortune has led you to me. You
<div n="lb"/>bathe in this holy tīrtha and you will lose your ghost-
<div n="lb"/>hood. The ghost, accordingly dived in the water and
<div n="lb"/>immediately rose up to heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Chapter 34).
