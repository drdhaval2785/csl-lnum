KĀLIDĀSA¦. The greatest poet and dramatist in Sans-
<div n="lb"/>krit. Some scholars opine that Kālidāsa flourished in
<div n="lb"/>the 8th Century B.C. while others place his date upto
<div n="lb"/>the period 11th Century A.D. At any rate most of the
<div n="lb"/>scholars consider the period between 1st Century B.C.
<div n="lb"/>and 5th Century A.D. as the most probable date of
<div n="lb"/>the great poet. Some of the main theories in this regard
<div n="lb"/>are as follows;—
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Eighth century B.C.%} Towards the close of Raghu-
<div n="lb"/>vaṃśa Mahākāvya Kālidāsa has referred to the son of
<div n="lb"/>King Agnimitra. Therefore the poet must have lived in
<div n="lb"/>the 8th Century B.C. This is the view of the scholar
<div n="lb"/>Hippolyte Fanche.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Second Century B.C.%} According to Dr. Kuñjan
<div n="lb"/>Rājā Kālidāsa lived in the second Century B.C., the
<div n="lb"/>reasons for the belief being as follows. The poet was a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of King Agnimitra of the Suṅga dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>This Agnimitra is eulogised in Kālidāsa's Mālavikāgni-
<div n="lb"/>mitra. Agnimitra is referred to in the Bharatavākya
<div n="lb"/>(epilogue) of the drama also.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%First Century B.C.%} The traditional belief is that
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa was a member in the assembly of poets and
<div n="lb"/>scholars of the court of emperor Vikramāditya, who
<div n="lb"/>started the Vikrama era in B.C. 56.

<div n="lb"/>Khyato Varāhamihiro nṛpateḥ sabhāyāṃ
<div n="lb"/>Ratnāni vai vararucir nava vikramasya.</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Fifth Century A.D.%} According to Dr. Keith, Kāli-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa lived in the fifth Century A.D. One Candra-
[Page375-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>gupta II, who defeated the Śakas in 339 A.D. was
<div n="lb"/>King of Ujjain. He was known as Vikramāditya also.
<div n="lb"/>Dr.Keith thinks that the great poet might have been
<div n="lb"/>a member of this King's court. Perhaps Kālidāsa had
<div n="lb"/>remembered his royal patron Vikramāditya in his
<div n="lb"/>drama called Vikramorvaśīya. Dr. Keith is further of
<div n="lb"/>the view that Kālidāsa composed Kumārasambhava
<div n="lb"/>after attending the birth celebrations of Kumāragupta,
<div n="lb"/>son of King Vikramāditya.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Sixth Century A.D.%} Three scholars, Fergusson, Max
<div n="lb"/>Muller and Kern have opined that Kālidāsa lived in
<div n="lb"/>the sixth Century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>Whichever be the date of Kālidāsa it could be known
<div n="lb"/>from his works that he spent the major part of his life
<div n="lb"/>in Ujjain, and was inextricably indebted to the city in
<div n="lb"/>many ways. Raghuvaṃśa and Kumārasambhava are
<div n="lb"/>his two mahākāvyas. He had also written three dramas,
<div n="lb"/>Abhijñānaśākuntala, Vikramorvaśīya and Mālavikāgni-
<div n="lb"/>mitra and a lyric called Ṛtusaṃhāra. He wrote also a
<div n="lb"/>world-famous poem called Meghasandeśa.
