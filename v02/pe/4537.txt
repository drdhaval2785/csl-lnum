<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A celebrated country of ancient

<div n="NI"/>2) {%The-wealth of Mithilā.%} Mithilā was the capital of the

<div n="lb"/>Rājasa-rājalakṣmī (embodiment of royal prosperity)

<div n="lb"/>be smeared. In the middle of Tretāyuga Videha was
<div n="lb"/>ruled by a Janaka who brought fame and prosperity to
<div n="lb"/>the successive generations. A devotee of Śiva and of a
<div n="lb"/>sāttvic disposition he was a Nityabrahmacārī (observing
<div n="lb"/>celibacy throughout life) and his wife a disciple of
<div n="lb"/>Maitreyī and well-versed in Advaitavedānta was a
<div n="lb"/>Nit abrahmacāriṇī.
<div n="NI"/>Videha grew prosperous with agricultural wealth by
<div n="lb"/>hard work put up by the peasants and divine wealth
<div n="lb"/>by the virtuous deeds of the King and the people. Agri-

<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
