AGASTYA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā-Marīci-Kaśyapa-Sūrya-Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} A story occurs in Uttara-Rāma-Carita
<div n="lb"/>about the birth of Agastya. Nimi was the son of Ikṣ-
<div n="lb"/>vāku of the Sūrya dynasty. When he ascended the
<div n="lb"/>throne he decided to celebrate a sacrifice of long
<div n="lb"/>duration. He invited Vasiṣṭha to perform the sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>But Vasiṣṭha, who had to participate in the sacrifice
[Page005-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of Indra, could not accept the invitation and Nimi
<div n="lb"/>had to return disappointed. At this he got angry,
<div n="lb"/>sought the help of Śatānanda, the son of the great
<div n="lb"/>hermit Gautama and the sacrifice was begun. Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>did not like this. He cursed Nimi that life might be
<div n="lb"/>separated from his body. Nimi retorted with the same
<div n="lb"/>curse. Vasiṣṭha's spirit separated itself from his body
<div n="lb"/>and began to roam about in the sky. At last he re-
<div n="lb"/>quested Brahmā to provide him with a body. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>granted his wish and said that he would be born again
<div n="lb"/>from Mitra and Varuṇa.
<div n="NI"/>When the spirit of Vasiṣṭha returned to the earth it
<div n="lb"/>was Mitra and Varuṇa moving about, having only one
<div n="lb"/>body for both. Vasiṣṭha's spirit entered into that body.
<div n="lb"/>One day Mitra-Varuṇa happened to see the celestial
<div n="lb"/>beauty, Urvaśī on the seashore. They embraced Urvaśī
<div n="lb"/>and immediately the spirit of Vasiṣṭha entered the
<div n="lb"/>body of Urvaśī.
<div n="NI"/>After this Mitra and Varuṇa separated themselves
<div n="lb"/>from one another and assumed two different bodies.
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa approached Urvaśī with lustful desire, but
<div n="lb"/>rejecting him Urvaśī accepted Mitra. Varuṇa had
<div n="lb"/>seminal flow and this semen was taken and kept in a
<div n="lb"/>pot. At the sight of this, remorse and passion arose
<div n="lb"/>in Urvaśī and the semen of Mitra already received
<div n="lb"/>in her womb oozed out and fell on the ground. This
<div n="lb"/>also was. collected and kept in the same pot along with
<div n="lb"/>that of Varuṇa. After a few days the pot broke open
<div n="lb"/>by itself and two babies came out. One was Agastya
<div n="lb"/>and the other Vasiṣṭha. As these two were born of the
<div n="lb"/>semen of Mitra and Varuṇa, they came to be known
<div n="lb"/>as Maitrāvaruṇis later. This story partly occurs in Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva of Mahābhārata, Verse 343 of Chapter 88.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Education.%} Very little is mentioned in the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>about the education of Agastya. Still there are am-
<div n="lb"/>ple proofs that he was well-versed in the Vedas and
<div n="lb"/>sciences and well skilled in the uses of diverse weapons.
<div n="lb"/>In Verse 9, Chapter 139 of Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa says to Arjuna as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“Agniveśa, my teacher was the disciple of Agastya, in the
<div n="lb"/>art of using bows and arrows and I am his disciple”.
<div n="NI"/>When it is said that even Agniveśa the teacher of
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa was a disciple of Agastya, his proficiency in the
<div n="lb"/>art of using weapons could easily be discerned.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage.%} There is an interesting story behind the
<div n="lb"/>marriage of such an austere man as Agastya, who had
<div n="lb"/>brought all the passions under control. As the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Agastya was walking along the forest, he saw his
<div n="lb"/>ancestors (Pitṛs) hanging head downwards in a canyon.
<div n="lb"/>He wanted to know the reason and they replied:
<div n="lb"/>“Child; we would be allowed to enter heaven only
<div n="lb"/>if sons are born to you. So get married as soon as
<div n="lb"/>possible”. The necessity of marriage occurred to him
<div n="lb"/>only then. But will there be any woman who could be
<div n="lb"/>patient enough to become the wife of this bearded
<div n="lb"/>dwarfish hermit? Agastya did not lose heart. At that
<div n="lb"/>time the King of Vidarbha was doing penance to
<div n="lb"/>obtain a son. Agastya collected the quintessence of
<div n="lb"/>all living beings, with which he created an extre-
<div n="lb"/>mely beautiful lady and named her Lopāmudrā.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya gave Lopāmudrā as daughter to the King of
<div n="lb"/>Vidarbha. The King who was delighted at getting
<div n="lb"/>such a daughter, employed hundreds of maids to look
<div n="lb"/>after the child, who soon grew up to be a young lady.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya once approached the King of Vidarbha
[Page005-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and expressed his wish to have Lopāmudrā as his
<div n="lb"/>wife. The King was in a dilemma. On the one hand
<div n="lb"/>he did not like his beautiful daughter having the
<div n="lb"/>brightness of fire, to be given as wife to the hermit,
<div n="lb"/>clad in the bark of trees and wearing tufts of matted
<div n="lb"/>hair. On the other hand he was afraid of the curse
<div n="lb"/>of the hermit Agastya. As the King was trying hard
<div n="lb"/>to find a solution, Lopāmudrā herself came to the
<div n="lb"/>King and said “Father, I am happy to say that I shall
<div n="lb"/>willingly become the wife of the hermit Agastya.” At
<div n="lb"/>last her father consented and discarding royal garments
<div n="lb"/>and ornaments, Lopāmudrā accompanied Agastya.
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in Vana Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 5,
<div n="lb"/>that they were married at Mahāsindhutīrtha. After
<div n="lb"/>their marriage they went to Gaṅgādvāra. (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 96).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The story of how Agastya ate Vātāpi.%} While Agastya
<div n="lb"/>was doing severe penance, Lopāmudrā attained
<div n="lb"/>puberty and had menstruation. Longing for a child,
<div n="lb"/>she went and stood beside Agastya. She expressed
<div n="lb"/>her wish to lead a family life. Her demands did
<div n="lb"/>not stop there. During conjugation, Agastya should
<div n="lb"/>wear flower garlands and ornaments, and she must
<div n="lb"/>be provided with divine ornaments. Agastya was
<div n="lb"/>surprised at the enormity of her demands. Poor, penni-
<div n="lb"/>less Agastya! Leaving Lopāmudrā in the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>he went in search of money. He at first approached
<div n="lb"/>King Śrutarvā, who produced accounts of his in-
<div n="lb"/>come and expenditure and convinced Agastya that
<div n="lb"/>he was having no balance at all. Agastya, accompa-
<div n="lb"/>nied by Śrutarvā, then proceeded to King Bradh-
<div n="lb"/>nāśva. He also produced accounts and refused to help
<div n="lb"/>Agastya, who then followed by Śrutarvā and Bradh-
<div n="lb"/>nāśva went on to the wealthy King Trasadasyu,
<div n="lb"/>who also producing his accounts refused to render
<div n="lb"/>any help to Agastya. Finally Agastya accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by the three Kings, went to the house of Ilvala, a
<div n="lb"/>noble asura of immense wealth.
<div n="NI"/>This asura Ilvala lived in Manimatpattana with his
<div n="lb"/>younger brother Vātāpi. Once Ilvala approached
<div n="lb"/>a hermit Brahmin and requested that his wish for
<div n="lb"/>a son, having the power and status of Indra, be grant-
<div n="lb"/>ed. The Brahmin refused to grant such a boon.
<div n="lb"/>Since then Ilvala and Vātāpi considered Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>as their enemies. The elder brother converted the
<div n="lb"/>younger one (Vātāpi) into a goat and whenever a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin visited his house, he would kill the goat,
<div n="lb"/>prepare mutton dishes and set them before his
<div n="lb"/>guest. When he had finished eating, Ilvala would call
<div n="lb"/>aloud. “Vātāpi, come out”. Breaking the stomach
<div n="lb"/>of the guest open, Vātāpi would come out. In this way
<div n="lb"/>Ilvala had killed a good number of Brāhmins. It was
<div n="lb"/>at this juncture that Agastya and the Kings came to
<div n="lb"/>beg money of him.
<div n="NI"/>Ilvala welcomed the guests with hospitality and as
<div n="lb"/>usual killed the goat, prepared food with it and served
<div n="lb"/>the food before Agastya. When Agastya had finished
<div n="lb"/>eating, Ilvala called Vātāpi loudly. But Agastya slowly
<div n="lb"/>said, “Vātāpi, jīrṇo bhava” (Let Vātāpi be digested)
<div n="lb"/>and immediately Vātāpi was digested in the stomach
<div n="lb"/>of Agastya. The awe-stricken asura Ilvala gave each
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin ten thousand cows and as much gold and
<div n="lb"/>to Agastya he doubled the quantity of alms. Over
<div n="lb"/>and above this, he presented Agastya with a chariot
<div n="lb"/>hitched with two fine horses called Virāvān and
[Page006-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Surāvān. Agastya returned to his hermitage and
<div n="lb"/>adorned himself as Lopāmudrā had demanded. (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 99).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Birth of a son.%} Lopāmudrā became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya told her, “A thousand ordinary sons, or
<div n="lb"/>hundred sons, each having the strength of ten ordinary
<div n="lb"/>sons, or ten sons, each having the strength of hundred
<div n="lb"/>ordinary sons, or a son, greater and nobler than one
<div n="lb"/>thousand sons—which of these do you prefer?”
<div n="lb"/>Lopāmudrā preferred one son. When she was with
<div n="lb"/>child Agastya again went to the forest to do penance.
<div n="lb"/>After seven years of pregnancy Lopāmudrā gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a lustrous son. The hermit Dṛḍhasyu, who is
<div n="lb"/>also called Idhmavāha, is this son. This child is said
<div n="lb"/>to have chanted the Vedas (Holy Scriptures) im-
<div n="lb"/>mediately on his birth. He used to gather twigs for
<div n="lb"/>kindling the sacrificial fire of his father, and hence he
<div n="lb"/>got the name Idhmavāha.
<F>*) Idhma—twigs of firewood. (Idhma=twigs of firewood) (vāha=carrier).</F>
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How he stamped the Vindhya mountain down.%} Once the
<div n="lb"/>talebearer Nārada happened to come to the Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>Mountain, who gladly welcomed Nārada, gave him a
<div n="lb"/>seat, showed hospitality and asked for news. Nārada said
<div n="lb"/>“May you be blessed. Just now I am coming from the
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru. Indra, Agni (fire) and other gods live
<div n="lb"/>there. Kailāsa, Niṣadha, Nīla, Gandhamādana etc. are
<div n="lb"/>mountains far nobler than this Meru. But they are
<div n="lb"/>not so haughty as him. That the Sun and the Moon
<div n="lb"/>and such others revolve round him, is the reason for his
<div n="lb"/>arrogance”. On hearing these tales, Vindhya thought
<div n="lb"/>that Meru should be taught a lesson. Once Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>made his peaks grow higher and higher till they touched
<div n="lb"/>the sky. The Sun, the Moon and others found it very
<div n="lb"/>difficult to pass over the high peaks in their usual jour-
<div n="lb"/>neys to the West, and so they had to roam about in
<div n="lb"/>the sky. When the journeys of the Sun and the Moon
<div n="lb"/>were hindered, everything in the world fell into chaos.
<div n="lb"/>The gods came to Vindhya in groups and tried to
<div n="lb"/>pacify him. But their attempts were futile. So they
<div n="lb"/>approached Agastya and made their petition to him.
<div n="lb"/>He agreed to pacify Vindhya somehow or other. Agas-
<div n="lb"/>tya and his wife came to Vindhya from Kāśinagara.
<div n="lb"/>When Vindhya saw Agastya he began to shiver with
<div n="lb"/>fear. Contracting all his high peaks, he bowed before
<div n="lb"/>Agastya, who said to Vindhya thus “Vindhya, I am
<div n="lb"/>going to South Bhārata. Let your heads be low till I
<div n="lb"/>come back”. Vindhya agreed. Agastya passed on to
<div n="lb"/>the South and built a hermitage in the Malayācala and
<div n="lb"/>lived there. Since then Agastya had never gone to
<div n="lb"/>the North and Vindhya had never risen up. As he had
<div n="lb"/>made the mountain (Aga) bow its head he got the
<div n="lb"/>name Agastya. (Tenth Skandha of Devībhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Nahuṣa transformed to a huge serpent by Agastya.%}
<div n="lb"/>Devendra killed Vṛttrāsura, an enemy of the gods.
<div n="lb"/>As Devendra had resorted to treachery for killing the
<div n="lb"/>enemy (see the word Vṛttrāsura) he incurred the sin
<div n="lb"/>of ‘Brahmahatyā’. Once Indra went to the Mānasasaras,
<div n="lb"/>without the knowledge of anybody and hid himself in
<div n="lb"/>the petal of a lotus flower. The gods and especially
<div n="lb"/>Śacīdevī were much alarmed at the disappearance of
<div n="lb"/>Devendra. Heaven was without a King. Bad omens
<div n="lb"/>began to appear. Indra, who had hidden in the lotus
<div n="lb"/>stalk in the shape of a water-snake, was not at all visible
[Page006-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>as the petals had closed over him. It was at this critical
<div n="lb"/>moment that King Nahuṣa had completed hundred
<div n="lb"/>horse-sacrifices and became eligible for the throne of
<div n="lb"/>Devendra. At a great gathering of the Gods Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>was elected as Devendra. Though Nahuṣa got all the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maids at his disposal in the Nandanodyāna
<div n="lb"/>(Nandana Garden) his passion for women was not
<div n="lb"/>satiated. So he began to have an eye on Indrāṇī. She
<div n="lb"/>was in sorrow and misery at the disappearance of her
<div n="lb"/>husband Indra, and did not at all look with favour on
<div n="lb"/>this new move on the part of the new Indra. She sought
<div n="lb"/>the help of Bṛhaspati, who agreed to protect her
<div n="lb"/>from Nahuṣa. The newly-elected Indra could not tole-
<div n="lb"/>rate this disloyalty on the part of Indrāṇī. He became
<div n="lb"/>furious and threatened Bṛhaspati with death, if Indrāṇī
<div n="lb"/>was not sent to him forthwith. All hermits gathered
<div n="lb"/>round Nahuṣa and tried with their advice to dissuade
<div n="lb"/>him from this attempt, but he would not be dissuaded.
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa belittled Bṛhaspati and all the hermits and was
<div n="lb"/>rude to them. Finally the hermits, being afraid of
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa, went to Bṛhaspati to persuade him to send
<div n="lb"/>Indrāṇī to Nahuṣa. Bṛhaspati suggested to Indrāṇī a
<div n="lb"/>way of safety. Accordingly she came to Nahuṣa and said
<div n="lb"/>to him “Lord, to become your wife, is a matter of great
<div n="lb"/>pleasure to me. But before that I must make sure if
<div n="lb"/>my husband is living anywhere. So allow me to make a
<div n="lb"/>search”. Nahuṣa agreed to this and by the blessings
<div n="lb"/>of Devī, Indrāṇī found out her husband. But Indra
<div n="lb"/>would not return to the court, with Indrāṇī, who
<div n="lb"/>then complained about Nahuṣa's outrageous behaviour.
<div n="lb"/>Indra advised her a new way to protect herself from
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa's onslaught.
<div n="NI"/>Indrāṇī returned to Nahuṣa and told him “Lord, wo-
<div n="lb"/>men generally love pomp and glory. I have a mania
<div n="lb"/>for vehicles. You should make a palanquin. Let the
<div n="lb"/>palanquin bearers be hermits. You must come to my
<div n="lb"/>house in that palanquin with hermits as your palanquin
<div n="lb"/>bearers and then I will accept you as my husband.”
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa agreed. He employed Agastya and such other
<div n="lb"/>hermits to bear his palanquin. He got into his palan-
<div n="lb"/>quin and started for Indrāṇī's house. His desire to
<div n="lb"/>reach Indrāṇī was such that he thought the hermits to
<div n="lb"/>be very slow. To make them quick enough he ordered
<div n="lb"/>“Sarpa, Sarpa” (walk quick, walk quick). The hermits
<div n="lb"/>began to run. Still Nahuṣa was not satisfied. He kicked
<div n="lb"/>at the heads of the hermits and whipped the dwarfish
<div n="lb"/>Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>Agastya got angry and cursed Nahuṣa thus: “Since
<div n="lb"/>you have whipped me saying ‘Sarpa Sarpa’, may you
<div n="lb"/>be transformed into a mahāsarpa (huge serpent) and
<div n="lb"/>fall into the great forest.”
<F>**) It is mentioned in the Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 100, that the person who cursed Nahuṣa and turned him
<div n="lb"/>into a huge serpent, was the hermit Bhṛgu, who had been hiding in the hair of Agastya.</F>
<div n="NI"/>The horror-stricken Nahuṣa pleased Agastya by praise.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya said that Nahuṣa would be freed from the
<div n="lb"/>curse and attain heaven when he happened to meet
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra. Nahuṣa instantly changed into a
<div n="lb"/>serpent of immense size and slided into a great forest
<div n="lb"/>in the Himālayās. (Devībhāgavata, 8th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>During their sojourn in the forest, the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>visited many holy places and reached the Yāmuna
<div n="lb"/>mountain in the Himālayās. When Bhīma was passing
<div n="lb"/>by the mouth of a cave he was attacked by a huge
<div n="lb"/>serpent. In spite of his immense strength Bhīma could
[Page007-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>not extricate himself from the hold of the snake, who
<div n="lb"/>eventually informed Bhīma of its previous history.
<div n="lb"/>When Bhīma understood that the serpent was none
<div n="lb"/>other than Nahuṣa, a King of the Sūrya dynasty
<div n="lb"/>(Solar), he felt sorry for him. Dharmaputra, who
<div n="lb"/>came there in search of Bhīma, talked with Nahuṣa,
<div n="lb"/>who immediately regained his original form and
<div n="lb"/>went to heaven. (Mahābhārata, Chapter 17 of
<div n="lb"/>Udyoga Parva; Chapter 179 of Vana Parva; Chapter
<div n="lb"/>342 of Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%How Agastya drank up the ocean.%} Indra ruthlessly
<div n="lb"/>killed Vṛttrāsura, who had been harassing the Gods,
<div n="lb"/>with the help of the Kālakeyas. The frightened Kāla-
<div n="lb"/>keyas got into the ocean and hid themselves at the
<div n="lb"/>bottom. From that hideout they decided to destroy
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds. At night they came out on the
<div n="lb"/>earth and ate a good deal of Brahmins, and caused
<div n="lb"/>much damage to the hermitages of Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana. All the Brahmins on the earth were terribly
<div n="lb"/>afraid of the Kālakeyas. The gods went to Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and prayed for protection. Viṣṇu informed them that
<div n="lb"/>the Kālakeyas could not be caught unless the ocean
<div n="lb"/>was dried up, and this task could be performed only
<div n="lb"/>by Agastya. So the Gods approached Agastya and told
<div n="lb"/>him what Viṣṇu had informed them. With pleasure
<div n="lb"/>Agastya accepted the job. Accompanied by the Gods
<div n="lb"/>and hermits he neared the swaying and surging ocean.
<div n="lb"/>While all were watching unwinkingly Agastya brought
<div n="lb"/>the great ocean into his palm and drank it up very
<div n="lb"/>easily and subsequently the Kālakeyas were killed.
<div n="lb"/>Now the Gods again approached Viṣṇu and made
<div n="lb"/>representation about the loss of the ocean. Viṣṇu told
<div n="lb"/>them that by the penance of Bhagīratha the divine
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā would fall into the earth and then the ocean
<div n="lb"/>will be filled. In this way the earth regained its lost
<div n="lb"/>ocean. (Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapters 101 to
<div n="lb"/>105).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Agastya cursing Kubera and his companion.%} In the
<div n="lb"/>course of their sojourn in forest, the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>visited several holy places and reached the proximity
<div n="lb"/>of the Himālayas. Leaving his brothers behind,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna went up the Mahāmeru to worship Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Years passed by. At last his brothers also started
<div n="lb"/>for the Mahāmeru in search of Arjuna and with
<div n="lb"/>the help of the hermits Vṛṣaparvā and Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, they
<div n="lb"/>reached Kuberapurī (the capital of Kubera). There
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma destroyed the army of Kubera and killed
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimān, his friend and favourite. Dharmaputra,
<div n="lb"/>repenting of his younger brother's iniquity bowed
<div n="lb"/>before Kubera and asked him with politeness, why the
<div n="lb"/>power of Gods gave way to the power of man. Kubera
<div n="lb"/>replied that it was due to the curse of Agastya and
<div n="lb"/>began to depict the event thus: Once my friend
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimān and myself were going, in a chariot, to be
<div n="lb"/>present at the singing and chanting just begun at
<div n="lb"/>Kuśavatī. At that time Agastya was standing in his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage on the bank of Kālindī, performing Sun
<div n="lb"/>worship. When Maṇimān saw this from the sky, he
<div n="lb"/>spat on the head of Agastya, who instantly getting wild
<div n="lb"/>cursed me. “Lo, Kubera, your friend Maṇimān
<div n="lb"/>spat on my head in your sight. So this Maṇimān and
<div n="lb"/>your army will meet with death at a man's hand.
<div n="lb"/>When they die you should not feel sorry for them. If
<div n="lb"/>it becomes possible for you to meet the man who
<div n="lb"/>killed Maṇimān you will be liberated from the curse.”
[Page007-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>It is this curse that brought about the death of
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimān and the army. When Kubera saw Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>face to face his curse was revoked. (Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 160).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Agastya cursing Mārīca and Tāḍakā.%} The boys
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went to the forest with Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra for protecting sacrifice. When they entered the
<div n="lb"/>Tāḍakā forest Viśvāmitra told them the story of
<div n="lb"/>Tāḍakā thus:—
<div n="NI"/>Tāḍakā is the daughter of Suketu, a semi god of the
<div n="lb"/>tribe Yakṣa. Being childless for a long time Suketu was
<div n="lb"/>miserable and began to do penance before Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>who blessed him and granted his wish and a daughter
<div n="lb"/>was born to him. This daughter was named Tāḍakā.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā blessed her, giving her the strength of one
<div n="lb"/>thousand elephants. Tāḍakā grew up and became a
<div n="lb"/>young woman. Suketu gave her in marriage to Sunda,
<div n="lb"/>son of Iharjha. Tāḍakā gave birth to a son called
<div n="lb"/>Mārīca. When Sunda was killed, Tāḍakā got wild
<div n="lb"/>and ran into the hermitage of Agastya causing much
<div n="lb"/>havoc there. At this Agastya got angry and cursed
<div n="lb"/>her to become a Rākṣasī (giantess) and instantly
<div n="lb"/>the bodies of Tāḍakā and Mārīca were deformed.
<div n="lb"/>Tāḍakā could not control her anger and she demo-
<div n="lb"/>lished the hermitage of Agastya. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%The story of the theft of lotus.%} Once Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and other hermits went on a pilgrimage,
<div n="lb"/>with Indra as their leader. On the way they
<div n="lb"/>reached Brahmasaras, in the holy place of Kauṣikī.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya had grown some lotus flowers there. The
<div n="lb"/>pilgrims plucked stealthily all the lotus flowers nur-
<div n="lb"/>tured by Agastya and ate them. The furious Agastya
<div n="lb"/>got into the midst of the hermits in search of the
<div n="lb"/>culprit. None admitted the theft. Finally he caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of Indra, as the thief. Indra said “O, Lord,
<div n="lb"/>had it not been for my eagerness to hear discourses
<div n="lb"/>on duty from your face, I would not have stolen
<div n="lb"/>your lotus flowers.” Saying thus Indra returned the
<div n="lb"/>lotus flowers. Agastya was pleased and let Indra
<div n="lb"/>and the hermits depart in peace. (Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 94).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%How Agastya burned the Asuras (demons).%} (This
<div n="lb"/>story occurs in the Mahābhārata as, having been told
<div n="lb"/>by the God Vāyu to Bhīṣma as a discourse on the
<div n="lb"/>greatness of Agastya, and Bhīṣma reiterating it to
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>Once the Gods had to accept defeat at the hands of
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras (Demons) and they approached Agastya
<div n="lb"/>and said thus: Oh, hermit, since we have been defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the Asuras, our prosperity is at an end. There
<div n="lb"/>is none to help us but you.” Hearing this Agastya
<div n="lb"/>became angry and began to burn the Asuras to death,
<div n="lb"/>by the merits of his penance. Many of them fell down
<div n="lb"/>on the earth and some fell into Pātāla (the nether world).
<div n="lb"/>The asuras who thus fell were not killed by Agas-
<div n="lb"/>tya. Thus the menace of the Asuras in heaven was
<div n="lb"/>warded off, and the Gods lived in peace and prosperity.
<div n="lb"/>(Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 155, Verses
<div n="lb"/>1 to 13).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Indra's conflict with Agastya.%} Once Agastya com-
<div n="lb"/>menced a sacrifice of twelve years' duration. Many
<div n="lb"/>hermits participated in this sacrifice. No sooner had
<div n="lb"/>the hermit begun the sacrifice, than Indra, (the God of
<div n="lb"/>Thunder and Rain) stopped rain in the world. Crops
[Page008-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>could not be raised. But Agastya provided everybody
<div n="lb"/>who took part in the sacrifice, with sumptuous meals.
<div n="lb"/>The hermits wondered how Agastya could do this. Some
<div n="lb"/>of the hermits feared that the sacrifice would have to be
<div n="lb"/>stopped before the stipulated time, if the drought con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued. Agastya told them not to fear, and that if
<div n="lb"/>Indra refused to send rain, he himself would become
<div n="lb"/>Indra and protect the subjects. Indra was horrified,
<div n="lb"/>when he heard this and he began to send rain regu-
<div n="lb"/>larly. (Mahābhārata, Āśvamedhika Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>92).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Story of Gajendramokṣa (The redemption of an elephant).%}
<div n="lb"/>In the Bhārata a story occurs, as to how Agastya
<div n="lb"/>cursed King Indradyumna, and turned him to an ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant. While Indradyumna, the King of Pāṇḍya was
<div n="lb"/>absorbed in deep meditation on Viṣṇu, Agastya reach-
<div n="lb"/>ed the palace. Being immersed in meditation the King
<div n="lb"/>failed to notice the arrival of the great hermit, who
<div n="lb"/>getting angry with the King, cursed him to become an
<div n="lb"/>elephant, for one thousand years. Instantly the King
<div n="lb"/>was deformed into a big tusker and quitting the palace
<div n="lb"/>it went to a big forest and lived there happily with the
<div n="lb"/>she-elephants there. At that time a hermit named De-
<div n="lb"/>vala was doing penance in that forest. One day Hūhu,
<div n="lb"/>a gandharva (a class of semi-gods) enjoying the com-
<div n="lb"/>pany of some celestial maids came to the place where
<div n="lb"/>Devala had put up his hermitage. The hermit saw
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva and the maids playing and bathing in
<div n="lb"/>the pond in front of his hermitage in complete nudity.
<div n="lb"/>Getting angry Devala cursed Hūhu and he was de-
<div n="lb"/>formed into a crocodile. This pond which was in the
<div n="lb"/>Trikūṭa Mountain was thus under the suzerainty of
<div n="lb"/>the crocodile. The tusker (Indradyumna) entered the
<div n="lb"/>pond to drink water. The crocodile caught hold of the
<div n="lb"/>leg of the elephant. Each tried to pull the other with
<div n="lb"/>equal force. This fight is said to have lasted for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. When both were tired, godly feelings
<div n="lb"/>began to dawn in their minds. Then, riding on an
<div n="lb"/>eagle Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them, cut them
<div n="lb"/>asunder with his Cakrāyudha (the wheel-weapon)
<div n="lb"/>and both were given deliverance. (Bhāgavata, 8th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Agastya teaching Śrī Rāma the Āditya-hṛdaya Mantra%}
<div n="lb"/>{%(A hymn in praise of the Sun).%} When Śrī Rāma was
<div n="lb"/>fighting with Rāvaṇa in Laṅkā, dejection befell him,
<div n="lb"/>his heart being weighed down with faintness, for a
<div n="lb"/>little while. Rāvaṇa made the best use of this oppor-
<div n="lb"/>tunity and began to advance. The gods had gathered
<div n="lb"/>in the sky above to witness the fight. Agastya, at that
<div n="lb"/>particular moment, taught Śrī Rāma the Āditya-hṛdaya
<div n="lb"/>Mantra, a hymn in praise of the Sun-god and when
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma chanted that mantra, he resumed fight with
<div n="lb"/>Vigour and Rāvaṇa was defeated and slain. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 107).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%How the slant of the earth was rectified by seating%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Agastya.%} The matrimonial ceremony of Śrī Parameś-
<div n="lb"/>vara and Pārvatī was held in the Himālayas. On
<div n="lb"/>that auspicious occasion all the living beings of the
<div n="lb"/>world were present, and as a result the Himālayan
<div n="lb"/>region sank down and the earth slanted to that side.
<div n="lb"/>To keep the equilibrium of the earth, Śiva sent
<div n="lb"/>Agastya to the south. Accordingly Agastya reached
<div n="lb"/>Kuttālam, where there was a temple dedicated to
<div n="lb"/>the worship of Viṣṇu. Agastya had besmeared his
<div n="lb"/>forehead with ashes and so admission to the temple
[Page008-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>was denied to him, by the devotees there who were
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavites. By his own power Agastya turned him-
<div n="lb"/>self into a vaiṣṇavite and got into the temple, and
<div n="lb"/>immediately the image of Viṣṇu in the temple chang-
<div n="lb"/>ed by itself into a Śivaliṅga (idol representing Śiva).
<div n="lb"/>Since then the temple at Kuttālam has remained a
<div n="lb"/>temple of Śiva. Agastya proceeded to the southern-
<div n="lb"/>most point of the earth and sat there and because of
<div n="lb"/>his weight the earth regained its normal position.
<div n="lb"/>(Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Agastya and the Krauñca Mountain.%} When Agastya
<div n="lb"/>passed the Vindhya mountain and proceeded to the
<div n="lb"/>South a Rākṣasa (giant) called Krauñca hindered
<div n="lb"/>his way. By his power the Rākṣasa caused to fall
<div n="lb"/>everywhere a very heavy rain. Agastya sprinkled a
<div n="lb"/>few drops of water from his waterpot on Krauñca,
<div n="lb"/>who instantly became a mountain. Telling him that
<div n="lb"/>he would get deliverance from the curse when the
<div n="lb"/>weapon of Subrahmaṇya struck him, Agastya continu-
<div n="lb"/>ed his journey to the South. (Skanda Purāṇa.).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Agastya and the River Kāveri.%} Once Sūrapadmā,
<div n="lb"/>an Asura (demon) drove the Gods out from heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Indra came to Śiyāli a place in the district of Tanjāvūr
<div n="lb"/>(Tanjore) and began to do penance to please Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Rain was completely stopped. Agastya had com-
<div n="lb"/>pressed the river Kāverī and held the water in his
<div n="lb"/>waterpot. Gaṇapati having come to know of this,
<div n="lb"/>came in the form of a crow and toppled the water-
<div n="lb"/>pot. Agastya got angry and ran after the crow, which
<div n="lb"/>immediately assumed the form of a boy. Agastya caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of him. The boy instantly revealed himself as
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya and granted Agastya a boon. “Your
<div n="lb"/>waterpot will always be full”. Since then there had
<div n="lb"/>never been shortage of water in the Kāverī. (Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Agastya in the palace of Bhadrāśva.%} Once Agastya
<div n="lb"/>lived in the palace of Bhadrāśva as his guest for
<div n="lb"/>seven days. Agastya praised Kāntimatī the queen
<div n="lb"/>on several occasions. The King wanted to know the
<div n="lb"/>reason. Agastya said: During her previous birth
<div n="lb"/>Kāntimatī was the handmaid of a rich man. On
<div n="lb"/>one occasion of dvādaśī (twelfth night after full
<div n="lb"/>moon) in the month of Tulā (second half of Octo-
<div n="lb"/>ber and first half of November) the rich man had
<div n="lb"/>asked his handmaid to see that the lights in a cer-
<div n="lb"/>tain temple did not go out and she did so, in conse-
<div n="lb"/>quence of which, during her current birth she has
<div n="lb"/>become your queen, bearing the name Kāntimatī.
<div n="lb"/>The King and the queen were much pleased at this
<div n="lb"/>explanation of Agastya and thenceforward they
<div n="lb"/>began to observe dvādaśī as a day of fasting. (Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Agastya cursing Urvaśī, Jayanta and Nārada.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>Agastya went to the realm of the Gods, as a guest
<div n="lb"/>of Indra. On that day a performance of dance by
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī was held in honour of Agastya. In the midst
<div n="lb"/>of the dance Urvaśī's eyes fell on Jayanta and she fell
<div n="lb"/>in love with him; her steps went out of beat. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>also went wrong slightly in playing on his famous
<div n="lb"/>lute called Mahatī. Agastya got angry and cursed
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī, Jayanta and Nārada. According to the curse
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta became a bud. Urvaśī was born in the earth
<div n="lb"/>as a woman called Mādhavī and ‘Mahatī’ the lute of
<div n="lb"/>Nārada became the lute of the people of the earth.
[Page009-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Agastya cursing Duṣpanya.%} Duṣpanya was the last
<div n="lb"/>son of the King of Pāṭaliputra. The wicked Duṣpanya
<div n="lb"/>had slain a large number of babies, and the King
<div n="lb"/>therefore expelled him from the palace. Duṣpanya
<div n="lb"/>went into the forest, where he caught hold of the
<div n="lb"/>child of Ugraravas and killed it by putting it under
<div n="lb"/>water. Ugraravas cursed him and accordingly he fell
<div n="lb"/>into water and died and his spirit became a ghost
<div n="lb"/>and wandered about tormented with pain and
<div n="lb"/>anguish. At last the spirit approached Agastya, who
<div n="lb"/>called his disciple Sutīṣṇa and asked him to go and
<div n="lb"/>bathe in the Agnitīrtha (a bath) in the Gandhamā-
<div n="lb"/>dana mountain and bring some water from the tīrtha
<div n="lb"/>and sprinkle it on the spirit of Duṣpanya. Sutīṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>acted accordingly and immediately the spirit of Duṣ-
<div n="lb"/>panya received divine figure and entered heaven. (Setu
<div n="lb"/>Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%How Agastya got golden Bangle.%} Once Agastya
<div n="lb"/>entered a forest of about a hundred yojanas wide. The
<div n="lb"/>forest was devoid of life. When he had walked a few
<div n="lb"/>more steps some Gandharvas (semi-gods) and celestial
<div n="lb"/>maids came there singing and dancing. From among
<div n="lb"/>them a noble male being came forward to the bank of
<div n="lb"/>a lake in the forest and ate without any hesitation, the
<div n="lb"/>corpse of a man that was lying there. After that he
<div n="lb"/>walked round Agastya and made obeisance to him.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya asked him why he had eaten the corpse of a
<div n="lb"/>man. The noble man told Agastya thus: “In tretā
<div n="lb"/>yuga (the third age) there lived a King named Vidarbha.
<div n="lb"/>I am his son and my name is Śveta. After having ruled.
<div n="lb"/>over my kingdom for a long time, I came to the bank
<div n="lb"/>of this lake and began to do penance. After that dis-
<div n="lb"/>carding my body I entered heaven. Though I attained
<div n="lb"/>heaven my hunger was not appeased. I asked Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>how, I, a dweller of heaven, got this hunger. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>said that when I was King I had given nothing to any-
<div n="lb"/>body and so I got this hunger even after entering
<div n="lb"/>heaven. As a remedy Brahmā suggested that I should
<div n="lb"/>come here everyday and eat corpse and when I had
<div n="lb"/>completed ten thousand days the hermit Agastya
<div n="lb"/>would come here and that when I offered him a golden
<div n="lb"/>bangle my sin would be washed away.” Saying thus
<div n="lb"/>Śveta offered to Agastya the golden bangle given by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and then he vanished and the corpse also dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared. Śveta went to heaven. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Other informations concerning Agastya.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Agastya had a brother called Sutīṣṇa. (Agni-
<div n="lb"/>purāṇa, Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Sutīṣṇa was Agastya's disciple too. (Setu Māhā-
<div n="lb"/>tmya).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Ilvala and Vātāpi were the sons of the giantess
<div n="lb"/>Ajamukhī. In the valley of a mountain Ajamukhī pray-
<div n="lb"/>ed to Durvāsas for love and thus Ilvala and Vātāpi
<div n="lb"/>were born from Durvāsas. These two sons demanded
<div n="lb"/>that Durvāsas should impart to them all his merits of
<div n="lb"/>penance. Getting angry Durvāsas cursed them that
<div n="lb"/>they would meet with death at the hands of Agastya.
<div n="lb"/>(Skandapurāṇa, Āsura Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Agastya had been the priest of the King Khela.
<div n="lb"/>(Ṛgveda, 112th Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>(5) When Śrī Rāma returned to Ayodhyā, with Sītā
<div n="lb"/>from Laṅkā, hermits from various parts visited him,
<div n="lb"/>among whom, Dattātreya, Namuci, Pramuci, Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki, Soma, Kaṇḍu, Agastya and their disciples
<div n="lb"/>were from the South. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
[Page009-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(6) Agastya gave Śrī Rāma an arrow, which, when
<div n="lb"/>shot at an asura (demon) would pierce his heart, pass
<div n="lb"/>on to the other side, fly to the sea and bathe in the
<div n="lb"/>sea-water and return to the quiver, it is said. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Once Agastya visited the hermitage of Āpasṭamba.
<div n="lb"/>He asked Agastya, who, of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>was the Supreme deity. Agastya replied: “These three
<div n="lb"/>are only three different manifestations of the one
<div n="lb"/>supreme Being”. (Brahmapurāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(8) For the story of how Agastya cursed the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Maṇibhadra and transformed them to seven palms,
<div n="lb"/>see the word ‘Saptasāla’.
<div n="NI"/>(9) There was a hermit called Sutīṣṇa, to whom Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa paid a visit when they were
<div n="lb"/>wandering in the forest. This Sutīṣṇa is the young-
<div n="lb"/>er brother of Agastya. (See the word Sutīṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Agastya cursed Śuka and deformed him into a
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa. (See the word Śuka ii.).
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Conclusion.%} It is believed that the great hermit
<div n="lb"/>Agastya, who had performed such wonderful deeds by
<div n="lb"/>the merits of his penance, is still doing penance in the
<div n="lb"/>Agastya Kūṭa hills. Agastya who had travelled through-
<div n="lb"/>out the length and breadth of Bhārata had several
<div n="lb"/>hermitages. In the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Āraṇyakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 11, a description is given, of a beautiful hermit-
<div n="lb"/>age of Agastya, and the peaceful atmosphere that
<div n="lb"/>prevailed in and around it. Agastya had presented to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma a bow got from Viṣṇu, when the brothers
<div n="lb"/>visited his hermitage. Agastya had accompanied Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and his followers on his return journey to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā from Laṅkā, with Sītā after killing Rāvaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>There is a legend in the Tamilnād that Agastya was a
<div n="lb"/>member of the first two ‘Saṅghas’ (groups) of the
<div n="lb"/>“three Saṅghas”, mentioned in Tamil literature. As
<div n="lb"/>Agastya was dwarfish he is mentioned as Kurumuni,
<div n="lb"/>(short hermit) in Tamil works. He has written a Tamil
<div n="lb"/>grammar on music, literature and drama. But this
<div n="lb"/>work is not available now. The Tamil Grammar
<div n="lb"/>‘Tolkāpyam’, which is considered to be the oldest gram-
<div n="lb"/>mar, was written by Tolkāpyār, one of the twelve
<div n="lb"/>disciples of Agastya. Even today in certain temples in
<div n="lb"/>the Tamilnād, Agastya-worship is carried on. Kambar,
<div n="lb"/>has mentioned about Agastya in his Rāmāyaṇa. A great
<div n="lb"/>Tamil author Villiputturan says that the Tamil langu-
<div n="lb"/>age is the beautiful maiden presented by Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that the following works have been com-
<div n="lb"/>posed by Agastya:
<div n="NI"/>1) Agastya Gītā; in the Varāhapurāṇa, Paśupālopākh-
<div n="lb"/>yāna.
<div n="NI"/>2) Agastya Saṃhitā; in Pañcarātra.
<div n="NI"/>3) Agastya Saṃhitā, in the Skandapurāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>4) Śiva Saṃhitā, in Bhāskara Saṃhitā.
<div n="NI"/>5) Dvaidha-nirṇaya Tantra.
