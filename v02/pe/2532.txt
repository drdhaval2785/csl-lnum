GUṆAŚARMAN¦. A character of the Purāṇas well versed
<div n="lb"/>in all arts and sciences. He was the son of the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>Ādityaśarman of Ujjayinī. The birth of Guṇaśarman
<div n="lb"/>bears a story. Once Ādityaśarman went to the forests and
<div n="lb"/>by his spiritual powers made Sulocanā, a celestial
<div n="lb"/>nymph, to merge with him. A son was born to them
<div n="lb"/>and he was named Guṇaśarman. Ādityaśarman
<div n="lb"/>became a deva. Even from boyhood he became very
<div n="lb"/>erudite. Once Indra came to see Ādityaśarman. Āditya-
<div n="lb"/>śarman who was in deep thoughts did not see Indra
<div n="lb"/>and so did not rise up when Indra came. Indra felt
<div n="lb"/>insulted and cursed him to be born again on Earth.
<div n="lb"/>Ādityaśarman prostrated before Indra and asked for
<div n="lb"/>pardon. Indra then said that it would be enough if
<div n="lb"/>his son was born on Earth in his stead. So Guṇaśarman
<div n="lb"/>was born on Earth to bear the curse of his father.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Ujjayinī was being ruled over by a King
<div n="lb"/>called Mahāsena. He had a very beautiful wife named
<div n="lb"/>Aśokavatī. Guṇaśarman became gradually an intimate
<div n="lb"/>friend of the King. Knowing that Guṇaśarman was
<div n="lb"/>well versed in all arts the King and queen asked him
<div n="lb"/>to give them a performance in dancing. The dance
<div n="lb"/>was so excellent that the King engaged Guṇaśarman to
<div n="lb"/>teach dancing to Aśokavatī.
<div n="NI"/>Once a royal attendant tried to give poisoned food to
<div n="lb"/>the King and Guṇaśarman finding it out saved the
<div n="lb"/>King. From that day onwards the King loved him
<div n="lb"/>more. When once Mahāsena was imprisoned by his
<div n="lb"/>enemies Guṇaśarman by his magic powers released
<div n="lb"/>him. In return for this help the King gave Guṇaśar-
<div n="lb"/>man a thousand villages.
<div n="NI"/>Then to the misfortune of all Aśokavatī fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with Guṇaśarman. Guṇaśarman bluntly refused her
<div n="lb"/>love. Embittered at this Aśokavatī started talking ill of
<div n="lb"/>Guṇaśarman and the King at last sent Guṇaśarman out
<div n="lb"/>from the palace. The servants of the King tried to
<div n="lb"/>capture him and put him into prison but Guṇaśarman
<div n="lb"/>escaped from the royal servants by his magic powers.
<div n="NI"/>He then went and stayed in the house of a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Agnidattā and married his daughter, Sundari.
<div n="lb"/>Then on the advice of the brahmin Guṇaśraman did
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Subrahmaṇya and got many
<div n="lb"/>more powers from him. Gunaśarman equipped with
<div n="lb"/>these additional powers conquered Mahāsena and his
<div n="lb"/>country and became King there. He then sent Mahāsena
<div n="lb"/>and his wife Aśokavatī, out from the country. (Sūrya-
<div n="lb"/>prabhālaṃbaka, Taraṅga 6, Kathāsaritsāgara).
