KAŚYAPA I¦. Chief among the Prajāpatis.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Kaśyapa—Son or Grandson of Brahmā?%} It is impossible
<div n="lb"/>to give a definite answer to this question. In Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, we see that six spirit-
<div n="lb"/>ual sons—Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and
<div n="lb"/>Kratu—were born to Brahmā. Kaśyapa was born as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Marīci and that all living beings in the
<div n="lb"/>world took their origin from Kaśyapa. According to
<div n="lb"/>this statement, Kaśyapa is the grandson of Brahmā.
[Page396-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>But in the 14th Sarga of Araṇyakāṇḍa in Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa there is an account of the creation of all
<div n="lb"/>animate and inanimate objects in this world. According
<div n="lb"/>to a statement in that passage, we find that Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>was the youngest brother of Marīci, Atri, Pulastya and
<div n="lb"/>others. This means that Kaśyapa was the son of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore there is nothing wrong in regarding him
<div n="lb"/>either as the son or as the grandson of Brahmā. In the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas we find references to him in both ways.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Original Gotra or Clan.%} Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 297, verse 17 says that all living beings belong
<div n="lb"/>to the four original Gotras—the gotra of Aṅgiras,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa gotra, Bhṛgu gotra and Vasiṣṭha gotra and
<div n="lb"/>that all the other gotras came into existence subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaśyapa's wives.%} Kaśyapa had 21 wives who were:—
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ariṣṭā, Surasā. Khaśā, Surabhi,
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Irā, Kadrū, Muni,
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā, Kālakā, Natā, Danāyus, Siṃhikā, Pradhā,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvā, and Kapilā. Of these, the 13 wives, Aditi, Diti,
<div n="lb"/>Kālakā, Danāyus, Danu, Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pradhā,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā, Muni and Kadrū, were the
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Of these the first wife Aditi had 12 sons. These 12 sons
<div n="lb"/>namely Viṣṇu, Śakra, Aryamā, Dhātā, Tvaṣṭā, Pūṣā,
<div n="lb"/>Vivasvān, Savitā, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aṃśa and Bhaga are
<div n="lb"/>called Ādityas (sons of Aditi). In the sixth Manvantara
<div n="lb"/>these 12 Ādityas belonged to the tribe known as Tuṣitas.
<div n="lb"/>(The present Manvantara is the seventh one). The 33
<div n="lb"/>crores of Devas came into being from the twelve
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas.
<div n="NI"/>The Daityas were born from Kaśyapa's second wife
<div n="lb"/>Diti. The chief Daityas are Hiraṇyakaśipu, Hiraṇyākṣa
<div n="lb"/>and Siṃhikā. All the other Daityas were born from
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>The Dānavas were the children of Danu, another wife
<div n="lb"/>of Kaśyapa. Dvimūrdhā, Śambara, Ayomukha, Śaṅku-
<div n="lb"/>śiras, Kapila, Śaṅkara, Ekacakra, Mahābāhu, Tāraka,
<div n="lb"/>Mahābala, Svarbhānu, Vṛṣaparvā, Pulomā, and Vipra-
<div n="lb"/>citti are the famous Dānavas. The other Dānavas were
<div n="lb"/>the children of the people mentioned above.
<div n="NI"/>Another wife of Kaśyapa, Surabhi gave birth to Aja,
<div n="lb"/>Ekapād, Ahirbuddhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra and also
<div n="lb"/>the Ekādaśa Rudras namely:—Hara, Bahurūpa, Tryam-
<div n="lb"/>baka, Aparājita, Vṛṣākapi, Śambhu, Kapardī, Raivata,
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgavyādha, Sarpa, and Kapālī. Vinatā gave birth to
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa and Kadrū was the mother of the nāgas. The
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas proclaim that all living beings that we see in
<div n="lb"/>the world today, sprang from Kaśyapa's offsprings by
<div n="lb"/>his different wives. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 29; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapters 15-21;
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapters 16 and 65 and
<div n="lb"/>Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Brahmā taught Kaśyapa cure for snake poison.%} The ser-
<div n="lb"/>pents (Nāgas) were born to Kadrū, one of the wives
<div n="lb"/>of Kaśyapa. Once Kadrū asked her children to hang
<div n="lb"/>down like hair from the tail of Uccaiśśravas. They
<div n="lb"/>refused to do so. Kadrū became angry and cursed them
<div n="lb"/>that they would be burnt alive at Janamejaya's Sarpa
<div n="lb"/>Sattra (snake-sacrifice). After the curse, the Nāgas
<div n="lb"/>became dangerously venomous. At this stage, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>taught Kaśyapa the art of curing snake-poison to
<div n="lb"/>protect other creatures that might be bitten by the
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas. Cure of snake-bite in this world dates from
<div n="lb"/>that time. (M.B. Ādi Parva. Chapter 20).
[Page397-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaśy pa and Garuḍa.%} Garuḍa is a mighty son of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa by his wife Vinatā. Vinatā made a bet with
<div n="lb"/>her sister Kadrū. Kadrū won the bet. Vinatā became
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū's maid-servant as a result of the bet. To be
<div n="lb"/>relieved of this bondage Vinatā's son Garuḍa had to
<div n="lb"/>bring Amṛta from Devaloka and give it to Kadrū and
<div n="lb"/>her Nāga-sons. Garuḍa agreed and flew up to Heaven
<div n="lb"/>to fetch Amṛta.
<div n="NI"/>On the way, he visited his father Kaśyapa who was
<div n="lb"/>performing penance on the Gandhamādana mountain.
<div n="lb"/>He asked his father to give him some food, as he was
<div n="lb"/>very hungry. Kaśyapa told him the following story:—
<div n="lb"/>“Long ago a sage named Vibhāvasu lived near this place.
<div n="lb"/>He and his younger brother named Supratīka began to
<div n="lb"/>quarrel over the sharing of their father's wealth. The
<div n="lb"/>elder brother transformed the younger brother into an
<div n="lb"/>elephant by a curse and the younger brother turned
<div n="lb"/>the elder into a tortoise by his curse. They are still
<div n="lb"/>living in yonder lake as elephant and tortoise and
<div n="lb"/>continue like enemies. If you eat both of them, you will
<div n="lb"/>be strong enough to fight against the Devas and get
<div n="lb"/>possession of Amṛta for yourself.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Garuḍa went to the lake and caught
<div n="lb"/>the elephant and tortoise in his claws and flew up into
<div n="lb"/>the sky. The mountains began to tremble and a whirl-
<div n="lb"/>wind swept the Heavens when Garuḍa beat with his
<div n="lb"/>wings. He flew about here and there unable to find a
<div n="lb"/>convenient place to sit and enjoy his meal. On the way,
<div n="lb"/>his eye caught sight of a huge banyan tree spreading its
<div n="lb"/>branches far and wide, to a distance of 100 yojanas
<div n="lb"/>around it. When he perched on one of its branches
<div n="lb"/>with the elephant and tortoise, the branch broke and
<div n="lb"/>fell down. From that branch certain sages known as
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas were hanging with their heads downwards.
<div n="lb"/>So, to prevent them from falling to the ground, Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>lifted it in his beak and began to fly up again. Unable
<div n="lb"/>to find a suitable spot where he could deposit the
<div n="lb"/>branch with the sages, Garuḍa returned to his father
<div n="lb"/>again. At the request of Kaśyapa, the Bālakhilyas went
<div n="lb"/>to the Himālayas. He showed Garuḍa a vast, snow-
<div n="lb"/>clad mountain on which he could deposit the broken
<div n="lb"/>branch he was carrying. Garuḍa flew to that mountain
<div n="lb"/>and ate up the elephant and tortoise and thus gained
<div n="lb"/>strength to fight with the Devas for Amṛta. After that
<div n="lb"/>he proceeded to Heaven. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>29-31).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other Birth of Kaśyapa.%} In Cākṣuṣa Manvantara, the
<div n="lb"/>sage Sutapas performed a penance along with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Pṛśni for 12,000 years. Lord Viṣṇu appeared to them
<div n="lb"/>and asked what boon they wished to ask. They prayed
<div n="lb"/>that the Lord should take birth as their son. Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>granted their prayer and was born as their son.
<div n="NI"/>In the next Manvantara (the period of Vaivasvata
<div n="lb"/>Manu) Sutapas and Pṛśni were re-born as Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>and Aditi respectively. At that time also Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was born to Aditi as Vāmana. (See under Vāmana).
<div n="lb"/>In this birth, Kaśyapa had many other wives besides
<div n="lb"/>Aditi. Surasā was one of those wives. (Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>It was this Kaśyapa himself who was reborn as Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>deva and Aditi became Devakī. Surasā was born as
<div n="lb"/>Rohiṇī, another wife. There is another reason for
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa and Aditi to take birth for the third time.
<div n="lb"/>Once Kaśyapa had prepared to perform a Yāga. All
<div n="lb"/>arrangements were complete. But the sacrificial cow
[Page397-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>alone was not available. Kaśyapa solved the problem
<div n="lb"/>by stealing a cow from Varuṇa's cattle-shed. Aditi and
<div n="lb"/>Surasā concealed it in the Āśrama. Enraged at the
<div n="lb"/>theft of his cow, Varuṇa complained to Brahmā. A
<div n="lb"/>curse was pronounced by Brahmā and Varuṇa that as
<div n="lb"/>a punishment for stealing and hiding the cow, Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>should be reborn as a cowherd and Aditi and Surasā
<div n="lb"/>should be reborn as the cowherd's wives. It was by
<div n="lb"/>this curse that Kaśyapa, Aditi and Surasā were reborn
<div n="lb"/>as Vasudeva Devakī and Rohiṇī respectively. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Paraśurāma's gift of land to Kaśyapa.%} Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>performed a Yāga after exterminating all Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>Kings. At that Yāga he gifted all the lands he had
<div n="lb"/>conquered till then to Kaśyapa. In Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Parva, Chapter 117, there is a reference to this
<div n="lb"/>gift.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kaśyapa and Kerala.%} After Paraśurāma went round
<div n="lb"/>the world eighteen times and exterminated the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya Kings he performed a Yāga. At that Yāga he
<div n="lb"/>gave the whole earth as dakṣiṇā to Kaśyapa. After that,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa drove away Paraśurāma from the earth to
<div n="lb"/>the south. Taking pity on Paraśurāma, the ocean gave
<div n="lb"/>him the region known as “Śūrpāraka”. Kaśyapa seized
<div n="lb"/>Śūrpāraka also from Paraśurāma and gave it to
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas. Paraśurāma went to the forests after it.
<div n="lb"/>Later on, intermixture of castes took place in this region
<div n="lb"/>and anarchy prevailed there. At one time, Śūrpāraka
<div n="lb"/>sank down into Pātāla (lower world). Kaśyapa who
<div n="lb"/>saw this held the earth up, brought Kṣatriyas from the
<div n="lb"/>north and made them rulers of the country. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 49). This “Śūrpāraka” is believed
<div n="lb"/>to be Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other Details about Kaśyapa.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kaśyapa arrived at the place of Arjuna's birth
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by other sages. (Mahābhārata, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 122).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kaśyapa flourished in Brahmā's assembly. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once there was a dispute between Virocana, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Prahlāda and Sudhanvā, the son of Aṅgiras. It
<div n="lb"/>was Kaśyapa who settled this dispute. (See the 5th
<div n="lb"/>Para under the word Aṅgiras).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Kaśyapa went on a pilgrimage in the
<div n="lb"/>company of Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>85).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Brahmā gifted the entire earth to Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>at a Yajña. Bhūmidevī (Goddess of the earth) who
<div n="lb"/>was distressed at it, went to Pātāla and began to
<div n="lb"/>lament. At that time Kaśyapa propitiated the goddess
<div n="lb"/>by his austere penance. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>114).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) After Paraśurāma had given the entire earth to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, Kaśyapa drove away Paraśurāma from the
<div n="lb"/>earth. Paraśurāma then shot an arrow into the sea
<div n="lb"/>and converted that portion of the sea into land. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva, Chapter 70, Verses 18 and 19).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) When the war between Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>was in progress, Kaśyapa approached Droṇa and
<div n="lb"/>wanted him to bring the battle to a close. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva, Chapter 190).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Kaśyapa was also present with other sages at
<div n="lb"/>the time of Skanda's birth. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>45).
[Page398-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Kaśyapa once gave some pieces of advice to
<div n="lb"/>Purūravas. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 73).
<div n="NI"/>(x) In the 8th verse of Chapter 208 of Śānti Parva, in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, we find that Kaśyapa had another name
<div n="lb"/>Ariṣṭanemi.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) Kaśyapa once related to Bhīṣma, the story of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu's Varāhāvatāra. (Incarnation as Boar).
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 209, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) Bhāṣā Bhārata says that gingelly seeds were first
<div n="lb"/>introduced into this world from sage Kaśyapa's body.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 10).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) Kaśyapa explained to Vṛṣādarbhi, the evil of
<div n="lb"/>receiving pratigraha (presents). (M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 93).
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) Kaśyapa once spoke to Arundhatī about the
<div n="lb"/>weakness of his body. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>93, Verse 65).
<div n="NI"/>(xv) At another time, Agastya suspected that Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>had stolen his lotus. But Kaśyapa swore that he was
<div n="lb"/>innocent. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 94).
<div n="NI"/>(xvi) In Bhāṣā Bhārata it is said that Kaśyapa was
<div n="lb"/>one of the Sapta Gurus (seven Preceptors) of Kubera.
<div n="lb"/>The other six Gurus were—Vasiṣṭha, Atri, Gautama,
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni. M.B. Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva, Chapter 150).
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) In Bhāgavata we see that Kaśyapa and other
<div n="lb"/>sages were instrumental in bringing about the destruc-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Yadu Vaṃśa. (For further details see under
<div n="lb"/>SĀMBA).
