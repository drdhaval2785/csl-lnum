GĀNDHĀRĪ¦. Wife of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There was a King called Subala in the family
<div n="lb"/>of Turvasu, brother of Yadu. (For genealogy see under
<div n="lb"/>Subala). Subala became the King of the land of Gān-
<div n="lb"/>dhāra. This land extended from the river Sindhu to
<div n="lb"/>Kābul. Gāndhārī was the daughter of Subala. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 111, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Gāndhārī became a devotee of Śiva even
<div n="lb"/>from her childhood. Śiva became pleased with her and
<div n="lb"/>blessed her saying that she would bear a hundred sons.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma came to know of this and he planned to get her
<div n="lb"/>married to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. One day he sent a messenger
<div n="lb"/>to Subala making a proposal. Subala knew that Dhṛ-
<div n="lb"/>tarāṣṭra was born blind but considering his lineage and
<div n="lb"/>the powerful alliance it would make, consented to the
<div n="lb"/>proposal of Bhīṣma. Śakuni, brother of Gāndhārī, then
<div n="lb"/>by the order of his father took Gāndhārī to Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura and Dhṛtarāṣṭra accepted her as his wife. Gān-
<div n="lb"/>dhārī obeying his father's instructions without a demur
<div n="lb"/>accepted her blind husband with such devotion that
<div n="lb"/>she made herself blind by tightly covering her eyes
<div n="lb"/>with a silk shawl. (Chapter 110, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth of Sons.%} Once Vyāsa came to her exhausted
<div n="lb"/>with hunger and thirst. Gāndhārī appeased his hunger
<div n="lb"/>and thirst with tasty things to eat and drink. Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>was immensely pleased and he also blessed her and
<div n="lb"/>said she would get a hundred sons. Very soon she be-
<div n="lb"/>came pregnant. But even after two years she did not
<div n="lb"/>deliver, while Kuntī, wife of Pāṇḍu, gave birth to a
<div n="lb"/>son. Grief-stricken, she hit hardly on her womb secretly
<div n="lb"/>and then a great mass of flesh came out. Then Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>appeared before her and advised her to cut the lump
<div n="lb"/>of flesh into a hundred pieces and deposit one each in
<div n="lb"/>a jar of ghee. Vyāsa himself cut it into pieces. Gān-
<div n="lb"/>dhārī expressed a desire to have a girl also. Vyāsa cut
<div n="lb"/>it into hundred and one pieces and put them in hundred
[Page275-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and one jars of ghee. In due time the jars broke and
<div n="lb"/>a hundred sons and a daughter came out of the jars.
<div n="lb"/>The daughter was named Duśśalā. For their name see
<div n="lb"/>‘Kauravas’. Dhṛtarāṣṭra got another son named Yuyu-
<div n="lb"/>tsu. (Chapters 115 and 116, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gāndharī faints.%} When Sañjaya reported about the
<div n="lb"/>death of Karṇa at the battle both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī fainted. (Śloka 55, Chapter 96, Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Gāndhārī starts to curse the Pāṇḍavas.%} When the battle
<div n="lb"/>was over the sons of Gāndhārī and their followers were
<div n="lb"/>killed. Dhṛtarāṣṭra suggested that the Pāṇḍavas should
<div n="lb"/>visit Gāndhārī and pay homage to her. The Pāṇḍavas,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, went and stood before Gāndhārī very res-
<div n="lb"/>pectfully. Vengeance boiled in her heart and her body
<div n="lb"/>shivered. Gāndhārī was about to curse the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>when Vyāsa, intervened saying “Gāndhārī! Don't you
<div n="lb"/>remember you said that victory would lie on the side
<div n="lb"/>of the righteous in this war? Your words are not wasted.
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas won the battle because right was on
<div n="lb"/>their side. So why should you get agitated?” Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>became calm on hearing these words and she admitted
<div n="lb"/>that the end of the Kuru dynasty came because of the
<div n="lb"/>mistakes of Duryodhana, Śakuni, Karṇa and Duśśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana. She, thereafter, treated the Pāṇḍavas as her own
<div n="lb"/>sons. (Chapter 14, Strī Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Dharmaputra's foot-nails become blue.%} Following the
<div n="lb"/>instructions of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the Pāṇḍavas, approached
<div n="lb"/>and bowed before Gāndhārī. She covered her face
<div n="lb"/>with a cloth and wept, tears rolling down her cheeks.
<div n="lb"/>When Dharmaputra bent to touch her feet the latter
<div n="lb"/>saw through the veil on her face the foot-nails of
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra. A few drops of the lachrymal water fell
<div n="lb"/>on the foot-nails of Dharmaputra making them turn
<div n="lb"/>blue instantly. (Chapter 15, Strī Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Gāndhārī curses Kṛṣṇa.%} At the end of the battle the
<div n="lb"/>aggrieved Gāndhārī went to Kurukṣetra together with
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and other relatives. Seeing mighty Kings on the
<div n="lb"/>Kaurava side lying dead like huge trees lying truncated
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī burst into tears. She knew that Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was at the root of all this. Embittered she looked at
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and cursed him. “Ho, Kṛṣṇa, thirtysix years
<div n="lb"/>from this day you will lose your sons, ministers, friends
<div n="lb"/>and relatives. You will become a lone walker in the
<div n="lb"/>forests and be killed by trickery.”
<div n="NI"/>It was because of this curse that the Yādava tribe perish-
<div n="lb"/>ed and Kṛṣṇa was struck by the arrow of a hunter
<div n="lb"/>which made him end his life on earth.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The end of Gāndhārī.%} After the great Kurukṣetra battle
<div n="lb"/>heart-broken Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by Kuntī, Vidura and Sañjaya went to the forests to
<div n="lb"/>spend the rest of their life there. Many people and the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas accompanied them up to the river Gaṅgā and
<div n="lb"/>there near the āśrama of Śatayūpa Dhṛtarāṣṭra made
<div n="lb"/>a hut and lived with Gāndhārī and Kuntī.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas felt the separation of their relatives
<div n="lb"/>unbearable and lived in grief. After six years one day
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra saw his mother, Kuntī, in a dream. He
<div n="lb"/>told his brothers about this and they all felt a desire
<div n="lb"/>to go to the forest and see their mother. The next day they
<div n="lb"/>reached the shores of Gaṅgā. Vyāsa also joined them.
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī and Kuntī expressed a desire to Vyāsa that
<div n="lb"/>they would like to see the dead sons and relatives once
<div n="lb"/>again. Vyāsa then asked them to go and take a dip
<div n="lb"/>in the river. When they rose up after a dip they saw
[Page275-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>standing on the shores of the river the great warriors
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa and Duryodhana and others. By the yogic power
<div n="lb"/>of Vyāsa even the blind Dhṛtarāṣṭra could get the vision.
<div n="lb"/>Very soon the vision faded and the Pāṇḍavas returned
<div n="lb"/>to Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>Two days after, fire broke out in the forest where
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra was staying. Dhṛtarāṣtra, Kuntī and
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī were burnt to death in that fire. (Chapter 32,
<div n="lb"/>Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%After the death.%} Dharmaputra performed the obsequi-
<div n="lb"/>es of those who died in the wild fire (Āśramavāsika
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 30). Leaving the mortal bodies the souls of
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī entered Kuberaloka. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>14, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Synonyms of Gāndhārī.%} The following words have
<div n="lb"/>been used in the Mahābhārata to denote Gāndhārī;
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārarājaduhitā, Saubaleyī, Saubalī, Subalajā,
<div n="lb"/>Subalāputrī and Subalātmajā.
