TEJASVATĪ I¦. A heroine in a story in Kathāsaritsāgara
<div n="lb"/>intended to show that all happenings either good or bad
<div n="lb"/>are but the workings of fate.
<div n="NI"/>Tejasvatī was the daughter of king Vikramasena of
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayinī and was very beautiful. She never liked any
<div n="lb"/>male and so never wished to marry. One day while
<div n="lb"/>she was sitting upstairs in her palace, she happened to
<div n="lb"/>see a young man passing that way and surprisingly was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by him. She sent her companion to him and
<div n="lb"/>informed him of her liking for him. He did not like the
<div n="lb"/>idea first, but the clever persuasions of the maid made
<div n="lb"/>him agree to a clandestine meeting with the princess at
<div n="lb"/>a temple at night that day. Tejasvatī anxiously waited
<div n="lb"/>for the night to come.
<div n="NI"/>About that time a Rajput prince greatly grieved at the
<div n="lb"/>loss of his father and subsequent loss of his kingdom
<div n="lb"/>started on a tour to see an old friend of his father. That
<div n="lb"/>night, by sheer accident, he came and rested in the
<div n="lb"/>same temple where the rendezvous of the princess was
<div n="lb"/>fixed. When night fell the princess came to the temple
[Page788-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and without the least suspicion went and embraced the
<div n="lb"/>solitary figure sitting in the temple. The prince did
<div n="lb"/>not show any surprise and responded fully. The prin-
<div n="lb"/>cess then understood all details of her lover and
<div n="lb"/>took him to his father the next morning. Somadatta
<div n="lb"/>(that was the prince's name) then told Vikramasena all
<div n="lb"/>his mishaps and Vikramasena got back all the lost king-
<div n="lb"/>dom of Somadatta and also gave his daughter in mar-
<div n="lb"/>riage to him. (Taraṅga 4, Madana Mañcukālambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara).
