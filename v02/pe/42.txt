AGASTYA¦ KŪṬA. This is the sacred mount where
<div n="lb"/>the sage, Agastya, sat and did penance during his so-
<div n="lb"/>journ in the southern parts of India. In the Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa we find King Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>commanding that all his soldiers going in search of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā should pay homage to the sage Agastya.
