REVATĪ IV¦. The mother of Raivata, the lord of the fifth
<div n="lb"/>Manvantara (age of a Manu). There is a story in the
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa about the birth of Revatī.
<div n="NI"/>A son was born to the hermit Ṛtavāk on Revatī day.
<div n="NI"/>By and by he became wicked. Having learned from
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Garga that his son became wicked because
<div n="lb"/>he was born under the star Revatī, Ṛtavāk cursed the
<div n="lb"/>star Revatī and kicked it down from its place. The spot
<div n="lb"/>on which the star fell became a lake. After a time a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful damsel was born from the lake. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>Pramuca took the girl home and brought her up.
<div n="lb"/>She was called Revatī. When she came of age, she was
<div n="lb"/>given in marriage to Durgama, the son of king
<div n="lb"/>Vikramaśīla. At the request of Revatī her marriage was
<div n="lb"/>conducted at an auspicious moment on the day of the
<div n="lb"/>star Revatī. The hermit blessed the couple “Let a son,
<div n="lb"/>who would become the Lord of the Manvantara, be
<div n="lb"/>born to you.” As a result of this blessing the bright and
<div n="lb"/>valiant son Raivata was born to them. This Raivata
<div n="lb"/>was the Lord of the fifth Manvantara.
