PṚTHŪDARA¦. A celebrated Yakṣa. This Yakṣa got a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Saudāminī. Her father took her to
<div n="lb"/>different mountains to entertain her. One day while
<div n="lb"/>she was playing with her companion Kapiśabhrū she
<div n="lb"/>met a Yaksaputra named Aṭṭahāsa. They fell in love
<div n="lb"/>and Saudāminī's father agreed to their marriage and
<div n="lb"/>fixed it. After fixing the marriage Pṛthūdara took his
<div n="lb"/>daughter to his house. Next day her companion Kapi-
<div n="lb"/>śabhrū came to Saudāminī in a sorrowful mood and
<div n="lb"/>when she asked her the reason she said “Friend, how
<div n="lb"/>am I to report to you this sad news. On my way to you
<div n="lb"/>I passed through a garden named Citrasthala in the
<div n="lb"/>valley of the Himālayas. To have some sport with the
<div n="lb"/>love-stricken Aṭṭahāsa his friends staged a drama in
<div n="lb"/>which Aṭṭahāsa was made Vaiśravaṇarāja and his brother
<div n="lb"/>Dīptaśikha, Nalakūbara, and the rest, his ministers.
<div n="lb"/>They were thus acting and enjoying when Nalakūbara
<div n="lb"/>himself came that way and seeing his servant
<div n="lb"/>Aṭṭahāsa in the robes and form of his father was
<div n="lb"/>angry and calling Aṭṭahāsa to his side said: “A servant
<div n="lb"/>like you is ambitious of becoming a king. Let this ambi-
<div n="lb"/>tion be the cause of your downfall. You will be born
<div n="lb"/>as man.” Aṭṭahāsa was shocked and he craved pardon
<div n="lb"/>“Oh Lord, I did this only for some entertainment. I did
<div n="lb"/>not do it with any desire for a big position. Pardon
<div n="lb"/>me for my mistake. Nalakūbara then by his divine
<div n="lb"/>power understood everything and taking pity on him
<div n="lb"/>consoled him and said “She with whom you are in love
<div n="lb"/>will be your wife in your life as man. Your brother

<div n="lb"/>Dīptaśikha will then be born as your son. Both of
<div n="lb"/>you will then be released from the curse. Dīptaśikha
<div n="lb"/>after ruling the country for some time will also be free
<div n="lb"/>from this curse.” Aṭṭahāsa and Dīptaśikha soon dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared by the power of the curse.
<div n="NI"/>Aṭṭahāsa was born as king of Trigartta in the name of
<div n="lb"/>Pavitradhara and Saudāminī became his wife. A son
<div n="lb"/>was born to them named Dīptaśikha and as soon as he
<div n="lb"/>was born the parents were released from the curse and
<div n="lb"/>entered heaven. (Śaśāṅkavatīlambaka, Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara, Taraṅga 6).
