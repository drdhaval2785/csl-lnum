MANVANTARA¦(M).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Kalpa, Manvantara and Caturyuga.%} The Prapañca
<div n="lb"/>(universe) is perishable. At one time, it takes its origin,
<div n="lb"/>at another time it perishes. Brahmā, the creator of
<div n="lb"/>the universe has birth and death. The period between
<div n="lb"/>the birth and death of a Brahmā is known as a “Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>kalpa”. The flood that comes at the death of a Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>is called “Mahāpralaya”. One day of Brahmā is called
<div n="lb"/>Kalpakāla. In the Purāṇas one Kalpa or one day of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā is divided into fourteen parts. The master or
<div n="lb"/>ruler of each of these divisions is a Manu. There are
<div n="lb"/>fourteen Manus. The life span of each Manu is called
<div n="lb"/>a “Manvantaram”.
<div n="NI"/>There are seventy one Caturyugas in each Manvantara.
<div n="lb"/>The four yugas namely Kṛtayuga, Tretāyuga, Dvāpara-
<div n="lb"/>yuga and Kaliyuga make up one Caturyuga. At the end
<div n="lb"/>of seventy-one such Caturyugas, that is, at the end of
<div n="lb"/>every two hundred and eightyfour (71 × 4) yugas, a
<div n="lb"/>Manu completes his life-span. Along with that, the
<div n="lb"/>Devas who were born at the time of the birth of that
<div n="lb"/>Manu, also come to the end of their lives. Fourteen such
<div n="lb"/>Manvantaras make one day of Brahmā. It is at the end
<div n="lb"/>of that day that the original universe perishes. Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>life-span is 120 years. At the end of that period, that
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā perishes. That is to say, at the end of every
[Page482-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>42,200 divine days (120 × 360) which is the life-span of
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmā, a deluge takes place. Thus in one Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>time 42,200 Kalpas take place. A Brahmā's life span
<div n="lb"/>is known as “Mahākalpa” and the close of a Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>period is called “Mahāpralaya”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Human year (Manuṣya varṣa) and Divine year (Deva%}
<div n="lb"/>{%varṣa).%} When two leaves are placed one over the other
<div n="lb"/>and they are pierced by a needle, the time required
<div n="lb"/>for the needle to pass from the first leaf to the second
<div n="lb"/>is called “Alpakāla”. Thirty such alpakālas make one
<div n="lb"/>“Truṭi”. Thirty truṭis make one “Kalā”. Thirty Kalās
<div n="lb"/>make one “Kāṣṭhā”, which is also known as “Nimiṣa”
<div n="lb"/>“Noṭi” or “Mātrā”. Four “Nimiṣas” make one
<div n="lb"/>“Gaṇita”. Ten Gaṇitas, one “Neṭuvīrppu”. Six neṭu-
<div n="lb"/>vīrppus, one “Vināzhikā”. Sixty vināzhikās one
<div n="lb"/>“Ghaṭikā”. Sixty ghaṭikās one day (day and night
<div n="lb"/>together). Fifteen days, one “Pakṣa”. Two Pakṣas, one
<div n="lb"/>“Cāndra māsa” (lunar month). One Cāndramāsa for
<div n="lb"/>human beings is one “ahorātra” (one day and night
<div n="lb"/>making up one full day) for the pitṛs. Twelve Cāndra
<div n="lb"/>māsas make one year for human beings. One year for
<div n="lb"/>human beings is one ahorātra for the gods. Three
<div n="lb"/>hundred ahorātras of gods make one “Deva Vatsara”
<div n="lb"/>or “Divya vatsara”. 4,800 divyavatsaras make one Kṛta-
<div n="lb"/>yuga. 3,600 divyavatsaras make one Tretāyuga, 2,400
<div n="lb"/>divyavatsaras make one Dvāparayuga. 1,200 divya-
<div n="lb"/>vatsaras make one Kaliyuga. 12,000 divyavatsaras
<div n="lb"/>comprising a set of Kṛta, Tretā. Dvāpara and Kaliyugas
<div n="lb"/>make one Caturyuga. A Manu's period is completed
<div n="lb"/>at the end of 71 Caturyugas. With that, the first
<div n="lb"/>group of gods also comes to an end. At the end of four-
<div n="lb"/>teen such Manus, one “Kalpa” is over and a deluge
<div n="lb"/>takes place. The whole of this period comprises one
<div n="lb"/>night for Brahmā. Night is the time of complete inacti-
<div n="lb"/>vity. With the end of the night, creation is started
<div n="lb"/>again. When 360 such ahorātras of Brahmā are com-
<div n="lb"/>pleted, he completes one year. After completing 120
<div n="lb"/>such years, a Brahmā perishes. Again a period of abso-
<div n="lb"/>lute inactivity follows for the length of a Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>life-span. After a period of 120 Brahma varṣas (the life-
<div n="lb"/>span of a Brahmā) another Brahmā comes into being.
<div n="NI"/>The life-span of Brahmā is shown in the following
<div n="lb"/>tabular form:
<div n="lb"/>360 days for gods—One Deva vatsara.
<div n="lb"/>12,000 Deva vatsaras—1 caturyuga (36 lakhs years
<div n="lb"/>for human beings).
<div n="lb"/>71 caturyugas—1 Manvantaram (One
<div n="lb"/>Manu's life-span).
<div n="lb"/>14 Manvantaras—1 Kalpa (one day time for
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā)
<div n="lb"/>2 Kalpas—One day (and night) for
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. (Ahorātra)
<div n="lb"/>360 days of Brahmā—1 Brahma Varṣa
<div n="lb"/>120 Brahma Varṣas—One Brahmā's life-span.
<div n="NI"/>This life-span of one Brahmā is therefore 30 crores 9
<div n="lb"/>lakhs 17 thousands 376 hundreds of years of human
<div n="lb"/>beings.
<div n="NI"/>It is said that a Manu's period of reign is 4,32,000
<div n="lb"/>Manuṣyarvarṣas. (Bhāgavata, 3rd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The caturyuga scheme.%} A caturyuga consists of the
<div n="lb"/>four yugas, namely Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali
<div n="lb"/>yugas. At the end of each Caturyuga, the Vedas perish
<div n="lb"/>Then the “Saptarṣis” (seven sages) come down from
<div n="lb"/>heaven to the earth and restore them again. Manu
<div n="lb"/>who is the propounder of Dharma śāstra, is also born
[Page483-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in every Kṛtayuga. The Devas of each Manvantaram
<div n="lb"/>feed upon the share of Havis (offerings at sacrifices) of
<div n="lb"/>the yāga till the end of that Manvantara. During the
<div n="lb"/>whole period of the Manvantara, the earth is protected
<div n="lb"/>and preserved by the sons of Manu and their descen-
<div n="lb"/>dants. Thus Manu, the Saptarṣis, Devas, Indra and the
<div n="lb"/>Kings who are the sons of Manu are the authorities of
<div n="lb"/>the Manvantara. After 14 Manvantaras a Kalpa of
<div n="lb"/>about 1,000 yugas, comes to an end. After that there is
<div n="lb"/>a night extending over the same period in duration. At
<div n="lb"/>that time Mahāviṣṇu sleeps on his bed Ananta in the
<div n="lb"/>ocean of deluge. After that, he wakes up again and
<div n="lb"/>performs creation. Manus, Kings, Indra, Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Saptarṣis are the Sāttvika aspects of Mahāviṣṇu, who
<div n="lb"/>performs the work of protecting the world. In Kṛta
<div n="lb"/>yuga, Mahāviṣṇu assumes the form of Kapila and others
<div n="lb"/>and preaches “Paramajñāna”. In Tretā yuga he assumes
<div n="lb"/>the form of an emperor and destroys the wicked people.
<div n="lb"/>In Dvāpara yuga, he assumes the form of Vyāsa and
<div n="lb"/>after dividing the Veda into 4 sections, classifies each
<div n="lb"/>of the sections into the various branches. At the end
<div n="lb"/>of Kaliyuga, Mahāviṣṇu assumes the form of Kalki and
<div n="lb"/>restores the vicious to the path of righteousness. This is
<div n="lb"/>the “Caturyuga scheme” of Mahāviṣṇu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The fourteen Manus.%} The names of the fourteen
<div n="lb"/>Manus of one Kalpa are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(1) Svāyambhuva (2) Svārociṣa (3) Uttama (Auttami)
<div n="lb"/>(4) Tāmasa (5) Raivata (6) Cākṣuṣa (7) Vaivas-
<div n="lb"/>vata (8) Sāvarṇi (9) Dakṣasāvarṇi (10) Brahmasāvarṇi

<div n="lb"/>devasāvarṇi (14) Indrasāvarṇi.
<div n="NI"/>Each of the above Manus is described below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Svāyambhuva.%}
<div n="NI"/>(a) {%General.%} Svāyambhuva was born as the spiritual
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā. This Manu got his name because he
<div n="lb"/>was “Svāyambhuva” or born from Brahmā. He married
<div n="lb"/>the goddess Śatarūpā, the spiritual daughter of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>After that, he went to the shore of the ocean of milk,
<div n="lb"/>made an image of Mahādevī there and worshipped her
<div n="lb"/>by chanting Vāgbhava mantra and performed an aus-
<div n="lb"/>tere penance. After a hundred years of such worship the
<div n="lb"/>goddess was pleased. She appeared before Svāyambhuva
<div n="lb"/>and granted him boons. She blessed him to attain the
<div n="lb"/>highest place in Heaven (Paramapada) after begetting
<div n="lb"/>vast progeny. Then the goddess went to Vindhya moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain and became the deity of Vindhya. Svāyambhuva
<div n="lb"/>returned and started his reign by worshipping the
<div n="lb"/>goddess.
<div n="NI"/>This Svāyambhuva is regarded as the author of the
<div n="lb"/>famous work “Manusmṛti”. Kālidāsa says that the
<div n="lb"/>Kings of the Raghu dynasty lived in strict obedience
<div n="lb"/>to the laws laid down by this Manu. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Daśama Skandha).

<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 201).
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) Upamanyu saw Svāyambhuva Manu sitting by
<div n="lb"/>the side of Śiva. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 14,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 280).
<div n="NI"/>(xv) He talked with the sage Suparṇa about the great-

<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 45).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Svārociṣa.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%(a) General.%} Svāyambhuva had two great sons Priya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata and Uttānapāda. The second Manu was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Priyavrata and his name was Svārociṣa. He was a
<div n="lb"/>glorious and adventurous man. He went to the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the river Kālindī, made a hermitage there, installed
<div n="lb"/>an idol of Devī made of earth and offered worship most
<div n="lb"/>fervently. At the end of 12 years of tapas when he ate only

<div n="lb"/>brilliance and blessed him. The name of this Devī was
<div n="lb"/>“Dhāriṇīdevī”. After a reign of many years this King
<div n="lb"/>went to Heaven. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(b) {%Other Details.%}

<div n="lb"/>He went to Gaṅgā tīrtha and offered worship to Devī
<div n="lb"/>for three years with Vāgbīja mantra. At the end of it,
<div n="lb"/>Devī was pleased and blessed him with worthy sons and
<div n="lb"/>a kingdom without the threat of enemies After a happy
<div n="lb"/>reign of many years, at the close of the Manvantara, he
<div n="lb"/>reached the highest place in Heaven. Devi Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
[Page484-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(b) {%Other details.%} Suśānti was the name of the Devendra
<div n="lb"/>of this Manvantara. There were five groups of Devas,
<div n="lb"/>namely Sudhāmans, Satyas, Japas, Pratardanas and
<div n="lb"/>Śivas, each group consisting of twelve Devas. The seven
<div n="lb"/>sons of the sage Vasiṣṭha were the saptarṣis of this

<div n="lb"/>Ūrjjā were Rajas, Gotra, Ūrdhvabāhu, Savana, Anagha,
<div n="lb"/>Sutapas and Śukra. Aja, Paraśudīpta and others were
<div n="lb"/>the sons of the Manu Uttama. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I.
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Tāmasa.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%(a) General.%} The fourth Manu Tāmasa was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Priyavrata. That King performed penance to Devī on
<div n="lb"/>the northern bank of the river Narmadā with Kāmarāja
<div n="lb"/>mantra. As a result of Devī's blessing, he obtained a
<div n="lb"/>prosperous Kingdom and worthy sons. After a long
<div n="lb"/>reign he attained heaven. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) Other details.%} At the time of this Manu, there were
<div n="lb"/>four groups of Devas, namely—Supāras, Haris, Satyas,
<div n="lb"/>and Sudhīs. Each of these groups contained 27

<div n="lb"/>Jyotirmān, Pṛthu, Kāvya, Caitra, Agnivanaka, and
<div n="lb"/>Pīvara and Nara. Khyāti, Keturūpa, Jānujaṅgha and
<div n="lb"/>others were the sons of Tāmasa Manu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part I, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Raivata.%}
<div n="NI"/>(a) {%General.%} The fifth Manu Raivata was the younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of Tāmasa. He worshipped Devī with Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>bīja mantra on the banks of the river Kālindī. With the
<div n="lb"/>blessing of Devī he ruled for many years and then
<div n="lb"/>attained Heaven. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(b) {%Other details.%} The name of the Indra of this
<div n="lb"/>Manvantara was Vibhu. There were four groups of

<div n="lb"/>others were mighty Kings. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 3,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Cākṣuṣa.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%(a) General.%} This Manu was the son of Aṅga. Once
<div n="lb"/>he went to the Rājarṣi (royal saint) Pulaha and prayed
<div n="lb"/>for prosperity, mastery of the whole world, invincible
<div n="lb"/>power and profound scholarship. Pulaha sent him to
<div n="lb"/>Devī. The Rājarṣi taught him the worship of Devī.
<div n="lb"/>After acquiring the mantra Cākṣuṣa went to the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river Virajā and offered worship to Devī.
<div n="lb"/>At the end of twelve years, Devī appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and blessed him with “Manuhood”, mastery of the
<div n="lb"/>Manu kingdom and brilliant sons After many years
<div n="lb"/>he distributed his kingdoms among his sons and at last
<div n="lb"/>attained “Devīpada”. (Devī Bhāgavata, Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) The following account is given in Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part I, Chapter 13, about the birth of Cākṣuṣa Manu.
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva and his wife Śambhu had two sons, namely
<div n="lb"/>Śiṣṭi and Bhavya. Succhāyā, the wife of Śiṣṭi gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to five sons, Ripu, Ripuñjaya, Vipra, Vṛkala and
<div n="lb"/>Vṛkatejas, who were all sinless. Cākṣuṣa was born to
[Page484-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhatī, the wife of Ripu. Cākṣuṣa begot Manu by
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkariṇī, daughter of Vīraṇa Prajāpati. This was the
<div n="lb"/>sixth Manu. By his wife Naḍvalā, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Vairāja Prajāpati, he had 10 sons, namely, Kuru,
<div n="lb"/>Puru, Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satyavān, Śuci, Agni-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭoma, Atirātra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Āgneyī,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Kuru, gave birth to six sons who were Aṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Sumanas, Khyāti, Kratu, Aṅgiras and Śibi. Sunīthā,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Aṃga, gave birth to Vena. Pṛthu was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Vena. He is also known as “Vainya”.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The Indra of that period was Manojava. There
<div n="lb"/>were five groups of Devas—Ākhyas, Prasūtas, Bhavyas,
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthukas and Lekhas, each group consisting of eight

<div n="lb"/>Sumedhas, Virajas, Haviṣmān, Uttama, Madhu,
<div n="lb"/>Atināman and Sahiṣṇu. Śatadyumna and other mighty
<div n="lb"/>Kings were the sons of Cākṣuṣa Manu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part I, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The sons of this Manu became famous under the
<div n="lb"/>name “Variṣṭhas” (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>18, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Vaivasvata.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%(a) General.%} He was born from Sūrya. It is this Manu
<div n="lb"/>who rules the world today. All living beings that we
<div n="lb"/>see today were born from him. Vaivasvata Manu is
<div n="lb"/>Satyavrata Manu who escaped from the last deluge.
<div n="lb"/>To save him Viṣṇu took up the incarnation of Matsya
<div n="lb"/>(fish). Vaivasvata Manu was also the first of the Kings
<div n="lb"/>of the Sūrya vaṃśa (Solar Dynasty) who ruled over
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) Other details.%} (i) In Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, we see that the sons of Vaivasvata namely
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku, Nābhāga, Dhṛṣṭa, Śaryāti, Nariṣyanta,
<div n="lb"/>Prāṃśu, Nṛga, Diṣṭa, Karūṣa and Pṛṣadhra were also

<div n="NI"/>(ii) This Manu worshipped Devī and received her
<div n="lb"/>blessing and attained Heaven after a long reign. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Vaivasvata Manu had another name, “Śrāddha-
<div n="lb"/>deva.” The Devas of this Manvantaram are Ādityas,
<div n="lb"/>Vasus and Rudras. The name of the Indra of this
<div n="lb"/>period is Purandara. The Saptarṣis are, Vasiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, Atri, Jamadagni, Gautama, Viśvāmitra and
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja. The nine Dhārmikas (virtuous ones),
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku, Nṛga, Dhṛṣṭa, Śaryāti, Nariṣyanta, Nābhāga,
<div n="lb"/>Ariṣṭa, Karūṣa and Prṣadhra are the sons of Vaivas-
<div n="lb"/>vata Manu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 8, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Ten sons were born to this Manu who were Vena,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛṣṇu, Nariṣyanta, Nābhāga, Ikṣvāku, Kārūṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Śaryāti, Ilā, Pṛṣadhra, and Nābhāgāriṣṭa. (M.B. Ādi

<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Sāvarṇi.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%(a) General.%} Even in his previous birth he was a
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Devī. In his former birth (during the
<div n="lb"/>period of Svārociṣa Manvantara) Sāvarṇi was born as
<div n="lb"/>a King of Caitravaṃśa under the name Suratha. The
<div n="lb"/>origin of the dynasty known as Caitravaṃśa was as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—Atri, son of Brahmā had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Niśākara. This Niśākara became an emperor by
<div n="lb"/>performing Rājasūya. Emperor Niśākara had a son
<div n="lb"/>Budha and Budha had a son named Caitra, both of
<div n="lb"/>whom were greatly renowned. It was Caitra's family
<div n="lb"/>which later on became the reputed Caitra dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>The son of that Caitra was Viratha. Suratha was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Viratha. This was the previous birth of
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi Manu. Suratha was a great hero and poet.
<div n="lb"/>Once another King besieged his city and defeated him.
<div n="lb"/>Suratha left his kingdom and went alone on horseback
<div n="lb"/>and took shelter in a dense forest. While wandering
<div n="lb"/>in the forest like a mad man with a broken heart, he
<div n="lb"/>happened to reach the āśrama of the sage Sumedhas.
<div n="lb"/>The sage advised him to worship Devī in order to
<div n="lb"/>retrieve his lost kingdom and prosperity. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>the King worshipped Devī who was pleased and
<div n="lb"/>restored to him his kingdom and prosperity. Besides,
<div n="lb"/>she blessed him that in his next birth he would become
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi, the King of the Solar dynasty and would be
<div n="lb"/>revered as the eighth Manu. Thus the eighth Manu
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi will be the second birth of Suratha. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) Other details.%} Sāvarṇi is also the son of Sūrya.
<div n="lb"/>How he came to be called Sāvarṇi is explained below:—
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya had three children Manu, Yama and Yamī by
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā, the daughter of Viśvakarmā. This Manu was
<div n="lb"/>Vaivasvata Manu, the seventh Manu. Unable to bear
<div n="lb"/>the intense heat of Sūrya, Saṃjñā once sent her maid
<div n="lb"/>Chāyā to Sūrya in her own disguise and went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>for tapas. Sūrya had three children by Chāyā, Śanai-
<div n="lb"/>ścara, another Manu and Tapatī. This Manu is known as
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi who will become the eighth Manu. In his time
<div n="lb"/>there will be three groups of Devas—Sutapas, Amitā-
<div n="lb"/>bhas and Mukhyas. Each of these groups will consist of
<div n="lb"/>twelve persons. The Saptarṣis of the eighth Manvantara
<div n="lb"/>are Dīptimān, Gālava, Rāma, Kṛpa, Aśvatthāmā son
<div n="lb"/>of Droṇa, Vyāsa son of Parāśara and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali, son of Virocana will be the Indra. Virajas,
<div n="lb"/>Urvarīyān, Nirmoka and others are the Kings who are
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Sāvarṇi Manu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Dakṣa Sāvarṇi.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%General.%} At the time of this Manu there are three
<div n="lb"/>groups of Devas namely, Pāras, Marīcigarbhas and
<div n="lb"/>Sudharmans. Each of the groups contains 12 Devas.
<div n="lb"/>The Indra who is the king of those Devas, is the mighty
<div n="lb"/>Adbhuta. The Saptarṣis of this Manvantara are:—Savana,
<div n="lb"/>Dyutimān, Bhavya, Vasu, Medhātithi, Jyotiṣmān and
<div n="lb"/>Satya, Dhṛtaketu. Dīptiketu, Pañcahasta, Nirāmaya,
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthuśravas are the sons of Dakṣasāvarṇi Manu. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(10). {%Brahma Sāvarṇi.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%General.%} In this Manvantara, the Devas are Sudhā-
<div n="lb"/>mans and Viśuddhas. Each of these groups will contain
<div n="lb"/>100 Devas. Their Indra will be the heroic Śānti. The
<div n="lb"/>Saptarṣis will be Haviṣmān, Sukṛta, Satya, Tapomūrti,
<div n="lb"/>Nabhāga, Apratimaujas and Satyaketu. Brahma Sāvarṇi
<div n="lb"/>will have ten sons, three of whom are, Sukṣetra, Uttam-
[Page485-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>aujas and Bhūtisena who will become Kings. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(11). {%Dharma Sāvarṇi.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%General.%} In this Manvantara there will be three

<div n="lb"/>the earth will be Uru, Gambhīrabuddhi and others.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Some more details.%} Fourteen Manus have been
<div n="lb"/>mentioned above. Of them, the seventh Manu, Vaivas-
<div n="lb"/>vata Manu is the Head of the present Manvantrara.
<div n="lb"/>Some general facts about the Manus are given below:-
<div n="NI"/>1) The six Manus after the eighth one namely,
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣasāvarṇi, Merusāvarṇi, Sūryasāvarṇi, Candra-
<div n="lb"/>sāvarṇī, Rudrasāvarṇi and Viṣṇusāvarṇi are
<div n="lb"/>respectively the re-births of Karūṣa, Pṛṣadhra, Nābh-
<div n="lb"/>āga, Diṣṭa, Śaryāti and Triśaṅku who were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Vaivasvsata Manu. There is a story about their
<div n="lb"/>taking re-births. All the six persons mentioned above
<div n="lb"/>were once offering worship to the idol of Devī on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river Kālindī. After twelve years, Devī
<div n="lb"/>appeared, under the name of Bhramarāmbikā and blessed
<div n="lb"/>them that in their next births they would become
<div n="lb"/>rulers of Manvantaras. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) It is said that the four Manus, Svārociṣa, Uttama,
<div n="lb"/>Tāmasa and Raivata belonged to Priyavrata's family.
<div n="lb"/>It was because Priyavrata who was a Rājarṣi offered
<div n="lb"/>tapas to Viṣṇu that four Manus were born in his family.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa. Part III, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>3) It is the power of Viṣṇu that dominates all the
<div n="lb"/>Manvantaras as the basic divinity. In the first Svāyam-
<div n="lb"/>bhuva Manvantara it was a part of that power of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>itself that originated as Yajñapuruṣa in Ābhūti. After
<div n="lb"/>that when Svārociṣa Manvantara came it was again that
<div n="lb"/>divinity that took its origin in Tuṣitā as Ajita among the
[Page486-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣitas. In Uttama Manvantara that divinity Tuṣita him
<div n="lb"/>self was born again under the name of Satya as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Satyā in the group of Devas called Satyas. When Tāmasa
<div n="lb"/>Manvantara began, that divinity was born again as the
<div n="lb"/>son of Haryā as a Hari in the group of Devas called
<div n="lb"/>Haris. It was that divinity Hari himself who was born
<div n="lb"/>in Sambhūti under the name of Mānasa among the
<div n="lb"/>Devas called Raivatas in Raivata Manvantara. In Cākṣuṣa
<div n="lb"/>Manvantara that Viṣṇu Bhagavān took birth in Vikuṇṭhī
<div n="lb"/>as one of the Vaikuṇṭhas. In the present Vaivasvata
<div n="lb"/>Manvantara, Viṣṇu has incarnated in Aditi as Vāmana,
<div n="lb"/>the son of Kaśyapa. That great Vāmana conquered
<div n="lb"/>all the three worlds and presented them to Devendra.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>Besides the fourteen Manus mentioned above, certain
<div n="lb"/>other Manus are also referred to in the Purāṇas. Some
<div n="lb"/>details about them are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) It is seen from Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>14th Sarga, verse 11, that Kaśyapa had a wife named
<div n="lb"/>Manu.
<div n="NI"/>(2) There is a reference to a Rājarṣi (Saintly king)
<div n="lb"/>named Manu in Ṛgveda, first Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka,
<div n="lb"/>112th Sūkta.
<div n="NI"/>(3) A son named Manu was born to the Agni Tapa or
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcajanya. This Manu has another name Bhānu. He
<div n="lb"/>had three wives named Suprajā, Bṛhadbhāsā and Niśā.
<div n="lb"/>Six sons were born to him by the first two wives. By
<div n="lb"/>his third wife he had one daughter and seven sons.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 221, Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(4) In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 57, verse 43,
<div n="lb"/>we find a reference to another Manu named Pracetas.
