RĀMĀYAṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Rāmāyaṇa is considered to be the first
<div n="lb"/>poetic composition in the world or at least in India,
<div n="lb"/>and hence it is called the Ādi Kāvya (First Epic). It
<div n="lb"/>is an epic as it contains descriptions and references to
<div n="lb"/>ancient themes. Vālmīki is its author, and hence
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki is known as the ‘Ādi kavi” also. Vālmīki and
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma were contemporaries. During his life in exile
<div n="lb"/>in the forest Rāma visited Vālmīkī's āśrama. It was
<div n="lb"/>in this āśrama that Sītā lived after being abandoned
<div n="lb"/>by Rāma. The connection in many ways of the life of
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki with the ‘Rāma story’ was an incentive for
<div n="lb"/>him to write the Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Composing of Rāmāyaṇa.%} Once while returning from
<div n="lb"/>the river Tamasā Vālmīki witnessed a hunter shooting
<div n="lb"/>down one of a Krauñca (a kind of bird) couple. The
<div n="lb"/>intense emotion created by the incident burst out as
<div n="lb"/>follows in verse form.
<Poem>Mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhāṃ tvamagamaḥ
<div n="lb"/>śāśvatīḥ samāḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Yat krauñcamithunādekamavadhīḥ
<div n="lb"/>kāmamohitam. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Immediately Brahmā appeared on the scene and
<div n="lb"/>advised Vālmīki to write the story of Rāma in the
<div n="lb"/>same pattern as that verse. Brahmā taught him about
<div n="lb"/>the past and the future of the history of Rāma. As
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, Kuśa, and Lava were living in his āśrama Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>was well in the know about the present. In the above
[Page641-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>background Vālmīki completed writing the Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Story in 24,000 verses. The epic is divided into seven
<div n="lb"/>kāṇḍas (sections) of five hundred chapters. The seven
<div n="lb"/>sections are the Bālakāṇḍa, the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, the
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya kāṇḍa, the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, the Sundara
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, the Yuddha Kāṇḍa and the Uttarakāṇḍa.
<div n="NI"/>Vālmīki taught the poem to Lava and Kuśa and when
<div n="lb"/>they went with Vālmīki to Ayodhyā during the
<div n="lb"/>aśvamedhayajña of Śrī Rāma, they sang the poem in
<div n="lb"/>the open assembly there.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Different views about the author.%} Tradition ascribes
<div n="lb"/>the authorship of the Rāmāyaṇa to Vālmīki. But,
<div n="lb"/>western scholars hold the view that a part of Bālakāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>and the whole of Uttarakāṇḍa are interpolations of a
<div n="lb"/>future date. The following are the reasons for this view.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Two different texts are found for cantos one and
<div n="lb"/>three of Bālakāṇḍa. In one of them many of the stories
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the other are missing. It may, therefore,
<div n="lb"/>be surmised that the two texts were composed during
<div n="lb"/>different periods.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) In the early texts of Rāmāyaṇa stories like Gaṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>vataraṇam are not to be found. So they must be inter-
<div n="lb"/>polations of a later period.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Only in Kāṇḍas one and seven is Śrī Rāma treated
<div n="lb"/>as an incarnation. In the other Kāṇḍas he is considered
<div n="lb"/>in the capacity of a hero only.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Uttarakāṇḍa is not to be found among the early
<div n="lb"/>translations of Rāmāyaṇa into other languages.
<div n="NI"/>(v) In the Bālakāṇḍa it is stated that Vālmīki com-
<div n="lb"/>posed the Rāmāyaṇa, taught it to Kuśa and Lava, and
<div n="lb"/>that they recited the whole poem before Śrī Rāma at
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. Many of the things mentioned in this Kāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>are repeated in Uttarakāṇḍa, which, therefore, must
<div n="lb"/>have been written by someone else.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The period of Rāmāyaṇa.%} According to Indian belief
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma lived at the end of Tretāyuga, which came to
<div n="lb"/>its close in 8,67,100 B.C. As per Rāmāyaṇa Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>ruled the country for 11,000 years. He was forty years
<div n="lb"/>old when he ascended the throne. Vālmīki began
<div n="lb"/>writing the Rāmāyaṇa after Lavakuśas were born.
<div n="lb"/>In the light of the above facts. certain scholars opine
<div n="lb"/>that the Rāmāyaṇa was written near about 878000
<div n="lb"/>B.C. But, western critics and some eastern critics do
<div n="lb"/>not accept this view. Professor Jacobi holds the view
<div n="lb"/>that the original of Mahābhārata is anterior to
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa. Most scholars do not agree with this view.
<div n="lb"/>A great majority of critics are of opinion that Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>is anterior to Mahābhārata. They argue as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) The traditional belief in India is that Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was written much earlier than Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Rāmāyaṇa makes no reference to any of the
<div n="lb"/>characters of Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The Śrī Rāma story is referred to in many a
<div n="lb"/>Jātaka story of the Buddhists.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Vālmīki has made no mention about the city of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭalīputra established near about 380 B.C. It is an
<div n="lb"/>irrefutable fact that Śrī Rāma had passed by the city.
<div n="NI"/>(v) During the reign of emperor Aśoka the Prākṛta lan-
<div n="lb"/>guage was spoken in the areas where the incidents men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in Rāmāyaṇa took place. But, Rāmāyaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>written much anterior to the emergence of Prākṛta
<div n="lb"/>language.
<div n="NI"/>According to Professor Keith Rāmāyaṇa was written in
<div n="lb"/>300 B.C.

<div n="NI"/>5). {%Different readings of Rāmāyaṇa.%} In various parts of
<div n="lb"/>India three original texts or readings are found of the
<div n="lb"/>original Rāmāyaṇa. In each of the three texts nearly
<div n="lb"/>(1/3) of the portions differ from one another. The Bombay
<div n="lb"/>text is popular in northern and southern India. The
<div n="lb"/>second is the Bengal text. The third, the Kashmir text,
<div n="lb"/>is popular in the north-western parts of India. The in-
<div n="lb"/>ference to be made from the existence of these three
<div n="lb"/>different texts is that the original epic was composed in
<div n="lb"/>a Prākṛta language, which was most popular at the time
<div n="lb"/>and that it was later translated into Sanskrit by differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent persons at different times. This theory will
<div n="lb"/>explain the existence of the different texts. For many
<div n="lb"/>years it continued to be handed down from mouth to
<div n="lb"/>month till it assumed written form in Sanskrit.
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Other Rāmāyaṇas.%} The Rāmāyaṇa story in other
<div n="lb"/>forms and garbs, is also prevalent in India. One of
<div n="lb"/>them is Vāsiṣṭharāmāyaṇa or Jñānavāsiṣṭha. The
<div n="lb"/>authorship of it also is ascribed to Vālmīki. Most of
<div n="lb"/>the Rāmāyaṇas like Vāsiṣṭhottararāmāyaṇa, Sītāvijaya,
<div n="lb"/>Adbhutarāmāyaṇa, Adbhutottararāmāyaṇa etc. found
<div n="lb"/>in different parts of India are believed to have been
<div n="lb"/>written by Vālmīki. Adbhutarāmāyaṇa is composed of
<div n="lb"/>twenty-seven cantos. According to this Rāmāyaṇa, it
<div n="lb"/>was Sītā, who killed Rāvaṇa of ten heads. There is an-
<div n="lb"/>other Rāmāyaṇa in Sanskrit called Adhyātma-Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>It is a poem separated from Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa. It is
<div n="lb"/>written in the form of a conversation between Umā
<div n="lb"/>(Pārvatī) and Śiva. Ānanda-Rāmāyaṇa and Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa extol the greatness of Hanūmān.
