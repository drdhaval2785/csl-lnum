MAṆINĀGA II¦. A sacred place. If one spends a night
<div n="lb"/>here one would get the benefit of making a thousand
<div n="lb"/>Godānas. If one eats from the offerings made to a deity
<div n="lb"/>there one would be free from the effects of any snake-
<div n="lb"/>poison. (Śloka 106, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
