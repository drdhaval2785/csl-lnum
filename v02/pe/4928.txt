PĀKKANĀR¦. Vararuci, the celebrated astronomer, got
<div n="lb"/>of a Caṇḍālī wife twelve sons. They were called
<div n="lb"/>“Paracci peṭṭa pantīrkulam (The twelve sons born of
<div n="lb"/>a Caṇḍālī).
<div n="NI"/>They were
<div n="NI"/>1. Agnihotrī. 2. Rajakan 3. Uliyanūr Taccan. 4. Vallon
<div n="lb"/>5. Vāyillākkunnilappan. 6. Kārakkalmātā. 7. Vaṭutala
<div n="lb"/>Nāyar. 8. Uppukuṭṭan. 9. Pāṇanār. 10. Nārāyaṇa-
<div n="lb"/>bhrāntan 11. Akavūr Cāttan 12. Pākkanār.
<div n="NI"/>Pākkanār's wife was a very chaste woman devoted to
<div n="lb"/>her husband. There are two stories demonstrating the
<div n="lb"/>devotion she showed to her husband.
<div n="NI"/>(i) It was usual for all the sons of Vararuci excepting
<div n="lb"/>Vāyillākkunnilappan to assemble at the house of Agni-
<div n="lb"/>hotrī for the Śrāddha of their father annually once.
<div n="lb"/>Once after the Śrāddha, all of them sat together for
<div n="lb"/>their meals and the antarjanam (wife) of Agnihotrī
<div n="lb"/>refused to serve an assembly consisting of Pākkanār, a
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍāla. When Agnihotrī compelled her to do it she
<div n="lb"/>came to the place hiding her face with an umbrella.
<div n="lb"/>Pākkanār enquired about the purpose of the umbrella
<div n="lb"/>and Agnihotrī replied that it was the duty of chaste
<div n="lb"/>and devoted wives to hide their faces from other men.
<div n="lb"/>Then Pākkanār argued that still the brahmin wives who
<div n="lb"/>hid their faces were lacking in devotion and chastity
<div n="lb"/>and the Caṇḍāla women were the only class of women
<div n="lb"/>who were chaste and devoted to their husbands. Every-
<div n="lb"/>body present there joined sides with Agnihotrī and
<div n="lb"/>opposed the argument of Pākkanār. To demonstrate
<div n="lb"/>the devotion of Caṇḍālī wives Pākkanār took Agnihotrī
<div n="lb"/>to his house. On reaching there Pakkanār called his
<div n="lb"/>wife and asked “How much paddy do you have here?”
<div n="lb"/>“Five measures”, she replied. “Pound half of it and
<div n="lb"/>bring it to me”, Pākkanār instructed. The dutiful wife
<div n="lb"/>pounded the paddy, cooked the rice and brought it to
<div n="lb"/>Pākkanār. Pākkanār asked her to throw the rice into
<div n="lb"/>the drain. She did it without the least hesitation. Pākka
<div n="lb"/>nār then asked his wife to pound the remaining paddy
<div n="lb"/>and bring the rice cooked as before. She did so and when
<div n="lb"/>she brought it before Pākkanār he asked her to throw
<div n="lb"/>that also away into the drain. She instantly obeyed.
<div n="lb"/>That day both of them went without meals. They were
<div n="lb"/>so poor.
<div n="NI"/>The next day Pākkanār along with Agnihotrī went to
<div n="lb"/>the illam (house) of Agnihotrī. Pākkanār then asked
<div n="lb"/>Agnihotrī to make his wife do exactly like what
<div n="lb"/>Pākkanār's wife was made to do. Agnihotrī immediate-
<div n="lb"/>ly called his wife and asked her to take two and a half
<div n="lb"/>measures of paddy, pound it, cook it and bring it to
<div n="lb"/>him. “There is rice here ready in stock and so why
<div n="lb"/>should we pound paddy now?” Agnihotrī's wife
<div n="lb"/>questioned. But Agnihotrī insisted and so surrender-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the compulsion she did as she was instructed.
<div n="lb"/>When she brought the rice before him cooked, Agnihotrī
<div n="lb"/>asked her to throw it away into the drain. She hesitated
<div n="lb"/>first but when Agnihotrī insisted she did so very
<div n="lb"/>reluctantly. Then Agnihotrī asked her to take another
<div n="lb"/>two and a half measures of paddy, pound it and bring
<div n="lb"/>the cooked rice once again. The antarjanam (wife)
<div n="lb"/>flew into fury and showered on her husband a heap of
<div n="lb"/>abuses. She went and hid inside and despite repeated
<div n="lb"/>requests from Agnihotrī she never showed her face out
<div n="lb"/>again. Agnihotrī admitted defeat and accepted
<div n="lb"/>Pākkanār's view that a Caṇḍālī woman was more chaste
<div n="lb"/>than a brahmin woman.
[Page546-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once Agnihotrī came to the hut of Pākkanār.
<div n="lb"/>Pākkanār called his wife to bring a ‘palaka’ (a wooden
<div n="lb"/>plank used for sitting) for Agnihotrī to sit on. She was
<div n="lb"/>at that time drawing water from a well and the bucket
<div n="lb"/>was midway in the well with water. The instant she
<div n="lb"/>heard her husband call her she left the grip on the rope
<div n="lb"/>and rushed to the side of her husband. She did what
<div n="lb"/>was asked of her to do and then returned to the well.
<div n="lb"/>Pākkanār followed her taking Agnihotrī along with
<div n="lb"/>him. When they reached the well Agnihotrī was dumb-
<div n="lb"/>founded. The bucket with water was staying in mid-air
<div n="lb"/>in the well exactly at the position at which Pākkanār's
<div n="lb"/>wife had left it. The power of the chastity of the
<div n="lb"/>woman. (See under Vararuci).
