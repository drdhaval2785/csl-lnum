KINDAMA¦. A great sage. Once sage Kindama and
<div n="lb"/>his wife were roaming in the forest in the form of deer.
<div n="lb"/>While hunting, King Pāṇḍu discharged his arrow
<div n="lb"/>against the he-deer. It assumed its original form as
<div n="lb"/>sage Kindama and told the King that it was wrong on
<div n="lb"/>his part to have hit him (the sage) while he was
<div n="lb"/>engaged in love play. “I am dying, but in future if
<div n="lb"/>you physically contact your wife you too will die.” After
<div n="lb"/>saying so the sage fell down dead. Pāṇḍu could never
<div n="lb"/>have children of his own from his wives due to this
<div n="lb"/>curse. He forgot all about the curse once, embraced
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī and fell down dead. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 117).
