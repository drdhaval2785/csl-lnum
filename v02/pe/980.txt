BHADRAMATI¦. A very poor brahmin. This brahmin
<div n="lb"/>had six wives and two hundred and forty-four daughters.
<div n="lb"/>(Nārada Purāṇam).
<div n="NI"/>Once, hearing the glory of Bhūdāna (giving away land
<div n="lb"/>free to the deserved) he was much impressed and from
<div n="lb"/>then onwards he became filled with a strong desire
<div n="lb"/>to give land free to the poor. He had no land of his
<div n="lb"/>own. But he went to the king of Kauśāmbī and begged
<div n="lb"/>for some land which when received was immediately
<div n="lb"/>given as gift to poor brahmins. After that he went and
<div n="lb"/>bathed in the Pāpanāśana tīrtha situated in the mount
<div n="lb"/>of Veṅkaṭācala. Bhadramati got salvation by this good
<div n="lb"/>deed. (Skanda 2,1,10).
