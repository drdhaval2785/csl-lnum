PĀṬALĪPUTRA¦. An ancient city of Purāṇic fame in
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Bhārata. The former name of this city was
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭalīputraka. There is a story behind the city getting
<div n="lb"/>this name:—
<div n="NI"/>There was once a sacred pond named Kanakhala on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of river Gaṅgā. A brahmin from Dakṣiṇa-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata along with his wife came to this pond and
<div n="lb"/>started practising severe austerities there. He got three
<div n="lb"/>sons while living there. After some time the parents
<div n="lb"/>died. The three sons went to a place named Rājagṛha
<div n="lb"/>and studied there. The three were very poor and they
<div n="lb"/>went from there to perform penance to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya (Kumārasvāmī). On their way they
<div n="lb"/>entered the house of a brahmin named Bhojika living
<div n="lb"/>on the sea-coast. Bhojika had three daughters and the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin after knowing all details about them gave his
<div n="lb"/>daughters in marriage to them along with all his wealth.
<div n="lb"/>The brahmin went to perform penance and the three
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boys with their wives lived in that house.
<div n="NI"/>Once there occurred a famine and the three brahmins
<div n="lb"/>left their home leaving their wives alone. The second
<div n="lb"/>girl was pregnant at that time and she and her sisters
<div n="lb"/>went to the house of a friend of their father named
<div n="lb"/>Yajñadatta. In due course she delivered a son and all
[Page583-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the three women looked after the child as their common
<div n="lb"/>son.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva and Pārvatī were travelling by air once and seeing
<div n="lb"/>this child Śiva said thus:—“I am blessing this boy.
<div n="lb"/>This boy in his previous birth jointly with his wife
<div n="lb"/>worshipped me with great devotion. They are now born
<div n="lb"/>again to enjoy life. His wife in his previous birth was
<div n="lb"/>born as the daughter of King Mahendra. Her name
<div n="lb"/>was Pāṭalī and she would again be the wife of this boy
<div n="lb"/>in this life.”
<div n="NI"/>That night Paramaśiva appeared before the mother of
<div n="lb"/>the boy in a dream and said “You must name this boy
<div n="lb"/>Putraka. Everyday morning when he rises up a lakh of
<div n="lb"/>small gold coins will fall to the ground from his
<div n="lb"/>head.”
<div n="NI"/>They therefore, named the boy Putraka and every
<div n="lb"/>morning they would collect and store the gold coins
<div n="lb"/>falling from his head. When Putraka grew up he was
<div n="lb"/>immensely rich and started giving away his riches to
<div n="lb"/>brahmins as gifts. The news of this spread far and wide
<div n="lb"/>and brahmins from all sides began to flock to his
<div n="lb"/>house.
<div n="NI"/>One day among the brahmins who flocked to his house
<div n="lb"/>were his father and his two brothers. The fathers felt
<div n="lb"/>envious of the extraordinary progress in wealth and
<div n="lb"/>fame of their son and they cleverly took the son to a
<div n="lb"/>lonely place in a temple in the heart of the Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>mountains to kill him. After engaging some murderers
<div n="lb"/>to kill him they left the place. Putraka bribed
<div n="lb"/>the murderers with his costly dresses and ornaments
<div n="lb"/>and escaped from there. There was a great storm then
<div n="lb"/>and Putraka walked through it. On his way he met the
<div n="lb"/>two sons of Mayāsura quarrelling for the three things
<div n="lb"/>left over to them by their father. The paternal property
<div n="lb"/>consisted of a stick, a pair of sandals and a pot all
<div n="lb"/>of which had some strange powers. If you draw on
<div n="lb"/>the ground with the stick you will have at that spot
<div n="lb"/>anything you desire. If you wear the sandals you can
<div n="lb"/>travel in the air. If you dip your hands into the pot
<div n="lb"/>you will get plenty of food.
<div n="NI"/>Putraka immediately hit upon a plan and addressed the
<div n="lb"/>quarrelling brothers thus:—“Why do you fight like
<div n="lb"/>this? It is better you decide it by a competitive race.
<div n="lb"/>He who wins the race should have the right to get the
<div n="lb"/>things.” The two brothers agreed to it and leaving the
<div n="lb"/>things with Putraka started running. When they had
<div n="lb"/>gone a long distance away from the spot, Putraka put
<div n="lb"/>on the sandals and taking the stick and pot with him
<div n="lb"/>rose into the air. He landed at a city far away from
<div n="lb"/>the spot and started living at the house of an old
<div n="lb"/>woman. The King of that country had a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭalī. When the old lady described to him the beauty
<div n="lb"/>and good qualities of Pāṭalī, Putraka wanted to marry
<div n="lb"/>her. So at night when everybody in the palace was
<div n="lb"/>asleep Putraka put on his sandals and entered the room
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṭalī through the windows. Pāṭali woke up; she
<div n="lb"/>liked Putraka and they were married according to
<div n="lb"/>Gāndharva rites. Then they both went out of the
<div n="lb"/>palace by air with the help of the sandals and landed
<div n="lb"/>at a place on the shores of the Gaṅgā. Then at the
<div n="lb"/>request of Pāṭalī Putraka made a city there with the
<div n="lb"/>help of the stick and they named it Pāṭalīputraka.
