{#nu#} 1¦. {%nu,%} ind. (perhaps related to 1. {%nava;%}
<div n="lb"/>cf. {%nūtana%}), written {%nū%} in Ved. at the beginning of
<div n="lb"/>a verse and frequently in other places. (As an adverb
<div n="lb"/>of time in Ved.), now, still (e. g. {%nū-ca purā-ca,%}
<div n="lb"/>both now and heretofore; {%asti svin nu vīryaṃ tat%}
<div n="lb"/>{%-te,%} hast thou still that power?). (As an inferential
<div n="lb"/>particle in Ved. often beginning the last sentence of
<div n="lb"/>a hymn), now therefore, now then, therefore, then
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%nū no rāsva,%} do thou therefore give us):
<div n="lb"/>(as an introductory particle, or in encouraging, in-
<div n="lb"/>voking, inviting, summoning), now, then, pray,
<div n="lb"/>come then (e. g. {%abhi nu mā cakṣamīthāḥ,%} pray
<div n="lb"/>now [Sāy. quickly] have compassion upon me).
<div n="lb"/>{%Nu%} is often employed in questions, both in Vedic and
<div n="lb"/>classical Sanskrit, to strengthen an interrogative pro-
[Page0514-b+ 78]
<div n="lb"/>noun or adverb (e. g. {%kadā nu,%} when indeed?
<div n="lb"/>{%kathaṃ nu,%} how indeed? {%kva nu,%} where indeed?
<div n="lb"/>{%kaṃ nu pṛcchāmi,%} whom can I possibly ask?
<div n="lb"/>{%kiṃ nu syāt,%} what can that possibly be? {%kiṃ nu%}
<div n="lb"/>{%khalu,%} why in the world?). {%Nu%} is also used inter-
<div n="lb"/>rogatively in classical Sanskrit, without an interro-
<div n="lb"/>gative pronoun, in sentences of two or more clauses
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%svapno nu māyā nu mati-bhramo nu,%} was
<div n="lb"/>it a dream? or an illusion of magic? or a mental
<div n="lb"/>delusion?). {%Nu%} also serves as a particle of affirma-
<div n="lb"/>tion, to express ‘indeed,’ ‘certainly,’ ‘surely’ (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%ahaṃ nu akārṣam,%} Yes, I certainly did so), and
<div n="lb"/>often gives emphasis to the word it follows without
<div n="lb"/>being itself translateable, in which way it is frequently
<div n="lb"/>connected in the Veda with other particles (e. g. with
<div n="lb"/>{%cid%} in {%cin nu;%} with {%id%} in {%in nu;%} with {%adha%} in
<div n="lb"/>{%adha nu;%} with {%gha%} in {%ghā nu,%} &c.); but in the
<div n="lb"/>Veda {%nu%} sometimes means ‘never’ (especially in
<div n="lb"/>the construction {%nū cit%} = never, nevermore; in other
<div n="lb"/>passages it is said to = ‘from this time forward,’ ‘for
<div n="lb"/>ever’). In classical Sanskrit {%nu%} is sometimes found
<div n="lb"/>in connection with {%vā,%} ‘or;’ and in Rāmāyaṇa II.
<div n="lb"/>72, 27, {%nu — nu%} may be translated ‘either’ — ‘or.’
<div n="lb"/>According to native commentators on the Veda {%nu%}
<div n="lb"/>often {%= kṣipram,%} quickly. According to native
<div n="lb"/>lexicographers {%nu%} is used in the following senses:
<div n="lb"/>{%pṛcchā, vikalpa, vitarka, anunaya, atīta, apa-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%māna, hetu, apadeśa;%} [cf. {%nū-nam, nū-tana;%}
<div n="lb"/>Zend {%nū,%} ‘just now;’ Gr. <lang n="greek">νύ, νῡ-νί, νῦν;</lang> Lat. <nsi>num,</nsi>
<div n="lb"/><nsi>nun-c;</nsi> Goth. <nsi>nu-h;</nsi> Old Germ. <nsi>nu;</nsi> Slav. <nsi>nyne,</nsi>
<div n="lb"/>‘at present.’]
