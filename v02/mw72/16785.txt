{#Kalu#}¦ {%khalu,%} ind. (as a particle of assevera-
<div n="lb"/>tion or affirmation), indeed, verily, certainly, truly,
<div n="lb"/>yes; (as a continuative particle), now, now then, now
<div n="lb"/>further; (as a particle employed in syllogistic forms
<div n="lb"/>of speech), but now, = the Latin <nsi>atqui.</nsi> It occurs
<div n="lb"/>only once in the Ṛg-veda; oftener in the Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>and Buddhist compositions, especially when combined
<div n="lb"/>with other particles, thus {%atha khalu, u khalu,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vai khalu,%} and {%khalu vai,%} = now then, now further.
<div n="lb"/>In later Sanskrit {%khalu%} frequently does little more
<div n="lb"/>than lay stress on the word by which it is preceded,
<div n="lb"/>and is sometimes merely an expletive. According
<div n="lb"/>to native lexicographers {%khalu%} is also a particle of
<div n="lb"/>prohibition, endearment, conciliation, and inquiry.
<div n="lb"/>{%Na khalu,%} by no means, not at all, indeed not.
