{#u#} 3¦. {%u,%} ind. an enclitic copula, used fre-
<div n="lb"/>quently in the Vedas; (as a particle implying re-
<div n="lb"/>striction and antithesis, generally after pronominals,
<div n="lb"/>prepositions, particles, and before {%nu%} and {%su,%} equiva-
<div n="lb"/>lent to) and, also, further; on the other hand (espe-
<div n="lb"/>cially in connection with a relative, e. g. {%ya u,%} he on
<div n="lb"/>the contrary who &c.).
<div n="P"/>This particle may serve to give emphasis, like {%id%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%eva,%} especially after prepositions or demonstrative
<div n="lb"/>pronouns, in conjunction with {%nu, vai, hi, cid,%} &c.
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%ayam u vām purutamo johavīmi,%} I this very
<div n="lb"/>person invoke you constantly). It is especially used in
<div n="lb"/>the figure of speech called Anaphora, and particularly
<div n="lb"/>when the pronouns are repeated (e. g. {%tam u stuṣa%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Indram tam gṛṇīṣe,%} him I praise, Indra, him
<div n="lb"/>I sing). It may be used in drawing a conclusion, like
<div n="lb"/>the English ‘now’ (e. g. {%tad u tathā na kuryāt,%}
<div n="lb"/>that now he should not do in such a manner), and
<div n="lb"/>is frequently found in interrogative sentences (e. g. {%ka%}
<div n="lb"/>{%u tac ciketa,%} who, I ask, should know that ?).
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini calls this particle {%uñ%} to distinguish it from
<div n="lb"/>the interrogative {%u.%} In the Pada-pāṭha it is written
<div n="lb"/>{%ūṃ.%}
<div n="P"/>In the classical language {%u%} occurs only after {%atha,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%na,%} and {%kim,%} with a slight modification of the sense,
<div n="lb"/>and often only as an expletive (see {%kim%}); {%u-u%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%u-uta,%} on the one hand — on the other hand; partly — 
<div n="lb"/>partly; as well — as.
