<div n="lb"/>cause eclipses, (according to the common myth
<div n="lb"/>he was a son of Vipra-citti and Sinhikā, and had
<div n="lb"/>four arms, his lower part ending in a tail; he was the

<div n="lb"/>when the gods had produced the Amṛta or nectar
<div n="lb"/>from the churned ocean, he disguised himself like
<div n="lb"/>one of them and drank a portion of it, but the Sun
<div n="lb"/>and Moon having detected his fraud and informed
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, the latter severed his head and two of his
<div n="lb"/>arms from the rest of his body; the portion of nectar
<div n="lb"/>he had swallowed having secured his immortality,
<div n="lb"/>the head and tail were transferred to the stellar
<div n="lb"/>sphere, the head wreaking its vengeance on the Sun
<div n="lb"/>and Moon by occasionally swallowing them for a

<div n="lb"/>meteors: in astronomy Rāhu is variously regarded
<div n="lb"/>as a dragon's head, as the ascending node of the
