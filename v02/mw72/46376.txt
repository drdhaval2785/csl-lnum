{%Śākha, as,%}¦ m. (said to be fr. rt. {%śākh,%} but accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to others fr. rt. 1. {%śak%}), a particular plant ({%= chitti%});
<div n="lb"/>N. of Kumāra or Kārttikeya; of a son of Kumāra;
<div n="lb"/>of a place; ({%ā%}), f. the branch of a tree &c., a branch
<div n="lb"/>(in general); any part or division of an animal; an
<div n="lb"/>arm; a finger (Ved., the fingers being compared to
<div n="lb"/>branches); a sect, faction, party; a subdivision, sec-
<div n="lb"/>tion (of any work); a branch or school or traditional
<div n="lb"/>recension of the Vedas, (i. e. the Saṃhitā or collection
<div n="lb"/>of Mantras and the Brāhmaṇas in each Veda as re-
<div n="lb"/>ceived in conflicting schools, modified more or less
<div n="lb"/>both in variations of the actual text and in difference
<div n="lb"/>of arrangement, and even of interpretation; the
<div n="lb"/>work {%śākhā%} or branch is sometimes used to dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinguish the three original Vedas from each other,
<div n="lb"/>as when it is said that ‘Sāma hymns ought not to
<div n="lb"/>be recited in the neighbourhood of another Śākhā,’
<div n="lb"/>i. e. of the other two Vedas; but it properly
<div n="lb"/>applies to the various recensions or editions of any
<div n="lb"/>of the original Vedas handed down by different
<div n="lb"/>Caraṇas, i. e. by different schools or sects, each ad-
<div n="lb"/>hering to its own traditional text and interpretation:
<div n="lb"/>in the Caraṇa-vyūha, a work by Śaunaka treating of
<div n="lb"/>these various schools, five Śākhās are enumerated of
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛg-veda, viz. those of the Śākalas, Bāṣkalas,
<div n="lb"/>Āśvalāyanas, Śānkhāyanas, and Māṇḍukāyanas; forty-
<div n="lb"/>two or forty-four out of eighty-six are mentioned of
<div n="lb"/>the Yajur-veda, fifteen of which belong to the Vāja-
<div n="lb"/>saneyins, including those of the Kāṇvas and Mādh-
<div n="lb"/>yandinas; twelve out of a thousand said to have once
<div n="lb"/>existed of the Sāma-veda and nine of the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda; of all these, however, the Ṛg-veda is said to
<div n="lb"/>be now extant in one only, viz. the Śākala-śākhā,
<div n="lb"/>the Yajur-veda in three and partially in four, the
<div n="lb"/>Sāma-veda in one or perhaps two, and the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda in one: although the words {%caraṇa%} and {%śākhā%}
<div n="lb"/>are sometimes used synonymously, yet {%caraṇa%} pro-
<div n="lb"/>perly applies to the sect or collection of persons united
<div n="lb"/>in one school, and {%śākhā%} to the traditional text
<div n="lb"/>followed, as in the phrase {%śākhām adhīte,%} he reads
<div n="lb"/>a particular recension of the Veda); any part of an
