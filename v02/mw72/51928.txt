<div n="lb"/>{%—Sāma-veda, as,%} m., N. of one of the three prin-

<div n="lb"/>sacred Mantras which constitute this Veda, (although
<div n="lb"/>the word {%sāman%} is thought to be connected with rt.
<div n="lb"/>{%śam,%} and {%soma%} is fr. another rt. [3. {%su%}], yet there
<div n="lb"/>is a clear connection between this Veda and the
<div n="lb"/>Soma ritual or moon-plant ceremonies; the princi-
<div n="lb"/>pal part of its Mantras being specially arranged for
<div n="lb"/>chanting by the Udgātṛ priests at such ceremonies,
<div n="lb"/>[e. g. the Jyotiṣṭoma and its various stages of
<div n="lb"/>Agniṣṭoma, Ukthya, &c.]; nevertheless it is really
<div n="lb"/>a mere reproduction of parts of the Ṛg-veda trans-
<div n="lb"/>posed and scattered about piecemeal, only 78 verses
<div n="lb"/>in the whole Sāma-veda being, it is said, untraceable
<div n="lb"/>to the present recension of the Ṛk: the Saṃhitā of
<div n="lb"/>the Sāma-veda consists of two parts; the first, called
<div n="lb"/>Ārcika [or Pūrvārcika or Chando-grantha], contains
<div n="lb"/>585 verses disjoined from their proper sequence in
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛg-veda and arranged in 59 Daśatis or decades,
<div n="lb"/>which again are subdivided into Prapāṭhakas and
<div n="lb"/>Ardha-prapāṭhakas; the second, called Staubhika [or
<div n="lb"/>Uttarārcika or Uttarā-grantha], contains 1225 verses,
<div n="lb"/>also chiefly from the Ṛk-saṃhitā, but less disjointed
<div n="lb"/>than in the first part, and arranged in nine Prapāṭhakas
<div n="lb"/>with Ardha-prapāṭhakas, mostly, however, grouped
<div n="lb"/>in triplets, the first verse of which is also in the
[Page1107-c+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>Ārcika, and thus appears twice in the Saṃhitā; this
<div n="lb"/>verse is called the Yoni or womb, being, as it were,
<div n="lb"/>a kind of parent of the two following verses, called
<div n="lb"/>Uttarā, which are required to adapt themselves to
<div n="lb"/>all the modulations and modifications observed in
<div n="lb"/>the intoning of this leading verse; directions for
<div n="lb"/>these modulations being carefully laid down in the
<div n="lb"/>Gānas or manuals for chanting, two of which, viz.
<div n="lb"/>the Veya-gāna and Āraṇya-gāna, are a directory for
<div n="lb"/>the Ārcika portion, and two, viz. the Ūha-gāna and
<div n="lb"/>Ūhya-gāna, for the Staubhika, the supposed efficacy
<div n="lb"/>of the hymns depending greatly on the right appli-
<div n="lb"/>cation of these directions for their utterance; it has
<div n="lb"/>been calculated that out of the aggregate of 1549
<div n="lb"/>distinct verses remaining in the two divisions of the
<div n="lb"/>Sāma-veda Saṃhitā after subtracting the repeated
<div n="lb"/>verses, 190 are from the 1st Maṇḍala of the Ṛk,
<div n="lb"/>9 from the 2nd, 40 from the 3rd, 23 from the 4th,
<div n="lb"/>53 from the 5th, 77 from the 6th, 75 from the 7th,
<div n="lb"/>355 from the 8th, 9 from the Vālakhilyas, 545
<div n="lb"/>from the 9th, 95 from the 10th; there being also
<div n="lb"/>12 verses from the Atharva-veda, and 4 from the
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā or white Yajur-veda; it will be
<div n="lb"/>observed that more verses are taken from the ninth
<div n="lb"/>than from any other Maṇḍala of the Ṛk, the whole
<div n="lb"/>of the 114 hymns of this ninth Maṇḍala being
<div n="lb"/>especially devoted to the praise of the Soma plant,
<div n="lb"/>and thence called Pāvamānyaḥ or ‘purificational,’
<div n="lb"/>this plant being there not only personified as a
<div n="lb"/>deity but described as primeval, immortal, all-pervad-
<div n="lb"/>ing, all-powerful, lord of gods, and indeed the Su-
<div n="lb"/>preme Being himself; it is remarkable that although
<div n="lb"/>in Manu I. 23. the Sāma-veda is described as drawn
<div n="lb"/>forth from the sun, yet in IV. 123, 124. its sound
<div n="lb"/>is said to possess a kind of impurity, which, however,
<div n="lb"/>Kullūka explains to be merely a semblance of im-
<div n="lb"/>purity, the reason given for this defect being that
<div n="lb"/>whereas the Ṛg-veda has the gods for its objects
<div n="lb"/>and the Yajur-has men, the Sāma- has special refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence to the Pitṛs or deceased ancestors [this relation-
<div n="lb"/>ship implying, perhaps, a connection between the
<div n="lb"/>Soma plant and the moon, as this plant was collected
<div n="lb"/>by moonlight, and in the later mythology was
<div n="lb"/>sometimes identified with the moon, the supposed
<div n="lb"/>residence of the Pitṛs]; this Veda is said to possess
<div n="lb"/>eight Brāhmaṇas, viz. the Prauḍha or large Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa [= Pañca-viṃśa], the Ṣaḍviṃśa, the Sāma-
<div n="lb"/>vidhi or Sāma-vidhāna, the Ārṣeya, the Devatā-
<div n="lb"/>dhyāya, the Vaṃśa, the Saṃhitopaniṣad, and the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad [<nsi>sic</nsi>], which last is probably the same as
<div n="lb"/>the Chāndogyopaniṣad of the Sāma-veda regarded
<div n="lb"/>as a Brāhmaṇa, see {%chandoga-brāhmaṇa, brāh-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%maṇa.%}) {%—Sāmaveda-cchalā,%} f., N. of a short work
<div n="lb"/>(giving certain musical directions in the form of
<div n="lb"/>modulations and intonations of letters or syllables for

<div n="lb"/>seven chapters, viz. {%veya-cchalā, āraṇā-c°, ūha-c°,%}
