<div n="lb"/>gen. c. of {%śvan%}), ‘dog-tailed,’ N. of a Vedic Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>(having the patronymic Ājigarti, as son of Ajigarta
<div n="lb"/>or Ajīgarta, and regarded as the author of the hymns
<div n="lb"/>Ṛg-veda I. 24-30, IX. 3; according to a legend
<div n="lb"/>told in the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa VII. 13-18, king
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra, whose priest was Viśvā-mitra, being
<div n="lb"/>childless, made a vow that on obtaining a son he
<div n="lb"/>would sacrifice him to the god Varuṇa; a son was
<div n="lb"/>then born to him named Rohita, but Hariścandra
<div n="lb"/>put off on various pretexts the fulfilment of his vow,
<div n="lb"/>and when he at length consented to perform it, his
<div n="lb"/>son declined being sacrificed, and retiring to the
<div n="lb"/>forest passed six years there until he met a poor
<div n="lb"/>Brāhman Ṛṣi named Ajīgarta, who had three sons,
<div n="lb"/>the second of whom, Śunaḥ-śepha, was purchased by
<div n="lb"/>Rohita for a hundred cows to serve as a substitute
<div n="lb"/>for himself; Varuṇa having accepted him as a ransom,
<div n="lb"/>he was about to be sacrificed, Viśvā-mitra being Hotṛ
<div n="lb"/>priest, when he saved himself by reciting verses in
<div n="lb"/>praise of various deities, and was received into the
<div n="lb"/>family of Viśvā-mitra as one of his sons under the
<div n="lb"/>name of Deva-rāta, q. v.: the legend is different in
<div n="lb"/>the Rāmāyaṇa, which makes Ambarīṣa, king of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā, perform a sacrifice, the victim of which is
<div n="lb"/>stolen by Indra; this king is described as wandering
<div n="lb"/>over the earth in search of either the real victim or
<div n="lb"/>a substitute until he meets with a Brāhman named
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka, from whom he purchases his middle son,
<div n="lb"/>Śunaḥ-śepha, who is about to be sacrificed, when
<div n="lb"/>Viśvā-mitra saves him by teaching him a prayer to
<div n="lb"/>Agni and two hymns to Indra and Viṣṇu; see
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa I. 61, 62); ({%am%}), n. the genital organ
<div n="lb"/>of a dog.
