{%Mārkaṇḍeya, as,%}¦ m. a patronymic from Mṛ-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇḍu, (according to others also Mṛkaṇḍa); N. of
<div n="lb"/>an ancient sage (the reputed author or narrator of
<div n="lb"/>the Mārkaṇḍeya-Purāṇa); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the descend-
<div n="lb"/>ants of Mārkaṇḍeya; ({%am%}), n. {%= mārkaṇḍeyasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%tīrtham; (as, ī, am),%} delivered or composed by
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya. {%—Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa, am,%} n., N.
<div n="lb"/>of one of the eighteen Purāṇas, (in this Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>Jaimini, the pupil of Vyāsa, applies to Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/>to be made acquainted with the nature of Vāsudeva
<div n="lb"/>or Kṛṣṇa, and for an explanation of some of the
<div n="lb"/>incidents of the Mahā-bhārata; the sage excuses
<div n="lb"/>himself, and refers Jaimini to some sapient birds of
<div n="lb"/>celestial origin, residing in the Vindhya mountains,
<div n="lb"/>and profoundly versed in the Vedas; these birds,
<div n="lb"/>whose chief is called Piṅgākṣa, answer Jaimini's
[Page0773-b+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>questions and explain various difficult points, such as,
<div n="lb"/>‘Why was Vāsudeva born a mortal? How was it
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī became the wife of the five Pāṇḍus?’ &c.,
<div n="lb"/>&c. The answer to these inquiries and the addition
<div n="lb"/>of various legends constitute the bulk of this Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>and make it a kind of supplement to the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata; it differs from all the other Purāṇas in its
<div n="lb"/>narrative rather than sectarial character.)
