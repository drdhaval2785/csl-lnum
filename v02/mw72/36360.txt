{%Manu, us,%}¦ m. (Ved.) thought, mental faculty ({%=%}
<div n="lb"/>{%manana-śakti%}); (Ved.) a sacred text, prayer, incan-
<div n="lb"/>tation, spell ({%= mantra,%} perhaps erroneously thus
<div n="lb"/>explained in Mahā-bh. Ādi-p. 52); (Ved.) a man,
<div n="lb"/>mankind, as opposed to evil spirits, (in Ṛg-veda III.
<div n="lb"/>60, 3, the Ṛbhus are called the sons of man, {%ma-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%nor napātaḥ%}); the Man par excellence, or the repre-
<div n="lb"/>sentative man and father of the human race (regarded
<div n="lb"/>in the earlier mythological system as the first to
<div n="lb"/>have instituted sacrifices and religious ceremonies;
<div n="lb"/>and in Ṛg-veda 1. 139, 9, associated with the Ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva and Atri; in the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa de-
<div n="lb"/>scribed as dividing his possessions among some of
<div n="lb"/>his sons to the exclusion of one called Nābhā-
<div n="lb"/>nediṣṭha, q. v.; called Sāmvaraṇa as author of Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda IX. 101, 10-12; Āpsava as author of Rig-veda
<div n="lb"/>IX. 106, 7-9; in the fifth chapter of the Nighaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭavas numbered among the thirty-one divine beings
<div n="lb"/>of the upper sphere, and as father of men even iden-
<div n="lb"/>tified with Prajā-pati; but the name Manu is especially
<div n="lb"/>applied to fourteen successive mythical progenitors
<div n="lb"/>and sovereigns of the earth, described in the code of
<div n="lb"/>Manu 1. 63 and in the later mythology as creating
<div n="lb"/>and supporting this world of moving and stationary
<div n="lb"/>beings through successive Antaras or long periods of
<div n="lb"/>time, see {%manv-antara,%} col. 2: the first in order of
<div n="lb"/>these Manus is called Svāyambhuva, as sprung from
<div n="lb"/>{%Svayam-bhū,%} the Self-existent, who being identified
<div n="lb"/>with Brahmā, according to one account, divided
<div n="lb"/>himself into two persons, male and female, whence
<div n="lb"/>was produced Virāj, and from him the first Manu;
<div n="lb"/>or who, according to another account, converted
<div n="lb"/>himself at once into the first man called Manu
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva, and the first woman called Śata-rūpā;
<div n="lb"/>this Manu Svāyambhuva is described in Manu 1. 34
<div n="lb"/>as a sort of secondary creator, who commenced the
<div n="lb"/>work of creation by producing ten Prajāpatis or
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣis, of whom the first was {%Marici,%} Light,
<div n="lb"/>see {%prajā-pati;%} and to this first Manu is ascribed
<div n="lb"/>both the celebrated law-book known as the ‘code of
<div n="lb"/>Manu,’ see {%manu-saṃhitā,%} as well as an ancient
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra work on Kalpa or Vedic ritual; he is himself
<div n="lb"/>sometimes called Prajā-pati, and rarely Hairaṇya-
<div n="lb"/>garbha as son of Hiraṇya-garbha, and Prācetasa as
<div n="lb"/>son of Pracetas: the next five Manus in regular
<div n="lb"/>succession are called Svārociṣa, Auttami, Tāmasa.
<div n="lb"/>Raivata, Cākṣuṣa: the seventh Manu, called {%Vai-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vasvata,%} Sun-born, is the Manu of the present period;
<div n="lb"/>he is held to be the son of Vivasvat or the Sun, who
<div n="lb"/>according to Rāmāyaṇa 11. 110, 6, was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, son of Marīci, this latter being described
<div n="lb"/>as proceeding directly from Brahmā, and thus adding
<div n="lb"/>to the confusion in the different Hindū accounts of
<div n="lb"/>the gradation of personages interposed between the
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Being and the created world; this seventh
<div n="lb"/>Manu, called Vaivasvata, and sometimes, from his
<div n="lb"/>piety, Satya-vrata, is regarded as the progenitor of
<div n="lb"/>the present race of living beings, and has been com-
<div n="lb"/>pared to the Noah of the Old Testament from various
<div n="lb"/>legends current in Sanskrit literature of his preser-
<div n="lb"/>vation from a great flood by Viṣṇu or, according
<div n="lb"/>to some, by Brahmā in the form of a fish: he is
<div n="lb"/>also variously described as the son of Āditya or as
<div n="lb"/>one of the twelve Ādityas, as the author of the
<div n="lb"/>hymns Ṛg-veda VIII. 27-31, as the brother of Yama,
<div n="lb"/>who as son of the Sun is also called Vaivasvata, as the
<div n="lb"/>founder and first king of Ayodhyā, afterwards reigned
[Page0743-b+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>over by his son Ikṣvāku, and as father of Ilā who
<div n="lb"/>married Budha, son of the Moon, the two great solar
<div n="lb"/>and lunar races being thus nearly related to each
<div n="lb"/>other; the eighth Manu or first of the future Manus,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa 111. 2, will be Sā-
<div n="lb"/>varṇi; the ninth, Dakṣa-sāvarṇi; the tenth, Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>sāvarṇi; the eleventh, Dharma-sāvarṇi; the twelfth,
<div n="lb"/>Rudra-sāvarṇi; the thirteenth, Raucya or, accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to some, Deva-sāvarṇi; and the fourteenth,
