<div n="lb"/>water; a lake, large sheet of water, pond, pool; any

<div n="lb"/>1. 12. enumerated among the {%udaka-nāmāni,%} and
<div n="lb"/>in 1. 11. among the {%vāṅ-nāmāni%}); [cf. Old Norse
<div n="lb"/><nsi>sir, sœr, sior;</nsi> Angl. Sax. <nsi>sirendœ.</nsi>] {%—Saraḥ-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kāka, as,%} m. ‘water-crow,’ a gander; ({%ī%}), f. a
<div n="lb"/>goose. {%—Sarasi-ja, am,%} n. ‘pond-born,’ a lotus.
<div n="lb"/>{%—Sarasi-ruha, am,%} n. ‘growing in a pond,’ a
<div n="lb"/>lotus. {%—Sarasiruha-janman, ā,%} m. ‘born from
<div n="lb"/>a lotus,’ epithet of Brahmā. {%—Sarasī-ruha, am,%} n.
<div n="lb"/>‘pool-growing,’ a lotus. {%—Saras-tīra, am,%} n. the
<div n="lb"/>bank of a lake or pond. {%—Saras-vat, ān, atī, at,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘having water,’ watery, fluid, juicy, sapid; elegant;
<div n="lb"/>sentimental; ({%ān%}), m. the ocean; a male river; N.
<div n="lb"/>of a river-god, (in Ṛg-veda VII. 96, 4-6. assigned
<div n="lb"/>as a consort to Sarasvatī, see below); N. of Vāyu,
<div n="lb"/>(according to Sāy. on Ṛg-veda VII. 95, 3 {%=%}
<div n="lb"/>{%madhya-sthāno vayuḥ%}); a buffalo; ({%atī%}), f., N.
<div n="lb"/>of the goddess of speech and learning, (in the later
<div n="lb"/>mythology regarded as the wife or female energy of
<div n="lb"/>the god Brahmā or first deity of the Hindū triad
<div n="lb"/>[see {%brahman%}], and sometimes identified with Vāc,
<div n="lb"/>q. v., and invoked as a kind of muse or patroness of
<div n="lb"/>science and inventress of the Sanskrit language and
<div n="lb"/>letters; in the earliest mythology she was probably
<div n="lb"/>a river-deity, her name signifying ‘watery;’ according
<div n="lb"/>to Yāska [Nirukta II. 23] she was regarded both as
<div n="lb"/>a river and as a goddess; probably this river was to
<div n="lb"/>the earlier Hindūs what the Ganges [said to be only
<div n="lb"/>twice named in the Ṛg-veda] was to the later;
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices were doubtless performed on its banks, and
<div n="lb"/>its sanctity imparted a sacred character to the district
<div n="lb"/>lying between its waters and those of the Dṛṣad-
<div n="lb"/>vatī [see Manu II. 17]; hence the river Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>was not only personified as a river-goddess, but her
<div n="lb"/>assistance was invoked at the sacrifices performed
<div n="lb"/>near her flowing waters and her influence held to
<div n="lb"/>be necessary for inspiring the Ṛṣis who composed
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial hymns with eloquence and wisdom; in
<div n="lb"/>Ṛg-veda II. 41, 16. she is called the best of mothers,
<div n="lb"/>of rivers, and of goddesses; in other places she is
<div n="lb"/>described as bestowing wealth, fertility, and offspring,
<div n="lb"/>as moving along a golden path, as destroying Vṛtra,
<div n="lb"/>as associated with the Aśvins, and even as the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Indra; in Ṛg-veda VI. 61, 10-12, VII. 36, 6.
<div n="lb"/>she is called the mother of rivers, and is said to be
<div n="lb"/>sevenfold or to have seven sisters; in Mahā-bhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Śalya-parvan 2189, seven Sarasvatīs are also men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned, viz. Su-prabhā, Kāñcanākṣī, Viśālā, Mano-
<div n="lb"/>ramā, Ogha-vatī, Su-reṇu, and Vimalodakā; in the
<div n="lb"/>Śānti-parvan 12920, Sarasvatī is called the mother
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedas, which is also elsewhere said of Vāc,
<div n="lb"/>though Vāc in the earlier mythology is regarded as
<div n="lb"/>a separate deity; according to later legends the
<div n="lb"/>goddess Sarasvatī was persuaded to descend from
<div n="lb"/>heaven and confer her invention of language and
<div n="lb"/>letters on the human race by the sage Bharata,
[Page1093-a+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>whence one of her names is Bhāratī; she is some-
<div n="lb"/>times represented as assuming the form of a Haṃsa
<div n="lb"/>or swan, and is also called Mahā-śvetā or Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>śuklā from her extreme whiteness); N. of a cele-
<div n="lb"/>brated river (held very sacred by the Hindūs and in
<div n="lb"/>the earlier mythology mixed up with the goddess
<div n="lb"/>[see above]; it corresponds with the modern Sur-
<div n="lb"/>sooty, which rises in the mountains bounding the
<div n="lb"/>north-east part of the province of Delhi, and running
<div n="lb"/>in a south-westerly direction becomes lost in the
<div n="lb"/>sands of the great desert; this river formerly marked
<div n="lb"/>one of the boundaries of the region called Ārya-deśa,
<div n="lb"/>and of a particularly sacred district called in Manu
<div n="lb"/>II. 17. Brahmāvarta; in Ṛg-veda VII. 95, 2. it is
<div n="lb"/>represented as flowing into the sea, although later
<div n="lb"/>legends make it disappear underground and join the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges and Jumnā at Allahabad, see {%tri-veṇī, pra-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yāga%}); a river (in general); speech, voice, eloquence,
<div n="lb"/>literary composition; a cow ({%= go%}); N. of Durgā;
<div n="lb"/>an excellent woman; N. of the wife of a Manu;
<div n="lb"/>of the wife of Maṇḍana (see {%maṇḍana-miśra%}); a
<div n="lb"/>female divinity peculiar to the Buddhists or Jainas;
<div n="lb"/>the moon-plant Asclepias Acida ({%= soma-latā, brāh-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%mī%}); N. of another plant ({%= jyotiṣ-matī%}); N.
<div n="lb"/>of a celebrated grammarian, (in this and the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing senses masc.); N. of various learned men.
