<div n="lb"/>modern or bright Yajur-veda being attributed to
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya, of the family of the Vājasaneyins: the
<div n="lb"/>legend relates that the Yajus in its original form
<div n="lb"/>was first taught by the sage Vaiśampāyana to twenty-
<div n="lb"/>seven pupils, Yājñavalkya being deputed by him to
<div n="lb"/>teach it to others; subsequently the sage being
<div n="lb"/>offended with Yājñavalkya, bade him relinquish the
<div n="lb"/>Veda committed to him, which he instantly disgorged
<div n="lb"/>in a tangible form; whereupon the other disciples of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśampāyana receiving his command to pick it up,
<div n="lb"/>assumed the form of partridges for that purpose, and
<div n="lb"/>swallowed the texts, which were soiled, and hence
<div n="lb"/>named ‘black,’ the other name {%taittirīya%} having
<div n="lb"/>reference to the partridges. Yājñavalkya then had
<div n="lb"/>recourse to the Sun, and from that deity received a
<div n="lb"/>new revelation of the Yajus, which is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>called ‘white,’ and sometimes from the patronymic
<div n="lb"/>of Yājñavalkya, Vājasaneyin.) {%—Taittirīyāraṇyaka%}
