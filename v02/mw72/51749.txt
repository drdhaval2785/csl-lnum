{#sANKya#}¦ {%sāṅkhya, as, ā, am,%} (fr. {%saṅ-khyā%}),
<div n="lb"/>relating to number or calculation, reckoning up, cal-
<div n="lb"/>culating, enumerating, deliberating, reasoning; ra-
<div n="lb"/>tional, discriminative; ({%as, am%}), m. n., N. of one
<div n="lb"/>of the three great divisions of Hindū philosophy,
<div n="lb"/>(ascribed to the sage Kapila, q. v., and so called as
<div n="lb"/>‘reckoning up’ or ‘enumerating’ twenty-five Tat-
<div n="lb"/>tvas or true principles, its object being to effect the
<div n="lb"/>final liberation of the twenty-fifth Tattva [Puruṣa,
<div n="lb"/>the Soul] from the fetters of the phenomenal crea-
<div n="lb"/>tion by conveying the correct knowledge of the
<div n="lb"/>twenty-four other Tattvas, and rightly discriminating
<div n="lb"/>the Soul from them; these twenty-four principles
<div n="lb"/>are divided into eight Prakṛtis or Producers and six-
<div n="lb"/>teen Vikāras or Productions; the eight Producers
<div n="lb"/>start from a Mūla-prakṛti or original Producer
<div n="lb"/>[variously called Pradhāna, ‘chief one;’ A-vyakta,
<div n="lb"/>‘unevolved;’ Brahman, ‘supreme;’ Māyā, ‘power
<div n="lb"/>of illusion;’ Bahu-dhānaka, ‘much-containing’],
[Page1103-b+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>which is emphatically <nsi>the</nsi> Prakṛti, ‘First-producer,’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘Originant,’ being a kind of primordial germ whence
<div n="lb"/>all the twenty-three remaining Tattvas are evolved;
<div n="lb"/>its first production is the 2nd Tattva, viz. Buddhi,
<div n="lb"/>Intellect [sometimes called {%Mahat%} from its being
<div n="lb"/>the great source of the two other internal organs
<div n="lb"/>or instruments, Ahaṅkāra and Manas, which are
<div n="lb"/>both modifications of it]; 3rd in order comes Ahaṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kāra, ‘the I-making’ principle or sense of indi-
<div n="lb"/>viduality; 4th come the five Tan-mātras or subtile
<div n="lb"/>elementary particles out of which the five grosser
<div n="lb"/>elements are evolved; the preceding eight principles
<div n="lb"/>constitute the Producers, [all but the first being of
<div n="lb"/>course in one sense also Productions]; then follow,
<div n="lb"/>as proceeding from the Tan-mātras, the five Sthūla-
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas or grosser elements [also called Mahā-bhūta],
<div n="lb"/>viz. a. {%ākāśa,%} space or ether, having the Guṇa or
<div n="lb"/>property of sound [{%śabda%}], which is the Viṣaya
<div n="lb"/>or object of apprehension for the corresponding
<div n="lb"/>Indriya or organ, the Ear; b. {%vāyu,%} air, having the
<div n="lb"/>Guṇa or property of tangibility or touch [{%sparśa%}],
<div n="lb"/>which is the Viṣaya for the Skin; c. {%tejas%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%jyotis,%} fire or light, having the property of form or
<div n="lb"/>colour [{%rūpa%}], which is the Viṣaya for the Eye;
<div n="lb"/>d. {%āpas,%} water, having the property of savour or
<div n="lb"/>taste [{%rasa%}], which is the Viṣaya for the Tongue;
<div n="lb"/>e. {%pṛthivī%} or {%bhūmi,%} earth, having the property of
<div n="lb"/>odour or smell [{%gandha%}], which is the Viṣaya for
<div n="lb"/>the Nose, [see {%guṇa%}]; each of these elements after
<div n="lb"/>the first having also the Guṇa or Guṇas of the pre-
<div n="lb"/>ceding besides its own, and these Guṇas being some-
<div n="lb"/>times identified with the Tan-mātras; then follow
<div n="lb"/>the eleven organs, produced like the Tan-mātras from
<div n="lb"/>the 3rd Tattva Ahaṅkāra, forming with them a
<div n="lb"/>class of sixteen [{%ṣoḍaśakaḥ%}]; these eleven organs
<div n="lb"/>are the five above-named Buddhīndriyāṇi or organs
<div n="lb"/>of sense, viz. ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose; the five
<div n="lb"/>Karmendriyāṇi or organs of action, viz. larynx, hand,
<div n="lb"/>foot, arms, and organ of generation; and an eleventh
<div n="lb"/>organ called Manas, commonly translated ‘mind,’
<div n="lb"/>which stands between both sets of Indriyas as an in-
<div n="lb"/>ternal organ of perception and action, or of cogni-
<div n="lb"/>tion and volition, [see {%manas%}]: the twenty-fifth
<div n="lb"/>Tattva, Puruṣa or Soul, is to be wholly distinguished
<div n="lb"/>from the twenty-four just enumerated; it is neither
<div n="lb"/>a Producer nor Production; it is altogether passive,
<div n="lb"/>and simply a looker-on, having nothing whatever to
<div n="lb"/>do with the acts of creation, which it only contem-
<div n="lb"/>plates, uniting itself with unintelligent Prakṛti, as
<div n="lb"/>a lame man mounted on a blind man's shoulders,
<div n="lb"/>for the sake of observing and enjoying the acts of
<div n="lb"/>this Prakṛti, who herself cannot see or observe any-
<div n="lb"/>thing; without that union no creation can take
<div n="lb"/>place any more than can the birth of a child without
<div n="lb"/>the union of male and female; this view of creation
<div n="lb"/>implies the eternal existence of innumerable separate
<div n="lb"/>individual souls, each soul by its junction with Pra-
<div n="lb"/>kṛti causing the creation of its own phenomenal
<div n="lb"/>world, which world, however, has an existence of
<div n="lb"/>its own independent of all connection with the par-
<div n="lb"/>ticular Puruṣa to which it is joined; moreover, each
<div n="lb"/>soul is invested in the first place with a subtile body
<div n="lb"/>[{%liṅga-śarīra%} or {%sūkṣma-śarīra%}] composed of
<div n="lb"/>Buddhi, Ahaṅkāra, the five Tan-mātras, and the
<div n="lb"/>eleven organs, and afterwards with a grosser body
<div n="lb"/>formed of the five elements; the former accompany-
<div n="lb"/>ing the soul through all its transmigrations, while the
<div n="lb"/>latter perishes; this system also teaches that Prakṛti
<div n="lb"/>and its products may be regarded as made up of
<div n="lb"/>three ingredients in a state of equipoise, viz. Sattva,
<div n="lb"/>Rajas, and Tamas, Goodness, Passion, and Darkness,
<div n="lb"/>commonly called Guṇas, but rather substances than
<div n="lb"/>qualities, and more correctly translated ‘fetters,’ be-
<div n="lb"/>cause they are like a triple-stranded rope [see
<div n="lb"/>{%guṇa%}] which binds and confines the soul: the Sāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>khya system agrees with the Vedānta in being
<div n="lb"/>synthetical, and so differing from the Analytical
<div n="lb"/>Nyāya; its great point of divergence from the
<div n="lb"/>Vedānta is in maintaining two principles which the
<div n="lb"/>Vedānta denies, [see {%vedānta%}]; it is said to be
<div n="lb"/>atheistical as ignoring all notice of a Supreme Soul,
[Page1103-c+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>whose existence is, however, established by the Yoga
<div n="lb"/>branch of the Sāṅkhya proper, [see {%yoga%}]: the
<div n="lb"/>vague outlines of the system before its crystallization
<div n="lb"/>into a distinct school of dualism are propounded in
<div n="lb"/>the first Book of Manu: its more fully developed
<div n="lb"/>doctrines are contained in the Sāṅkhya-sūtras ascribed
<div n="lb"/>to Kapila, in the Tattva-samāsa, or Summary of
<div n="lb"/>Principles, ascribed to the same author, in the
<div n="lb"/>Sāṅkhya-kārikā [see below], and the numerous
<div n="lb"/>commentaries on these works, some of which are
<div n="lb"/>enumerated below: the Buddhist system and that
<div n="lb"/>of bishop Berkeley in Europe have many points of
<div n="lb"/>connection with the Sāṅkhya, but the modern phi-
<div n="lb"/>losophers of India pay far more attention to the
<div n="lb"/>Nyāya and Vedānta); a follower of the Sāṅkhya
