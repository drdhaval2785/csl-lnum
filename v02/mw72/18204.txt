{#cana#}¦ {%cana%} (originally for {%ca+na%}), ind. and
<div n="lb"/>not, also not, even not, not even; even, also, and.
<div n="lb"/>This particle is placed after the word to which it
<div n="lb"/>gives force; and in Vedic Sanskrit is generally, but
<div n="lb"/>not always, found without any other negative particle,
<div n="lb"/>whereas in the later language another negative is
<div n="lb"/>usually added (e. g. {%āpaś cana pra minanti vrataṃ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vām,%} not even the waters violate your ordinance;
<div n="lb"/>{%nāha vivyāca pṛthivī canainam,%} the earth even
<div n="lb"/>does not contain him). When {%cana%} is added to the
<div n="lb"/>interrogatives {%ka, katara, katama, kad, kim,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%katham, kadā, kutas, kva,%} it makes them in-
<div n="lb"/>definite; see 2. {%ka,%} &c.
