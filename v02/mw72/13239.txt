{#ka#} 2¦. {%ka, kas, kā, kim,%} interrog. pron. (see
<div n="lb"/>{%kim%} and 2. {%kad,%} and cf. the following words in which
<div n="lb"/>the interrogative base {%ka%} appears, {%katama, katara,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kati, katham, kadā, karhi, kā,%} &c.), who? which?
<div n="lb"/>what? In its declension {%ka%} follows the pronoun {%tad%}
<div n="lb"/>(Gram. 223) except in nom. acc. sing. neut., where
<div n="lb"/>{%kim%} has taken the place of {%kad%} or {%kat%} in classical
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit; but the old form {%kad%} is found in the Veda.
<div n="P"/>The interrogative sentence introduced by {%ka%} is often
<div n="lb"/>terminated by {%iti%} (e. g. {%kasya sa putra iti kath-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yatām,%} let it be said, ‘whose son is he?’), but {%iti%}
<div n="lb"/>may be omitted and the sentence lose its direct
<div n="lb"/>interrogative character (e. g. {%kasya sa putro na%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jñāyate,%} it is not known whose son he is). {%Ka%} with
<div n="lb"/>or without {%as,%} ‘to be,’ may express ‘how is it possible
<div n="lb"/>that?’ ‘what power have I, you, they, &c.?’ (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%ke mama dhanvino 'nye,%} what can the other archers
<div n="lb"/>do against me? {%ke āvām paritrātum,%} what power
<div n="lb"/>have we to rescue you?). {%Ka%} is often connected
<div n="lb"/>with a demonstrative pron. (e. g. {%ko 'yam āyāti,%} who
<div n="lb"/>comes here?) or with the potential (e. g. {%ko Hariṃ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%nindet,%} who will blame Hari?). {%Ka%} is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>repeated (e. g. {%kaḥ ko 'tra,%} who is there? {%kān kān,%}
<div n="lb"/>whom? whom? i. e. which of them? cf. Gram. 53. <nsi>a</nsi>),
<div n="lb"/>and the repetition is often due to a kind of attrac-
<div n="lb"/>tion (e. g. {%keṣāṃ kiṃ śāstram adhyayanīyam,%}
<div n="lb"/>which book is to be read by whom? Gram. 836. <nsi>a</nsi>).
<div n="lb"/>When {%kim%} is connected with the inst. c. of a noun
<div n="lb"/>or with the indecl. participle it may express ‘what is
<div n="lb"/>gained by doing so, &c.?’ (e. g. {%nīrujaḥ kim au-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṣadhaiḥ,%} what is the use of medicine to the healthy?
<div n="lb"/>{%kiṃ vilambena,%} what is gained by delay? {%kim ba-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%hunā,%} what is the use of more words? {%kim pauru-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṣaṃ hatvā suptam,%} what manliness is there in
<div n="lb"/>killing one asleep ?).
