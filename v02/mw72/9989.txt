{#iva#}¦ {%iva,%} ind. (fr. pronominal base 3. {%i%}),
<div n="lb"/>like, in the same manner as (in this sense {%= yathā,%}
<div n="lb"/>and used correlatively to {%tathā%}); as it were (after a
<div n="lb"/>metaphorical expression, e. g. {%pathā iva yantau,%}
<div n="lb"/>on a path going as it were); in a certain manner, in
<div n="lb"/>some measure, a little, perhaps (in qualification or
<div n="lb"/>mitigation of a strong assertion); nearly, almost, about
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%muhūrtam iva,%} almost an hour); so, just so,
<div n="lb"/>just, exactly, indeed, very (especially after words
<div n="lb"/>which involve some restriction, e. g. {%īṣad iva,%} just
<div n="lb"/>a little; {%kiñcid iva,%} just a little bit: and after a nega-
<div n="lb"/>tion, e. g. {%nacirād iva,%} very soon). {%Iva%} is connected
<div n="lb"/>vaguely, and somewhat pleonastically, with an inter-
<div n="lb"/>rogative pronoun or adverb (e. g. {%kim iva,%} what ?
<div n="lb"/>{%katham iva,%} how could that possibly be ? {%kveva,%}
<div n="lb"/>where, I should like to know ?). In the Pada texts
<div n="lb"/>of the Ṛg, Yajur, and Atharva-veda, and by native
<div n="lb"/>grammarians, {%iva%} is considered to be compounded
<div n="lb"/>with the word after which it stands, and is therefore
<div n="lb"/>enclitic.
