<div n="lb"/>{%a,%} n., N. of the tenth book of the Mahā-bhārata
<div n="lb"/>(in which is described how the three surviving Kuru
<div n="lb"/>warriors, Aśvatthāman, Kṛta-varman, and Kṛpa,
<div n="lb"/>after the destruction of their army, determined on
<div n="lb"/>attacking the camp of the Pāṇḍavas by night and
<div n="lb"/>murdering them while asleep; this they accordingly
<div n="lb"/>did, Aśvatthāman entering the camp stealthily and,
<div n="lb"/>with the assistance of the god Śiva, slaughtering
<div n="lb"/>thousands, while the two others stood at the gate
<div n="lb"/>and killed all who attempted to escape; the whole
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍava army was thus destroyed, except the five
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu princes themselves, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki,
<div n="lb"/>who were stationed at some distance from the camp;
<div n="lb"/>a messenger having escaped conveyed the news to
<div n="lb"/>Yudhi-ṣṭhira, who, with his brothers and Draupadī,
<div n="lb"/>then returned to the camp and bewailed their
<div n="lb"/>slaughtered kindred).
