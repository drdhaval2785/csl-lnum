<div n="lb"/>of the chapters into which the Muṇḍakopaniṣad is

<div n="lb"/>a well-known Upaniṣad of the Atharva-veda (con-
<div n="lb"/>taining three short chapters or Muṇḍakas, each of
<div n="lb"/>which comprises two sections or Khaṇḍas, and said

<div n="lb"/>every one who comprehends its secret doctrine is
<div n="lb"/>‘shorn,’ i. e. liberated from all error, a similar idea
<div n="lb"/>being probably involved in the name of the Kṣuri-
<div n="lb"/>kopanishad or ‘Razor Upaniṣad:’ the Muṇḍaka
<div n="lb"/>is one of the most interesting of the numerous Upa-
<div n="lb"/>niṣads, on account of the reasons which it gives
<div n="lb"/>for the superiority of these works over the Veda and
<div n="lb"/>its ritual; thus, according to Muṇḍaka I. 4, there
<div n="lb"/>are two sciences, the higher and the inferior; the
<div n="lb"/>inferior is the knowledge of the Ṛg-veda, Yajur-
<div n="lb"/>veda, Sāma-veda, Atharva-veda, pronunciation, ritual,
<div n="lb"/>grammar, explanation of Vedic texts, prosody, and
<div n="lb"/>the astronomical calendar; but the higher knowledge
<div n="lb"/>is that by which the imperishable Brahma is com-

<div n="lb"/>prehended). {%—Muṇḍakopaniṣad-dīpikā,%} f., N. of
<div n="lb"/>a commentary on the above.
