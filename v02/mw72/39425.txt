{%Rāvaṇa, as, ī, am%}¦ (fr. the Caus.), screaming, roar-
<div n="lb"/>ing, crying, bellowing, bewailing, making lamentation;
[Page0844-b+ 77]
<div n="lb"/>({%as%}), m. ‘the Vociferator,’ N. of the ruler of Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>or Ceylon and the famous chief of the Rākṣasas or
<div n="lb"/>demons whose subjugation and destruction by Rāma-
<div n="lb"/>candra, the seventh incarnation of Viṣṇu, form the
<div n="lb"/>subject of the Rāmāyaṇa, (as son of Viśravas, he was
<div n="lb"/>younger brother of Kuvera, but by a different mother,
<div n="lb"/>Ilavilā being the mother of Kuvera, and Keśinī of
<div n="lb"/>the three other brothers, Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, and
<div n="lb"/>Kumbha-karṇa; both Rāvaṇa and Kuvera, the god
<div n="lb"/>of wealth, are often called Paulastya, as grandchildren
<div n="lb"/>of the Ṛṣi Pulastya, one of the seven or ten mind-
<div n="lb"/>born sons of Brahmā, and as Kuvera is king of the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas, so is Rāvaṇa of the Rākṣasas, the latter,
<div n="lb"/>however, are always malignant beings [see {%rākṣasa%}],
<div n="lb"/>and Rāvaṇa himself is one of the worst of the many
<div n="lb"/>impersonations of evil common in Hindū mythology;
<div n="lb"/>he is the Satan of the Rāmāyaṇa as Duryodhana is
<div n="lb"/>of the Mahā-bhārata; he has ten heads [whence his
<div n="lb"/>names Daśa-grīva, Daśānana, &c.] and twenty arms,
<div n="lb"/>symbolizing strength; his power is described as so
<div n="lb"/>great, that where he is ‘there the sun does not give
<div n="lb"/>out its heat, the winds through fear of him do not
<div n="lb"/>blow, the fire ceases to burn, and the ocean becomes
<div n="lb"/>motionless;’ he even, by his power, defeated his own
<div n="lb"/>brother Vaiśravaṇa or Kuvera, and carried off his self-
<div n="lb"/>moving car, called Puṣpaka, the wonders of which
<div n="lb"/>are described in the Rāmāyaṇa; this potency was,
<div n="lb"/>as usual, acquired by self-inflicted austerities, which
<div n="lb"/>had obtained from Brahmā a boon, in virtue of which
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa was invulnerable by gods and divine beings
<div n="lb"/>of all kinds, though not by men or a god in human
<div n="lb"/>form; as Viṣṇu became incarnate in Rāma-candra
<div n="lb"/>to destroy Rāvaṇa, so other gods produced innume-
<div n="lb"/>rable monkeys, bears, and various semi-divine animals
<div n="lb"/>to do battle with the legions of demons, his subjects,
<div n="lb"/>under Khara, Dūṣaṇa, and his other generals; see
<div n="lb"/>{%hanu-mat%}); a patronymic from Ravaṇa; N. of the
<div n="lb"/>author of a commentary on the Sāma-veda; of one
<div n="lb"/>on the Ṛg-veda; of the author of the Arka-cikitsā;
<div n="lb"/>of a king of Kaśmīra (mentioned together with Indra-
<div n="lb"/>jit and Vibhīṣaṇa); ({%am%}), n. the act of screaming,
<div n="lb"/>&c.; N. of a Muhūrta. {%—Rāvaṇa-gaṅgā,%} f. ‘Rā-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇa's Ganges,’ N. of a river in Laṅkā (called after
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasa Rāvaṇa). {%—Rāvaṇa-hasra,%} a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular stringed instrument. {%—Rāvaṇa-hrada, as,%} m.,
<div n="lb"/>N. of a lake (from which the Śata-dru or Sutlej
<div n="lb"/>takes its rise). {%—Rāvaṇāri (°ṇa-ari), is,%} m. Rā-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇa's enemy, i. e. Rāma.
