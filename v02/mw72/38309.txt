{%Yajus, us,%}¦ n. religious reverence, veneration, wor-
<div n="lb"/>ship, oblation, sacrifice (Ved.); that by which a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice is effected, a sacrificial prayer or formula; a
<div n="lb"/>text of the Yajur-veda or rather a technical term for
<div n="lb"/>certain words or Mantras muttered in a peculiar
<div n="lb"/>manner at a sacrifice, (these Mantras were properly
<div n="lb"/>in prose as distinguished from the metrical {%ṛc%} which
<div n="lb"/>was recited, and the metrical {%sāman%} which was
<div n="lb"/>sung, see {%mantra,%} 2. {%ṛc;%} although, however, the
<div n="lb"/>prose Yajus is a distinctive feature of the Yajur-veda,
<div n="lb"/>this Veda is in real fact chiefly composed of verses
<div n="lb"/>taken from the Ṛg-veda, which may then also be
<div n="lb"/>called Yajus, cf. {%Yajur-veda%} below); N. of the
<div n="lb"/>Yajur-veda, q. v., (in this sense also frequently {%ya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jūṃṣi,%} n. pl.); ({%us%}), m., N. of a man. {%—Yajuḥ-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śākhin, ī, inī, i,%} familiar with a Śākhā of the
<div n="lb"/>Yajur-veda. {%—Yajur-maya, as, ī, am,%} consisting of
<div n="lb"/>verses of the Yajur-veda; [cf. {%ṛṅ-maya.%}] {%—Yajur-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%lakṣmī, īs,%} f., N. of a particular formula. {%—Yajur-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vid, t, t, t,%} knowing the Yajus, conversant with
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial formulas, one who is familiar with the
<div n="lb"/>Yajur-veda. {%—Yajur-vidhāna, am,%} n., N. of a work.
<div n="lb"/>{%—Yajur-veda, as,%} m. ‘the sacrificial Veda,’ the
<div n="lb"/>collective body of sacred Mantras or texts which con-
<div n="lb"/>stitute the Yajur-veda, (these Mantras, though often
<div n="lb"/>consisting of the prose Yajus, are frequently identical
<div n="lb"/>with the Mantras of the Ṛg-veda, the Yajur-veda
<div n="lb"/>being only a collection of liturgical forms or rather a
<div n="lb"/>sort of sacrificial prayer-book for the Adhvaryu priests
<div n="lb"/>formed out of the Ṛg-veda, which had to be dissected
<div n="lb"/>and re-arranged with additional texts for sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>purposes; to serve these purposes, the hymns of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛg-veda are scattered about piecemeal, verses of the
<div n="lb"/>same hymn being often transposed, verses from dif-
<div n="lb"/>ferent hymns combined, and even those of different
<div n="lb"/>poets brought together into one and the same hymn;
<div n="lb"/>in fact the compilation of the Yajur-veda resulted
<div n="lb"/>from the gradual growth of a complicated ritual in
<div n="lb"/>connection with those sacrifices without which the
<div n="lb"/>Hindū believed it was impossible to secure the favour
<div n="lb"/>of his gods, and for the performance of which the
<div n="lb"/>unsystematic collection of hymns in the Ṛg-veda
<div n="lb"/>was unsuited: the great characteristic feature of the
<div n="lb"/>Yajur-veda is its division into two distinct collections
<div n="lb"/>of texts, the one called Taittirīya-saṃhitā or Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>i. e. ‘Black’ [because in it the Saṃhitā or simple
<div n="lb"/>collection of texts and Brāhmaṇa or explanation of
<div n="lb"/>the rites in which the texts were employed is con-
[Page0802-c+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>fused]; the other called Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā or Śukla,
<div n="lb"/>i. e. ‘White’ [because in this, which is thought to be
<div n="lb"/>the more recent of the two recensions, the Saṃhitā is
<div n="lb"/>cleared from confusion with its Brāhmaṇa, and there-
<div n="lb"/>fore looks white and orderly]: the order of sacrifices,
<div n="lb"/>however, of both divisions of the Yajur-veda is simi-
<div n="lb"/>lar, two of the principal being the Darśa-pūrṇa-māsa
<div n="lb"/>or sacrifice to be performed at new and full moon, and
<div n="lb"/>the Aśva-medha or horse-sacrifice; cf. {%Taittirīya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%saṃhitā, Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā.%}) {%—Yajurveda-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śrāddha,%} N. of a work (treating of the prayers and
