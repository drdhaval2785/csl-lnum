{%Mīmāṃsā,%}¦ f. reflection, consideration, opinion,
<div n="lb"/>investigation, examination, discussion, ({%kāvya-m°,%}
<div n="lb"/>the theory of poetry, art of poetry; N. of a work);
<div n="lb"/>‘examination (of the sacred text),’ N. of one of three
<div n="lb"/>great divisions of orthodox Hindū philosophy (divided
<div n="lb"/>like the Nyāya and Sāṅkhya into two systems, viz.
<div n="lb"/>the Pūrva-mīmāṃsā or Karma-mīmāṃsā founded by
<div n="lb"/>Jaimini, and the Uttara-mīmāṃsā or Brahma-mīmāṃsā
<div n="lb"/>or Śārīraka-mīmāṃsā by Bādarāyaṇa, the latter, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, is more commonly called the Vedānta system,
<div n="lb"/>while the Pūrva-mīmāṃsā is usually called <nsi>the</nsi>
<div n="lb"/>Mīmāṃsā; though the Mīmāṃsā by Jaimini is classed
<div n="lb"/>among the six orthodox systems of philosophy, it
<div n="lb"/>does not concern itself like the others with the
<div n="lb"/>nature of soul, mind, and matter, but rather with a
<div n="lb"/>correct interpretation of the ritual of the Veda and
<div n="lb"/>the solution of doubts and discrepancies in regard to
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic texts caused by the discordant explanations
<div n="lb"/>of opposite schools; it may therefore be described as
<div n="lb"/>a critical commentary on the first or ritual portion
<div n="lb"/>of the Veda, and its only claim to the title of a
<div n="lb"/>philosophy consists in its philosophical method of
<div n="lb"/>interpretation, the topics being arranged according
<div n="lb"/>to particular categories, such as authoritativeness,
<div n="lb"/>indirect precept, &c., and treated according to a
<div n="lb"/>kind of logical sequence, which commences with
<div n="lb"/>the proposition to be discussed, the doubt arising
<div n="lb"/>about it, the Pūrva-pakṣa or primâ facie and wrong
<div n="lb"/>view of the question, the right argument or refuta-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the Pūrva-pakṣa, and the conclusion; see,
[Page0780-c+ 78]
<div n="lb"/>moreover, {%Pūrva-mīmāṃsā:%} Jaimini, whose date is
<div n="lb"/>unknown, taught his system in twelve books, each
<div n="lb"/>book containing either four or eight chapters, and
<div n="lb"/>each chapter being subdivided into sections compris-
<div n="lb"/>ing one or more Sūtras; the oldest commentary on
<div n="lb"/>these obscure aphorisms being the Bhāṣya of Śabara-
<div n="lb"/>svāmin, explained by the great Mīmāṃsā authority
<div n="lb"/>Kumārila-svāmin or Kumārila-bhaṭṭa, and again elu-
<div n="lb"/>cidated by Mādhavācārya in the Jaiminīya-nyāya-
