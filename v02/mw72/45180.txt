<div n="lb"/>or Śrī-sampradāyins, founded by the celebrated re-
<div n="lb"/>former Rāmānuja, who flourished in the south of
<div n="lb"/>India towards the latter part of the twelfth century;
<div n="lb"/>the most striking peculiarity of this sect, who are

<div n="lb"/>of the hair to the commencement of each eyebrow,
<div n="lb"/>and a connecting transverse streak across the root of
<div n="lb"/>the nose; their chief authoritative works are the
<div n="lb"/>Vedānta-sūtras and other Vedānta works, the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>rātra of Nārada, the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa and other Pu-
<div n="lb"/>rāṇas: 2. the Rāmānandas, a sect founded by Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>nanda, disciple of Rāmānuja, and very numerous in
<div n="lb"/>Gangetic India; they worship Viṣṇu under the form
<div n="lb"/>of Rāma-candra and his consort Sītā; their favourite
<div n="lb"/>work is the Bhakta-mālā: 3. the followers of Kabīr,

<div n="lb"/>dhvācārya, who is regarded by his followers as an
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Vāyu, the god of wind; they are
<div n="lb"/>found especially in the south of India, and appear to
<div n="lb"/>combine with their worship of Viṣṇu a friendly
<div n="lb"/>leaning towards the god Śiva: 6. the Vaiṣṇavas of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal, a sect founded by Caitanya, who is regarded
<div n="lb"/>as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa; their chief ritual con-
