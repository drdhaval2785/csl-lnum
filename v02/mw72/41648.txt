{%Vasiṣṭha, as,%}¦ m. (superl. of {%vasu%} or {%vasu-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%mat;%} cf. {%vasīyas%}), ‘the most wealthy,’ N. of a very
<div n="lb"/>celebrated Vedic Ṛṣi or inspired sage (owner of
<div n="lb"/>the ‘cow of plenty,’ called Nandinī, offspring of
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi, which by granting all desires made him, as
<div n="lb"/>his name implies, master of every {%vasu%} or desirable
<div n="lb"/>object; he was the typical representative of Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>manical dignity, and the legends of his conflict with
<div n="lb"/>Viśvā-mitra, who raised himself from the military
<div n="lb"/>to the sacerdotal class, though probably founded on
<div n="lb"/>the actual struggles which took place between the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmans and Kṣatriyas, were doubtless mostly in-
<div n="lb"/>vented to impress the mind with the power and
<div n="lb"/>superiority of the priesthood; a great many hymns
<div n="lb"/>of the Ṛg-veda are ascribed to these two great
<div n="lb"/>rivals, those of the seventh Maṇḍala, besides some
<div n="lb"/>others, being attributed to Vasiṣṭha, while those of
<div n="lb"/>the third Maṇḍala are assigned to Viśvā-mitra; in
<div n="lb"/>one of Vasiṣṭha's hymns he is represented as king
<div n="lb"/>Su-dās's family priest, an office to which Viśvā-mitra
[Page0896-c+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>also aspired; in another hymn Vasiṣṭha claims to
<div n="lb"/>have been inspired by Varuṇa, and in another [Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda VII. 33, 11] he is called the son of the Apsaras
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī by Mitra and Varuṇa, whence his patronymic
<div n="lb"/>Maitrāvaruṇi; in Manu I. 35. he is enumerated
<div n="lb"/>among the ten Prajā-patis or Patriarchs produced by
<div n="lb"/>Manu Svāyambhuva for the peopling of the universe;
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahā-bhārata he is mentioned as the family
<div n="lb"/>priest of the solar race or family of Ikṣvāku and
<div n="lb"/>Rāma-candra, and in the Purāṇas as one of the
<div n="lb"/>arrangers of the Vedas in the Dvāpara age; in the
<div n="lb"/>first and second chapters of the Raghu-vaṃśa he is
<div n="lb"/>described as releasing king Dilīpa from his curse of
<div n="lb"/>childlessness by directing him to attend upon the cow
<div n="lb"/>Nandinī in atonement for an offence he had uninten-
<div n="lb"/>tionally committed against the parent cow Surabhi;
<div n="lb"/>according to one account Vasiṣṭha married Ūrjā,
<div n="lb"/>‘Strength;’ according to another, Arundhatī, one of
<div n="lb"/>the Pleiades, by whom he had seven sons [see
<div n="lb"/>{%arundhatī%}]; other legends make him one of the
<div n="lb"/>seven great patriarchal sages regarded as forming the
<div n="lb"/>stars of the Great Bear [see {%ṛṣi%}]; his name is often
<div n="lb"/>written Vaśiṣṭha, q. v., in which case it must be
<div n="lb"/>connected with {%vaśa%} and {%vaśin%}); N. of the author
<div n="lb"/>of a law-book (perhaps intended to be ascribed to
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Ṛṣi above); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the family of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha; ({%Vasiṣṭhasyāṅkuśa%} and {%Vasiṣṭhasyā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%nupadam,%} N. of two Sāmans.) {%—Vasiṣṭha-tantra,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%am,%} n., N. of a Tantra work. {%—Vasiṣṭha-putra,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ās,%} m. pl. ‘the sons or descendants of Vasiṣṭha,’ N.
<div n="lb"/>of the authors of Ṛg-veda VII. 33, 10-14. {%—Va-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%siṣṭha-pramukha, as, ā, am,%} preceded or led
<div n="lb"/>by Vasiṣṭha. {%—Vasiṣṭha-prācī,%} f., N. of a place.
<div n="lb"/>{%—Vasiṣṭha-bhṛgv-atri-sama, as, ā, am,%} equal
<div n="lb"/>to (the three great saints) Vasiṣṭha, Bhṛgu, and
<div n="lb"/>Atri (all three being reckoned among the nine
<div n="lb"/>Prajā-patis, Manu I. 35). {%—Vasiṣṭha-saṃhitā,%} f.,
<div n="lb"/>N. of a philosophical treatise; {%= yoga-vāsiṣṭha.%}
<div n="lb"/>{%—Vasiṣṭhāpavāha (°ṭha-ap°), as,%} m., N. of a place
<div n="lb"/>on the Sarasvatī (where that river carried the Ṛṣi Va-
<div n="lb"/>siṣṭha away so that he escaped from Viśvā-mitra).
