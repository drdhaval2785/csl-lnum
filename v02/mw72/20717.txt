{#tATABAvya#}¦ {%tāthābhāvya, as, ā, am%} (fr. {%tathā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhāva%}), a N. for the Svarita accent at the end of the
<div n="lb"/>first member of a compound when an Udātta syllable
<div n="lb"/>immediately follows, (the low-sounding vowel in such
<div n="lb"/>a position cannot strictly be called either Svarita or
<div n="lb"/>Anudātta-tara, and a new name is therefore given
<div n="lb"/>to it; this may often happen in the case of two
<div n="lb"/>separate words, but the vowel is then called An-
<div n="lb"/>udātta-tara.)
