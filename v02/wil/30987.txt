{#meru#}¦ m. ({#-ruH#}) The sacred mountain {%Meru,%} in the centre of the
seven continents, compared to the cup or seed-vessel of the lotus, the leaves of
which are formed by the different {%Dvīpas:%} its height is said by the
{%Hindus%} to be 84,000 {%Yojanas,%} sixteen thousand of which are below the
surface of the earth: the shape is variously described, as square, conical,
columnar, spherical, or spiral; and the four faces of it are of various colours,
or white towards the east, yellow to the south, back to the west, and red
towards the north: the river {%Ganges%} falls from heaven on its summit, and
flows thence to the surrounding worlds in four streams; the southern branch is
the {%Ganges%} of {%India,%} the northern running into {%Tartary%} is the
{%Bhadrasomā,%} the eastern is the {%Sītā,%} and the western the {%Cakṣu%}
or {%Oxus:%} on the summit of {%Meru%} BRAHMĀ resides, attended and worshipped
by the {%Ṛṣis, Gandharbas,%} &c.; the regents of the points of the compass
occupy the corresponding faces of the mountain, the whole of which consists of
gold and gems: considered in any but a fabulous light, mount {%Meru%} appears
to mean the high land of {%Tārtary,%} immediately to the north of the
{%Himālaya%} mountains.
