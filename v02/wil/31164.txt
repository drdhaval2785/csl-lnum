{#yajus#}¦ n. ({#-juH#}) The {%Yajur%} or {%Yajuṣ,%} one of the four
{%Vedas;%} it is divided into two principal portions, the white and black, or
{%Vājasaneyi%} and {%Taittirīya,%} the former of which is attributed to the
saint YĀJÑAVALKYA, to whom it was revealed by the sun, in the form of a horse;
and the latter to TITTIRI, to whom it was communicated by YĀSKA, the first
pupil of its original author, the sage VAIŚAMPĀYANA: according to the
{%Purāṇas,%} the {%Taittirīya%} portion was named from {%Tittiri%} a
partridge; the disciples of VAIŚAMPĀYANA being changed into those birds, to
pick up the texts of the {%Veda,%} as they were disgorged in a tangible shape
by YĀJÑAVALKYA, at the command of VAIŚAMPĀYANA: both portions of this
{%Veda%} are very full on the subject of religious rites, and the prayers
peculiar to it, are chiefly in measured and poetical prose.
