{#loka#}¦ m. ({#-kaH#})
.²1 Man, mankind.
.²2 A world, a division of the universe; in general three {%Lokas%} are
enumerated, or heaven, hell, and earth: another classification enumerates seven,
exclusive of the infernal regions; or {%Bhūr-loka%} the earth,
{%Bhuvar-loka%} the space between the earth and the sun, the region of the
{%Munis, Siddhis,%} &c.; {%Svarloka%} the heaven of INDRA, between the sun and
the polar star; {%Maharloka%} the usual abode of BHṚGU, and other saints,
who are supposed to be co-existent with BRAHMĀ: during the conflagration of
these lower worlds, the saints ascend to the next, or {%Janaloka,%} which is
described as the abode of BRAHMĀ'S sons, SANAKA, SĀNANDA, SANĀTANA, and
SANATKUMĀRA; above this, is the fifth world 
[Page724]
 or the {%Tapoloka,%}
where the deities called {%Vairāgis%} reside; the seventh world, {%Satyaloka%} 
{%or Brahmaloka,%} is the abode of BRAHMĀ, and translation to this world exempts
beings from further birth; the three first worlds are destroyed at the end of
each {%Kalpa%} or day of BRAHMĀ; the three last at the end of his life, or of
100 of his years; the fourth {%Loka%} is equally permanent, but is
uninhabitable from heat, at the time the three first are burning: another
enumeration calls these seven worlds, earth, sky, heaven, middle region, place
of births, mansion of the blest, and abode of truth, placing the sons of BRAHMĀ
in the sixth division, and stating the fifth or {%Janaloka%} to be that, where
animals destroyed in the general conflagration are born again.
.²3 Sight, seeing.
.²4 An element, a primary or radical part of being.
.E. {#loka#} to see, aff. {#Ga#}.
