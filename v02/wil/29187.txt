{#maRqaleSvara#}¦ m. ({#-raH#}) A sovereign, a monarch.
.E. {#maRqala#} a district, and {#ISvara#} a sovereign; the power of this prince
is limited by AMARA, and the {%Maṇḍaleśvara%} is considered as an emperor or
supreme prince, only when in addition to his territorial sway, he has performed
the {%Rājasūya%} sacrifice, or sacrifice in which he has been attended by all
his tributary or subject princes: other authorities confound the sovereign of a
{%Maṇḍala,%} with the {%Cakravartī%} or emperor, and with the {%Samrāj%} or
lord paramount, and others confine him to the government of a district of twenty
or forty {%Yojanas%} in each direction.
