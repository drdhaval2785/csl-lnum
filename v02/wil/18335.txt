.E. {#dakza#} the {%Brahmādika,%} as DAKṢA, {#aDvara#} a sacrifice,
{#DvaMsakft#} subduer or disturber: DAKṢA having on one occasion made a
sacrifice, to which he invited all the gods, except his son-in law ŚIVA, and
his wife SATI, the latter went unbid, and being received coolly, threw herself
into the fire; an emanation of ŚIVA, proceeded against DAKṢA, and an affray
ensued, in which the gods and {%Ṛṣis%} were maltreated and dispersed, and
DAKṢA decapitated; he was restored to life, and the head of a ram substituted
for the one he had lost.
