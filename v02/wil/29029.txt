{#makara#}¦ m. ({#-raH#})
.²1 A marine monster, confounded usually with the crocodile and shark, but
properly a fabulous animal: as a fish; it might be conjectured to be the horned
shark, or the unicorn fish; but it is often drawn, as in the pictured signs of
the zodiac, with the head and forelegs of an antelope, and the body and tail of
a fish: it is the emblem of the god of love.
.²2 One of the signs of zodiac, corresponding with CAPRICORN, and like the
{%Greek%} representation of that sign, being an animal in the foreparts, and
ending in the tail of a fish.
.²3 One of KUVERA'S treasures.
.E. {#ma#} for {#muKa#} the mouth, {#kf#} to scatter, aff. {#ac#}; or {#mAN#}
prohibitive aff., {#kf#} to do, {#ac#} aff., form irr.; grammarians however,
sometimes consider this word as a primitive.
