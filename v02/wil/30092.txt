{#mAkzika#}¦ n. ({#-kaM#})
.²1 A mineral substance, of which two kinds are described; the {#svarRamAkzika#}
or gold {%Mākṣika,%} of a bright yellow colour, apparently the common pyritic
iron ore: and the {#rUpyamAkzika#} or silver {%Mākṣika,%} which answers in
appearance to the {%Hepatic%} pyrites of iron; other names of these ores occur;
as, {#viwmAkzika#} and {#kAMsyamAkzika#}, or feculent {%Mākṣika%} and mixed
metal {%Mākṣika;%} they are however, perhaps rather synonyms of the gold and
silver ore, respectively, than names of distinct species.
.²2 Honey.
.E. {#mAkzikA#} a bee, {#aR#} aff. of derivation; the name is applied to the
ore, from its honey-like colour.
