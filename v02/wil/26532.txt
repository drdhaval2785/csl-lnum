.E. {#pra#} before {#mA#} to measure, aff. {#lyuw#}; that by which all is
measured; this word is generally restricted to the singular number, as
{#vedAH-pramARaM#} the {%Vedas%} are the authority; it is also confined to the
neuter gender, as {#puttraH pramARaM#} the boy is a witness; some exceptions
occur however, as {#pramARaH puruzaH, pramARA strI#} the man witness, the woman
witness; and in the following rule, {#pratyakzAnuBAnopamAnaSabdAH-pramARAni#}
perception, inference, comparison, and sound, are proofs.
