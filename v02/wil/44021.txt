{#hariScandra#}¦ m. ({#-ndraH#}) A sovereign, the twenty-eighth of the solar
dynasty in the second age, celebrated for his piety and liberality, and who on
those accounts was elevated, together with his subjects, to heaven: having been
insidiously induced by NĀRADA, to relate his actions with unbecoming pride, he
descended from {%Svarga,%} a stage at each sentence, till stopping in time, and
doing homage to the gods, he was fixed with his capital in mid-air.
.E. {#hari#} VIṢṆU, and {#candra#} the moon.
